Notable Features
Liyue features many unique mechanics and environmental hazards:
The Chasm
* Five Bedrock Keys are found in the aboveground part of The Chasm which must be destroyed to break the seal over the The Chasm: Underground Mines Underground Mines in the Surreptitious Seven-Star Seal Sundering. The player must charge each nearby Cage-Shaped Geo Formation using Geogranum Geograna, then attack the formation to strike the key. The key is destroyed when this has been done with all the nearby formations.
* Dangerous Gas reacts with Electro and Pyro, producing an explosion, while Anemo temporarily dissipates it.
* Exploding Geo Mushrooms '(unofficial name)' explode after a short delay, sometimes destroying nearby structures. The player and enemies will incur damage if they are near one when it explodes.
* The Lumenstone Adjuvant is obtained during the Chasm Spelunkers. When equipped and energized, it lights the player's surroundings in The Chasm: Underground Mines and enables certain actions. The Adjuvant is disabled if unequipped or drained of energy.
** The Adjuvant's energy is quickly recharged to full when the player stands next to certain objects with the Adjuvant equipped:
*** Teleport Waypoint (when activated)
*** Ruin Brazier (if unlocked)
*** Lumenlamp (if unlocked)
*** Luminous Seelie
** Other actions can restore a limited amount of energy to the equipped Adjuvant:
*** Interacting with Concentrated Lumenstone Energy '(unofficial name)'
*** Breaking glowing ore rocks
*** Killing Bluethunder Weasel
*** Catching Lucklight Fly
*** Collecting Starshroom
** Some objects may be surrounded by a blue seal, which require spending 1 energy with the Adjuvant to unlock it before the player can interact with it:
*** Chest
*** Lumenlamp
*** Ruin Brazier
*** Time Trial Challenge
** Lumentorches '(unofficial name)' can be activated when approached by the player stands nearby with the energized Adjuvant equipped, or by a Luminous Seelie. This does not cost any of the Adjuvant's energy. Lighting all nearby Lumentorches unlocks a chest.
** Dark Mud quickly drains energy from the Adjuvant while inhibiting Sprinting and sapping the player's HP. Enemies within it gain ATK and Resistance to all DMG. If an Oozing Concretion is found within a patch of mud, a sufficiently-upgraded Adjuvant can be used to destroy it, which will disperse the mud and potentially reveal objects it covered. Oozing Concretions and their associated Dark Mud respawn with the next Reset.
** The Hidden Exploration Objective 'Secret Messages in The Chasm' requires the player to locate and interact with nine glowing rune phrases on the walls. A rune phrase will disappear if the player nears it with the Adjuvant equipped and energized, preventing interaction. The player must unequip or drain the Adjuvant first.</text>

<title>Boethius</title>
<text>Boethius was a historical figure from Fontaine and a Harmost of the God King Remus.
Profile
Boethius was once considered one of the greatest musicians in Fontaine. He originally belonged to a "barbarian tribe" that Remuria had conquered; after joining the Court of Remuria, he abandoned the "ancient savage customs" he had grown up with and became a servant of the God King Remus.Golden Era's Prelude He eventually became one of four Harmosts in the court of Remuria who Remus promoted and shared his power and authority with; as such, he was granted governmental power and oversaw Remuria with Remus.Echoes of the Ancient Worldpage=The History of the Decline and Fall of Remuria
Story
Early Years
Boethius came from a puny realm on a lone isle, in a village built of reeds and grass. One day, warriors from Remuria came to the village and announced that they would be conquering the lands of the isle. Boethius was considered a "child of barbarism," and naively followed the warriors back to Remuria. His talents helped him escape the fate of slavery, even gaining the recognition of Remus himself and becoming the God King's servant. At some unknown point, Boethius was appointed by Remus as a Harmost, giving him governmental authority.
During the conquest of Aremorica, the tribe which Erinnyes and Cassiodor belonged to, Boethius befriended Cassiodor, who defected from his tribe and joined Remuria.page=Splendor of Tranquil Waters The two became very close and referred to each other as brothers, and Cassiodor later also became a Harmost of the God King himself.Golden Song's Variation
As a Harmost
After Boethius became the Harmost of Remus, he learnt of the Primordial Sea, its essential role in Remuria, and the prophesied destruction of Remuria in a flood. Remus eventually descended into madness, mixing primordial water with an immortal stone to create a golden Ichor which would contain his people's souls. Despite this, Boethius carried out Remus' orders, hunting down Barbarians and Lochfolks and corrupting the primordial water, with the hope of protecting Remuria's peoples from the flood by dissolving them in the Ichor.Golden Night's Bustle It is said that everywhere Boethius went, the aqueducts of the empire were built and Oceanids disappeared without a trace.page=Spring of Pure Sacred Dewdrop
Rebellion of the Barbarians
The Dragon Scylla eventually led a rebellion of barbarians and vishaps against Remuria.page=Song of Stillness In response, Boethius ordered the destruction of all the "barbarian tribes," which plunged Remuria into ceaseless war and rebellion and abruptly ended its golden era. The agony of the barbarian tribes awoke the sleeping Remus,page=Golden Bird's Shedding who realized his wrongdoing as Remuria was being destroyed and gave his final order in an attempt to save the empire. However, it was too late—Boethius saw his retreat as a betrayal and rallied the last of Remura's armies to steal the golden Ichor and seal Scylla underneath the tall tower with it.page=Golden Goblet of the Pristine Sea Remus and Boethius, along with Scylla, were all swept away with Remuria and its people by an "inexorable storm," heavily implied to be the Abyss. The golden Ichor was eventually corroded by the Primordial Sea.Essence of Pure Sacred Dewdrop
Legacy
Today, Boethius is still hailed as one of the greatest musicians of Fontaine. His experience of the fall of Remuria became a reminder to the artists of Fontaine of the "inescapable cycle" of Teyvat.

<title>Normal Boss</title>
<text>Normal Boss challenges contain enemies much stronger than Elite Enemies, but also provide better rewards for defeating them. Some bosses may require prerequisites to access.
Unlike Elite Enemies, once they have been defeated a Trounce Blossom will spawn in the area, and players can use Original Resin to open them to claim their rewards. Most Normal Bosses respawn 5 minutes after they were first loaded, but all players must reload the surrounding area by teleporting to the nearest Teleport Waypoint or logging out of the game before challenging them again. The exact time remaining until the boss respawns can be seen in the Enemies tab of the Adventurer Handbook.
Normal Boss enemies reward Adventure EXP along with a certain amount of Mora and Companionship EXP. They may also drop some Character Level-Up Materials and Artifacts which scale on the player's World Level.
In some rare cases, a Normal Boss may consist of multiple Elite Enemies. This has only happened with the Coral Defenders challenge, where the boss actually consists of a Rimebiter Bathysmal Vishap and a Bolteater Bathysmal Vishap.
List of Normal Bosses
All bosses can drop any of the artifact categories for the following artifact sets:

<title>House of the Hearth</title>
<text>The House of the Hearth is an orphanage run by "The Knave" Arlecchino of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers. Orphans within the house are often raised directly into the Fatui's ranks or remain closely affiliated with the organization by way of their relation to Arlecchino.
Overview
My dear Snezheviches, my dear Snezhevnas, my brothers and sisters
If I were to one day cease my journey and slumber under the white birch, please carry on without me...
The House of the Hearth was set up by the previous Knave.Momoyo's intelligence directly indicates that the title of "The Knave" was passed down and that the current Arlecchino, who succeeded the previous Knave, was herself a member of the House of the Hearth as a child. It is unknown how many times the name and title have been passed down.
Orphans raised in the House of the Hearth are gathered from all over the continent, likely to make it easier for people who are ethnically from a certain nation to blend in with its people,Shuumatsuban Operations Buzuleac: We were all brought up in similar circumstances, but it's just easier for people with Inazuman blood like her to create a fake identity, you know? and those who clearly belong to a certain ethnicity (such as Lyudochka Snezhevna, who was of Inazuman descent) may study affairs relating to their native land from a young age.The Replacement's Secret
Once children raised in the House of the Hearth grow up, those who are deemed to "have potential" are enlisted in the Fatui and are dispatched as sleeper agents to other nations to await orders.The Bad Guy in Vimara VillageThe Foolish Fatuus Oleg: Hmph, Trofin Snezhevich... That guy didn't achieve anything here in the past few years, whereas I have already gotten results. Well, won't we see what he has to say for himself then? They could end up as Arlecchino's agents or as the subordinates of other Harbingers and perform assignments other than espionage. The fates of children without "potential" has not been addressed.
Those raised in the House of the Hearth view each other as "family" and refer to their bonds as being "tighter than blood." Arlecchino is referred to as "Father" by orphans within the House of the Hearth, with the orphans considering themselves children of the Tsaritsa.page=Lies Cast Shadows Under Gathered Lights
Orphans raised within the House of the Hearth are given the surnames "Snezhevich" and "Snezhevna" for males and females respectively. Some orphans will be given new names entirely along with their designated surname.
There is currently only one known location the House of the Hearth operates in, the Hotel Bouffes d'ete in the Court of Fontaine, although it is implied that other orphanages exist outside of Fontaine.page=Lies Cast Shadows Under Gathered Lights Lyney: All of us House members here, Lady Arlecchino herself included, are from Fontaine. Lyney's phrasing may suggest there are House of the Hearth orphanages outside of Fontaine.

<title>Akuou</title>
<text>"Akuou" ja=惡王 ja_rm=Akuou, also known as Touzannou ja=東山王 ja_rm=Touzannou amongst the Watatsumi people, was a historical figure from Watatsumi Island, Inazuma who lived around two thousand years ago. He was a major figure in the Narukami-Watatsumi War.
Akuou wielded the claymore Akuoumaru, which has since been named after him.Akuoumaru The Formation Estate was built on the mountain that he conquered during the Watatsumi Islanders' invasion of Yashiori Island.
Profile
Akuou was one of the three generals of Watatsumi's invasion force during the Narukami-Watatsumi War over Yashiori Island around 2,000 years ago. For his accomplishments in battle, Orobashi granted him the title "Touzannou" (King of the Eastern Mountain). Akuou dueled the Great Tengu Sasayuri and may have been the one who killed them. He was later slain alongside Orobashi when Ei unleashed Musou no Hitotachi.
Story
An orphan of unknown origins and without a name, Akuou was taken in by Orobashi and was apprenticed to the shrine maiden Mouun and her twin sister Ayame. He was particularly close with Mouun, and his biography indicates that the two were lovers.Debates on the "Viceroy of the East"
From the two, Akuou learned the art of whalesong and the rites of Watatsumi, and also developed his own blade techniques known as "Getsumouun" and "Yuushio."
Narukami-Watatsumi War
Along with Orobashi, Akuou, Ayame, and Mouun led the Watatsumi people in the invasion of Yashiori Island, which was under Makoto's jurisdiction. While they did so largely to gain access to Yashiori Island's abundant natural resources and make up for Watatsumi Island's natural deficiencies,A Preliminary Study of Sangonomiya Folk Belief Akuou also did so partially for his own ego: He bragged to Mouun and Ayame that he would one day duel against the Great Tengu, Sasayuri, and bring their Tengu mask back as a prize.Mouun's MoonEverlasting Moonglow
The Watatsumi forces succeeded in conquering and annexing Yashiori Island. Akuou - who had distinguished himself in battle - became its vassal ruler, gaining the title of "Touzannou" (King of the Eastern Mountain) from Orobashi.The original Chinese text states the Watatsumi people called all of Yashiori Island "Eastern Mountain," and further indicates that they had annexed the whole island. See Debates on the "Viceroy of the East" Notes Debates on the "Viceroy of the East" § Notes for details. When word reached Narukami Island, Makoto was preoccupied with domestic affairs, so Ei led a force to subjugate the invaders. Sasayuri participated in the war and lost their life in the conflict following a duel against Akuou.
At the end of the war, Akuou was slain alongside Orobashi when Ei punished them with Musou no Hitotachi, splitting Yashiori Island in half and creating Musoujin Gorge in the process.Formation Estate Mouun was slain by Sasayuri's subordinates and had her body taken away, while Ayame disappeared into the ocean and was never heard of again. Watatsumi Island was thus left in the hands of the Divine Priestess, who had not participated in battle and instead remained on the island.
Legacy
Akuou's "Getsumouun" and "Yuushio" sword styles continue to be used by Watatsumi soldiers to this day, and remarkable warriors are known as "scions of Touzannou."
In modern times, "Akuou" has become the more well-known name for him.

Profile
Appearance
According to legend, Nabu Malikata was said to have "beautiful" horns on her head. The horns of Nilou's crown in her default outfit, Neither Flower Nor Mist, were made in reflection of this trait.
When the Traveler sees Nabu Malikata in Liloupar's memories, they describe her appearance as being "ineffably beautiful," comparable to "the totality of her Jinn." However, when the Traveler meets her gaze, they are faced with "nothingness."The Eternal Dream, Ever Lush
Story
Nabu Malikata, the Goddess of Flowers, lived during the time when the Second Who Came arrived from beyond the firmament and brought war to her kin, though she acknowledges that they "brought about illusions that could break through shackles to the land." She was later "cast aside by the heavens" along with the rest of her kin, who were punished for an unknown sin by becoming stripped of their minds and becoming husks of their former selves. Somehow, Nabu Malikata was able to maintain her original form. According to legend, she wandered the barren wastes for seventy-two days. Springs gushed from her wounds, becoming streams that flowed into gardens. Water lilies grew in these gardens, and the Jinn were born from them. The first jinn begged her to stay with them, and she relented. Purple flowers resembling the moon bloomed wherever she stopped, and they were called Padisarahs.
Some time later, she met Greater Lord Rukkhadevata and King Deshret, who shared his throne with them, even though most of Teyvat's gods were warring against each other for power during the Archon War. They were known as the God-Kings of Sumeru and were good friends. Nabu Malikata and King Deshret built the ancient civilization of Ay-Khanoum in the desert as an earthly paradise.Oasis Garden's Mourning The Goddess of Flowers was the originator and namesake of the Sabzeruz Festival zh=花神诞日 zh_tl=Birthday of the Goddess of Flowers, which originally commemorated Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's birthday.The Trail of the God of Wisdom After Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's death, the Sabzeruz Festival became a celebration for her successor Lesser Lord Kusanali's birthday.Philby
At some point in time, Nabu Malikata foresaw the coming of the cataclysm so she created a shard of Khvarena, whom she referred to as her daughter. This shard would eventually transform into the divine bird Simurgh. The divine bird would be destined to sacrifice itself during the cataclysm in order to save the Amrita Pool Amrita that is being corrupted by the abyss. Nabu Malikata gave the shard to Rukkhadevata as she believed that Rukkhadevata's "light" is more radiant than hers.Vourukasha's Glow
King Deshret was ambitious and rejected "the gift granted by the divine throne," wanting to seek his own path for his people. Nabu Malikata warned him not to seek forbidden knowledge, telling him not to seek the Primordial One Master of the Four Shades and inquire the mysteries of the stars and abyss. She told him about the Divine Nail divine nails and the calamities they caused. However, King Deshret remained undeterred and told her about his own ambitions. Nabu Malikata admired his rebellious spirit and decided to assist him in seeking the hidden knowledge, all the while knowing that she would die. Greater Lord Rukkhadevata was heartbroken by her fellow God-Kings' plans, so she shepherded her own people away to create an oasis in a corner of the desert, leaving Nabu Malikata to wait for a return that never came.Dune-Entombed Fecundity: Part IIIOlden Days of Scorching Might
According to legend, Nabu Malikata died "due to the malice of the burning sun and yellow sand." While the actual cause of her death is currently unknown, it has been suggested that she had planned her death so that the bitterness of her death would preserve her legacy forever. King Deshret, who was enamored with her, never realized her intentions.Oasis Garden's Truth
The original Padisarah flower went extinct with her death, and although Greater Lord Rukkhadevata attempted to recreate the flowers, she was unable to recreate its original shade of purple.
Following Nabu Malikata's death, King Deshret eventually descended into madness and was further deceived by his counsels.The Lay of Al-Ahmar

Elemental Gauge Theory
Overview
Crystallize shards last on the field for close to 17.5 seconds, though there is a short delay before they can be picked up. If more than 3 shards are on the field, after about 2 seconds all shards except the 3 newest ones will disappear. The shields they grant last for 15 seconds. Only a single player-made crystallize shield can be active at any time; picking up another shard simply replaces the old shield. Crystallize shards have no effect on enemies.
Crystallize can only be triggered once per second on the same target.
Note that Geovishap Hatchlings and the Pure Geo Hypostasis can create Geo Elemental Shards during combat, but these are different from the Elemental Shards generated by Crystallize. While the shards and the shield granted when picked up look similar aside from the color, the resulting Geo shield can stack with regular Crystallize shields-it does not override them.
Shield Health
A Crystallize shield's base health (damage absorption) is derived from the triggering Geo user's level, and is then increased by a certain percent depending on the Geo user's Attributes Elemental Mastery Elemental Mastery attribute.
Like all other shields, these elemental shields absorb a set amount of damage before breaking and are 250% effective against their own element (meaning they only take 40% as much damage from said element compared to othersYouTube: ) and increase Interruption Resistance while active.
Crystallize shields can stack with shields from talents and constellations in that no shields are overwritten, but each shield will take full damage at the same time.HoYoverse News:
A character's Attributes Shield Strength Shield Strength attribute reduces the damage taken by any shields they have while they are active, rather than increasing the HP of shields they create.Reddit: NGA: 结晶反应护盾值计算相关]

Elemental Trial
text1  = When Geo attacks come into contact with Hydro/Pyro/Cryo/Electro, Crystallize will be triggered. This reaction will create Elemental Shards of the corresponding element, which can provide characters with shielding of that element. Make good use of Crystallize to effectively decrease DMG taken in battle.
text2  = Use Hydro, Pyro, Cryo and Electro attacks in battle to infuse opponents with the elements. Switch to a Geo character and use Geo attacks to trigger the Crystallize reaction and obtain a shield. Perhaps you may yet defeat your opponents without taking so much a scratch yourself...

<title>Neuvillette/Lore</title>
<text>You wouldn't exactly describe the Iudex of Fontaine as "approachable." It's hard to say whether it's just in his nature, or because he has secrets to hide.
Personality
The Chief Justice of Fontaine, known as the Iudex, is renowned for his unassailable impartiality.
In accordance to his role as the Chief Justice, Neuvillette takes the court and trials very seriously, handing out verdicts with impartiality. He is notably perceptive, being able to hear Paimon's whispers and is able to deduce the additional details from the evidence provided to him during a trial. He utilizes the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale to make the final decision, honoring its request regardless of his own feelings on the matter as per protocol.
Due to his position and ties to the Hydro Archon, he is popular among Fontaine's people as a symbol of justice and honor. As a member of the Seven Sovereigns, Neuvillette is unfamiliar with human customs and feelings, using the court to help him process and understand them. He rarely spends his time out in public, as he does not enjoy unwanted attention, and in the few times he speaks to humans, he appears to be aloof, though honest in his words. However, when interacting with Melusines, he is extremely friendly, seen as the ideal father by them; likewise, he is fiercely protective of them, considering them the pride of Fontaine and investigating matters himself should he hear of a Melusine being bullied or threatened. This stems from his failure to protect his friend and subordinate, Carole, when she was driven to death due to Fontainian's prejudice, and Neuvillette being forced to sentence his other friend, Vautrin, for carrying out a revenge killing for Carole, he had since resolved to prevent such tragedy from happening ever again.
When he was initially reincarnated, Neuvillette was left with many questions about himself, leading to him accepting a position as the Iudex. His time overseeing trials led him to experience a plethora of human experiences and emotions, which was secretly prepared by Focalors in the hopes that his newfound perception would save the people of Fontaine from a Prophecy of Fontaine looming prophecy that would exterminate them. Upon learning the full extent of Focalors' deception, he admitted that she was devious and was both saddened and shocked by her self-sacrifice. Indeed, having seen humanity positively, Neuvillette used his fully restored powers to save the people and left aside fragments of his power in the form of Visions for those worthy of them.
Neuvillette opposes the Heavenly Principles, and by extension The Seven, as they usurped the authority of the Dragons that once ruled Teyvat. This appears to be more of a professional standpoint than a personal matter, as he expresses surprise at the current status of some Archons, like Barbatos, while respecting Lesser Lord Kusanali for her duties.
Despite his appearance, Neuvillette enjoys water and is an avid taster, being able to discern the properties of where the water came from and how it's prepared; as a result, this also extends to him liking food with plenty of sauce. He does not like deep fried food and grilled food with no sauce, especially taking great offence to Charcoal-Baked Ajilenakh Cakes.
Appearance
Clear Adjudication
Neuvillette uses the Tall Male Characters tall male model. He has pale skin, dark blue-shaded slit eyes, pointed ears, and waist length white hair with a single lock that has a blue underside. He also has what appears to be two bright, blue horn-like accessories at shoulder length.
Official Introduction
Neuvillette: He who looks down on all that are haughty
Someday, when Seven Sovereigns they return, their true ordeal shall begin.
"Given that our previous behind-the-scenes editorial on the Focalors Hydro Archon earned us the honorable epithet of 'tabloid journalism' from our dear Monsieur Neuvillette, this time we'll be focusing on the mysterious Iudex himself. We know little indeed of his true character, and sadly our multiple requests for an interview were all turned down. Instead, we have decided to reach out and draw upon the wisdom of the masses. In the pursuit of the truth, all anonymous submissions and attestations of manifestly questionable veracity have been filtered out. We were rather intrigued, however, by the following letter written in a particularly adorable script:
...
"If the Diluc Darknight Hero really does exist, he's probably just someone in disguise. When he gets up in the morning to brush his teeth, it's the real him. Only in the dead of night does he become the Darknight Hero. But not (Monsieur) Neuvillette. The Chief Justice IS the real him. For us Melusines, our ideal of the perfect father — that's also the real him. The only person that isn't really him is the one that goes by the name of Neuvillette."
From this, we can safely surmise... that Neuvillette must be the only male Melusine! Granted, the Melusines actually appeared much later than when Neuvillette took up his post. But in the face of such ironclad evidence, there's bound to be some way of explaining this!"
— Seven Nations Gazette, a notorious tabloid
Character Stories
Neuvillette is a solitary person.Fontainians who have tried to get close to him have, without exception, been politely rejected. To this day, no one even knows his first name, since he has always asked that he be referred to by his last name.He believes that close personal ties will lead to suspicions about the justness of one's judgments, while he must remain a symbol of absolute justice.Of course, there will always be people who just won't give up. They will say, "Come now, Monsieur Neuvillette. Not everyone will stand trial, nor will you always have to remain in the judge's seat."But is that really the case? If there is an answer in his heart, Neuvillette will not reveal it.Given enough time, every river will overflow and flood. Every last Fontainian is guilty, with judgment and doom certain to one day fall upon them - this is neither metaphor nor rhetoric.Yet, Neuvillette can share this fact with no one.Truly, he is a lonesome person.
Neuvillette is not known for his personal desires.Curious members of the public and journalists are wont to seek high and low for him all across Fontaine when he is not sitting in the Chief Justice's seat of judgment. He may sit at a seat for specially invited guests during performances, appear by the shore when the skies are just on the cusp of weeping, or be standing within the shadows cast by the afternoon sun.There was once a time when all believed that he was some kind of demon who existed solely to preside over trials and judge, forcing him to clarify that... Well, the gist of it was "to bear witness and judge is my great honor, but I am not a trial aficionado. Iudex is simply one of the hats I wear, and my time as a judge is but one phase of my life."This successful clarification led him out of the frying pan, and into the fire, as they say - "Shocking News! Neuvillette Claims 'Iudex' to be 'Springboard' Post! Unspeakable Plans Next; Where Will His Ambition End?"As for the new rumors, Neuvillette paid them no heed. Perhaps they were, in fact, right on the Mora, and he simply did not correct them out of principle? No one knows.Neuvillette is also not much of a drinker, nor does he like Fonta - indeed, he has never even been known to have given any sincere praise to the local chefs' most renowned dishes. This has led people to suspect that his lack of consumptive desire might come down to him simply not having a sense of taste.His response was to organize a water-tasting salon party, at which all were gobsmacked by the wide variety of flavors water from different regions could possess and floored by the Iudex's most refined tastes. Of course, the amount of authenticity present in such interactions cannot be known.But whatever the case, Neuvillette really is devoid of selfish want.
Neuvillette is a just person.If not for that quality, he probably would not have been qualified to serve as the Iudex in the first place.To the children, the job of the man in the judge's seat is nothing more than wearing a wig, maintaining order in the court, and being the Oratrice's messenger pigeon. In truth, however, there are many administrative affairs that he must handle in private to keep the justice system up and running.Due to certain historical and traditional legacies in Fontaine, the Iudex also has the right to prosecute, as well as the power to enforce the law in person. This was originally intended to make it easier to maintain law and order during chaotic times, but as the system became further refined, this rule, which represented the spirit of the pioneer far more than that of the law, became maintained only symbolically. When the Iudex investigates a case or serves as the prosecutor, they must recuse themselves as judge, and have someone else take the seat. And in the few instances where he has personally investigated cases, Neuvillette has unerringly followed this rule.One thing to note is that he has been the only Iudex in the land for a very long time, so much so that people often speculate that he must have been given an unimaginably long life due to divine favor. As such, it is well that he is nothing if not fair-minded, or such an extensive term would surely lead to problems someday.As to what he is precisely - a familiar of the Hydro Archon, or a mysterious Hydro elemental creature, perhaps - there are a great many opinions, though Neuvillette has never once commented on such talk.Indeed, he is a person most impartial.
Due to a variety of reasons, Fontaine's legal codices retain all manner of odd articles from days past. Neuvillette himself contributed this clause: "A Melusine shall be addressed as 'she,' rather than 'it,' for they are people too."This might look strange on its face, but the more one considers it, the more it makes sense. After all, Melusines have been found all over Fontaine since near-modern times, and fighting for equal rights for them beginning with terms of address sent a powerful signal.Indeed, Fontainians have noticed that Neuvillette displays different amounts of warmth toward Melusines and humans. Most regard this as the understated goodness in his heart having found an outlet, becoming the love of a father.Oddly enough, this one only gets stranger the more one knows about Neuvillette.For he is the Hydro Dragon, and in this capacity, he regards Melusines as dependents and successors, and also as the finest example of a new sort of Hydro Vishap species. Yet he is also the destroyer of the present order, the one who shall judge all gods, and the foe of humanity. So why, then, did he secure human rights for the Melusines?You alone could ask him this question, and this was his reply: "It wasn't up to me. Melusines simply prefer being around humans, that's all."
Neuvillette has always favored rainy days over sunny ones, as the moisture-laden air helps him relax. However, it has been a long time since he last delighted in standing under the rain.It seems that from the time he chose to walk alongside Fontaine, he began to play the role of a strictly law-abiding normal person. Of course, normal people would not walk through the rain without an umbrella, allowing the rain to drench their hair.It is worth mentioning that the role of Chief Justice is as much his true self as the Hydro Dragon is his essence. Only the role of "normal human" is one he must play.It was in their solitude and guilt that humans invented a god to judge them, and in their greed and guilt that they created a god to save them. And with that god no longer present, it falls to Neuvillette to fulfill such expectations.He has pardoned humanity, and has regained his original form.Now, he can finally walk in the rain and enjoy it.Indeed, he did do exactly this, and standing in the rain, he gazed into the distance, reminiscing about that day, so long ago, when he had received that letter.Yes, a letter had found its way to him by some unknown means. The name of the recipient had been left blank, with the text only addressing him bluntly as "you."A special you. A unique you. Neuvillette was not opposed to such a manner, but neither did he approve of it. He felt, vaguely, that the powers-that-be of the present world had no real right to judge him so.He knew that this letter had been written by the Archon Focalors, who was inviting him to come and see Fontaine, claiming "I shall leave you a seat with the best view in the greatest theater."Later, he would indeed come to receive that very seat - in the middle of the front row of the Opera Epiclese on the island known as Erinnyes. He would watch all manner of performances there, and the view was indeed excellent, just as Focalors had claimed.What happened later was not made public knowledge. In all likelihood, the people had no way of understanding what it meant that the throne was shattered, or how the power of water was fully restored to its original owner. As to their being pardoned, and why they had to be forgiven in the first place, that was an even broader and more complex tale.And thus did the curtain fall - Fontaine witnessed a happy ending to the greatest drama in history.Or was it? A happy ending, that is. It was then that Neuvillette understood that the "seat" mentioned in the letter was not merely a chair in an opera house.Focalors - or Furina, he should say - had given up her seat in the audience, come onstage alone, and become the heroine of the drama.There were only ever a fixed number of seats, and for one to sit down, was for another to depart. That letter had been an invitation, issued several centuries in advance.Well, Hydro Dragon? How do you feel about becoming a member of the human audience?Are you enjoying this human drama?
One as great as he should have no need for a constellation to shine over him. After all, "fate" is merely the manner in which the present ruler of this world plays with living beings.Now that he has obtained one part of seven of the authority over the mortal realm, and reforged the throne and title of a "Fully Fledged Dragon," he is one strong enough to equal and rival "the human realm," and logic would dictate that he need not subscribe to this system known as "fate."He can see, in the skies of destiny, how many stars contend with one another, creating a complicated, fragile world. He did not initially care much about such, for the puppet strings glossed as "divine rules" would one day be burned away by the fires of judgment. But he too was taken in by certain pleasing rhetoric."In that case, why don't you just watch over the Fontainians? They were born from the Primordial Sea, after all. That makes them part of this planet's native life, too, and a form of life that requires your care."He would never admit that he himself had become quite fascinated with the joys and sorrows of humanity. Was it not so, he would argue, that humans find their gaze stolen by the ripples from falling raindrops in puddles? And could it not be, he would explain, that King Nibelung had been wrong, and that the black void could only be opposed if all life were to band together as one?Thus did he, in the end, come into his own "fate." The skies had left a special, ennobled place for him, one reserved for the overseers and those who could defy the world itself - that of his own reflection.-Of course, he was born in the form of a human. But why, then, is his name the image of the great leviathan? Well, this leads us to a more mundane explanation for the situation, one quite separate from grave matters of the world's fate:As the one named "Neuvillette," he would often be roped by Melusines (especially Sigewinne) into a bit of astrology via The Steambird's constellation columns or astrology guides from Sumeru. Would it really do, at that point, to tell them that he "didn't have a constellation" or that his own constellation was just "Neuvillette"?
"Hydro Dragon, Hydro Dragon, don't cry."No one knows who composed this children's song, or when, but it has organically spread throughout Fontaine all the same. Neuvillette has been somewhat perplexed by this. No matter how much time he has spent with Fontainians or how much they've been through together, he still cannot quite put a finger on how people view the real him - or that is to say, the Hydro Dragon.In addition to commanding the power of Hydro, the Hydro Dragon also had mastery over the sea that was the source of life. Before any outside life forms were ever created, all life on this planet traced its origins to the Primordial Sea. Indeed, those placid waters were worthy of the title of "birthing waters" or "amniotic fluid" given by those who came after. And the Hydro Dragon could, in turn, be regarded as this planet's original "God of Life."Neuvillette knows all this, of course, just like he knows that all rivers meet again in the great ocean. These birthing waters might not be of any special importance to humans, but for Neuvillette, he can differentiate every drop, every minute memory. He still remembers the foreign usurper appointing their own "God of Life" to order the living. He still remembers how the usurper had made "her" to suppress the original vital force of this planet. And of course, he also knows how Egeria "she" came to commit the original sin...Having considered all this, Neuvillette decided, then, that whoever had penned that rhyme, as well as the Fontainians who came to believe in it, must not have known the Hydro Dragon all that well, considering that they thought the Hydro Dragon could cry. What did they take said Dragon for, some sort of bleeding heart who grieved for humans and the heavens alike?
Neuvillette does not need a Vision to manipulate the elements. However, there were some things he learned only after regaining his complete form:Severely wounded in the great war of vengeance, Primordial One the usurper had their functions ruined, and could no longer use their absolute authority to suppress the original order of this world. To continue to subdue and control the resentments and loathing of the world, the usurper and one who came after created the Gnoses together. So it came to be that an order was made to be upheld, and thus did humans come to only possess these seven remembrances, and all fragments of the primordial were driven to devour each other.From that day on, whenever a person's wishes reached the heavens, the The Seven seven overseers of the material realm were duty-bound to grant them a gift. Though they might know nothing of who or what wish had stepped into the threshold of the sacred, the Seven Archons still had to impart a shattered shard of their mastery to that person. And when one so gifted completed their duty... the gift the gods would receive in return would be more abundant still.Neuvillette obeys no edict from the heavens, but he does acknowledge human will. So he too set aside parts of himself, as like unto the dragon-treasure hoards of old, awaiting valiant humans to come and claim them.

<title>Pervases</title>
<text>Pervases was one of the Yakshas who perished over a thousand years ago. He appears in Butterfly's Dream, at a run-down temple for the Adeptus adepti near the foot of Mt. Tianheng.
Profile
By wave and storm I hunt for fish, by wind and snow I slay evil...
Pervases was a junior in the Yaksha order of adepti, but perished during the Archon War. On the thousandth anniversary of his death, he performed the Mortal Lingering ritual with a censer and seven-star lamps in order to see modern Liyue. Later, he willingly gives up these objects to the Traveler so that they can perform the Dream Trawler ritual to punish Wang Ping'an Starsnatcher for impersonating an adeptus.
His favorite food was Grilled Ticker Fish,Insights of Drifting Dreams which was apparently a favorite among many adepti.Chen the Sharp
Appearance
In his human form, Pervases has short, slicked-back black hair and brown eyes. He wears a generic Liyue NPC's red robe. His illuminated beast form, seen only in-game as a statue, is a crane who adorns a necklace of large beads similar to what Xiao wears.
History
It is unknown when or how Pervases came to serve Rex Lapis, or his history before becoming a Yaksha, but the Archon personally gave him the name "Pervases." Though Pervases was slain during the Archon War, his spirit managed to linger on, dwelling within the statue of a crane in Pervases' Temple his run-down temple.
One thousand years later, on the anniversary of his death, the Traveler and Paimon run into him while seeking out a censer and the seven-star lamps so Xiao can teach them to perform the Dream Trawler ritual and punish Starsnatcher for his treachery. He senses Xiao's aura on them - and the burden of karma that Xiao bears. Pervases permits them to take the items they need, despite knowing that this would dispel the Mortal Lingering ritual he performed. After telling them the truth about himself, and leaving a message to deliver to Xiao, his spirit grows dormant again. Afterwards, Wang Ping'an, having discarded his Starsnatcher alias and become repentant, carried out a project to restore Pervases' temple to good condition.
After Rex Lapis saves Xiao in The Chasm (Subregion) The Chasm, he returns to Pervases' temple to ponder the fate of the Yakshas. It is here that it is revealed that Pervases was close with the Prime Yaksha, Bosacius, and that Xiao regrets that Pervases was one of many examples of a Yaksha who had to pay the ultimate price of death.</text>

<title>Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament</title>
<text>The Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament is a tournament that was held in Sumeru. It was organized by Kautilya, a senior Amurta researcher, and funded by Elchingen, a businessman from Fontaine. It boasts a prize pool of 60 million Mora, with another prize of Elchingen's entire fortune being given away to the person who wins the Ultimate Trial.
In the tournament, contestants are tasked with capturing Fungi, training them and then commanding them to fight with the Wisdom Orb that is provided by the organizers of the tournament.
The tournament features two Event Domain event domains: Fabulous Fungus Frenzy Special Training Nilotpala Cup Special Training Grounds and Fabulous Fungus Frenzy Championship Progress Nilotpala Cup Official Arena. Both domains are found at the respective  icon on the map.
History
During the tournament, Elchingen was exposed as a Fatuus seeking to use the fungi to cause havoc in Sumeru, while Kautilya was exposed as a fraud for plagiarizing the Wisdom Orb from a previous design. However, the tournament was positively received, so responsibility for hosting the event in the future was passed to the Traveler, the tournament's champion. However they decided that the tournament should be suspended for the time being until The Akademiya find a way to improve the design of Wisdom Orb.
After some time passed, the once-heated discussions around the first iteration of the event are slowly decreasing and the tournament is being forgotten. To prevent this from happening, Haniyyah and Balfour organized a thematic event to promote the next tournament called Fungus Mechanicus, based on Theater Mechanicus which Balfour bought the Sumeru franchising right of the game from Liyue. With the Traveler's permission, they would market this event as a spin-off of the tournament to attract more contestants and audience in the next tournament.</text>

<title>Renault de Petrichor</title>
<text>Stub
Renault de PetrichorFleuve Cendre Ferryman was a Fontaine Fontainian historical figure from the cataclysm 500 years ago. He was the mayor of Poisson and father of Rene.Enigmatic Page (IX)
Story
After the purge of Fleuve Cendre, Eduardo and other survivors were exiled to the desert. They were later rescued by Eduardo's henchmen. They then took members of Maison Gardiennage hostage and occupied Poisson with comrades active near Mont Automnequi. This is where his son Jakob met Renault's son Rene de Petrichor.
Before the Siege of Poisson, the reporter Karl Ingold took a photograph of Eduardo, Jakob, mayor Renault, Rene, Josephine "Parsifal", Rosa Reed and her husband Thompson with their infant, and Tom Alter.
Emanuel Guillotin initiated the Siege of Poisson, resulting in bloodshed that presumably led to the deaths of Renault and his wife.Enigmatic Page (II) Rene: Uncle Guillotin, who was with them, is part of the Maison Gardiennage. [...] he still can't be trusted. After all, Father and Mother... It was all the doing of their lackeys and goons...Moment of Judgment
Meanwhile, Jakob and Rene were sent to the Narzissenkreuz Institute  and became close friends with Alain and Mary-Ann.Forgotten VesselAs the Khvarena's Light Shows
After the cataclysm, at the "sites where battles took place", likely near the remains of Elynas (NPC) Elynas, Jakob and Rene coincidentally encountered Alain and Mary-Ann. Alain and Mary-Ann had been adopted by Emanuel Guillotin and became siblings. They were searching for inspiration under Emanuel's watchful eyes at that time. Rene chose not to tell them about Jakob, as he did not trust Emanuel, who was a former Marechaussee Hunter involved in the Siege of Poisson.Book of Esoteric Revelations</text>

<title>Skipper</title>
<text>The Skipper, whose real name is unknown, is a historical figure from Liyue who lived around 1,000 years ago. He is most well known for his quest for vengeance against a certain sea monster and his eventual success at the cost of his life.Tales From the WavesSerpent Spine His story is intertwined with that of Parsifal's, a former Mondstadt Aristocracy Mondstadt aristocrat who was forced to flee due to his vigilantism and ultimately took refuge on the Skipper's boat.Heart of DepthIron Sting
Tales From the Waves is a novelization of the Skipper's origin story, while Serpent Spine was his greatsword.
Profile
Story
The Skipper originally made a living out of tracking down and hunting dangerous sea monsters, using their corpses to adorn his ship. His obsession with his war trophies, however, made him out of touch with ordinary folk and even his own crew feared him more than they admired him. The only person he showed any tenderness for was his navigator, a young maiden who sang sea shanties without end.
However, the Skipper and his crew one day met their match. They faced a beast whose size alone made all other monsters they had slain look like insects by comparison. Despite fighting a long and arduous battle, it was clear that they would not win, and the monster prepared to swallow the remnants of the crew up.Tales From the Waves Nevertheless, the Skipper fought back with all he had even in the face of death. Right before he could be torn apart, however, the maiden's song distracted the monster and it targeted her instead, dragging her down into the waves to her doom. Apparently satisfied, the monster spared the Skipper, who awoke on a merchant ship after having lost his crew and all he had. He swore to avenge the maiden's death by slaying the monster once and for all.Tales From the Waves
Revenge and Death
Following the disaster, the Skipper's personality drastically changed, becoming carefree and jovial. He eventually rebuilt his crew, but skirted around the subject of his thirst for vengeance. At some point in time, Parsifal - outwitted and disgraced by his half-brother Eberhart - threw his lot in with the Skipper and signed a contract with him, promising to go with the Skipper even to his death against the sea monster if need be. By this point, Parsifal had become a depressed alcoholic who was rarely ever sober, but the Skipper didn't mind and continued giving him important tasks.
Finally, the day came that the conditions were right for his vengeance. The Skipper took his men out to sea to combat the sea monster; Parsifal died in combat and the Skipper and his men likely followed suit, as neither he nor his ship ever returned to Liyue Harbor. However, the Skipper got his revenge: some time afterwards, the corpse of a great sea monster torn apart by the marks of a greatsword washed up onto Liyue's shore.</text>

<title>Imunlaukr Clan</title>
<text>The Imunlaukr Clan was one of the founding clans of Mondstadt,Sacrificial Greatsword alongside the Gunnhildr Clan and the Lawrence Clan.
Unlike the other two clans, there has been no mention of the clan in present day, nor are any members known besides its namesake, Imunlaukr.
History
Origin
The Imunlaukr Clan is descended from Imunlaukr, the only survivor of the disaster that befell Sal Vindagnyr as he had left the region to find a way to save it. Because Imunlaukr was a foreigner to Sal Vindagnyr, his ancestry and origins are currently unknown. After returning to Sal Vindagnyr empty-handed only to find everyone dead, he decided Celestia only cared to watch the suffering of the people below, and he left to find a war-torn land to entertain them.Snow-Tombed Starsilver He likely died somewhere in the land of Mondstadt, based on the contextBlizzard Strayer and the fact that his descendants settled somewhere in the area.
During Decarabian's Rule
By the time Decarabian's Mondstadt fell, the Imunlaukr Clan had become known for raising brave and gifted warriors that fought hard and died young. The clan as a whole adopted their progenitor's viewpoint that combat was merely for the entertainment of the gods and as such, would fight anyone and anything for the sake of fighting, and not for any other purpose.
After Barbatos swept away the snow in Mondstadt and transformed it into a land of gentle breeze and verdant pastures, the Imunlaukr clan believed they had found something worth fighting for.
Early Aristocratic Period
During the time that the people of Mondstadt worshipped the gods of Anemo and Time together, the Imunlaukr clan would enact war tales using prop weapons.
There has been no mention made of the Imunlaukr Clan after the formation of new Mondstadt. However, it seems that the origin of gladiatorial combat in Mondstadt as a religious ceremony, accompanied by prayers to the gods, was inspired by the Imunlaukr Clan's culture.Royal Greatsword

<title>Callas</title>
<text>Callas is a mentioned character in 'Genshin Impact'. He is Navia's father.
Profile
Callas was the former president of Spina di Rosula. The construction of the aquabuses was sponsored by Spina di Rosula, so the Aquabus Callas line is named after him.
According to Melus and Silver, Callas was initially a respected man in Fontaine society, to the point where even Neuvillette and Clorinde spoke highly of him. He was bestowed the title of "Baron" by the Palais Mermonia, but refused it because he thought it was hollow. He had also met Wriothesley before his death.
However, after Callas was accused of murder, many turned their backs on him, calling him "Callas the Unfaithful."As Light Rain Falls Without Reason
Appearance
He had blond hair and blue eyes, and his right eye was covered by an eyepatch.
Story
Callas was the first president of the Spina di Rosula, a group dedicated to helping others and finding the truth when the local authorities could not. He had a daughter, Navia, but his wife Clementine died from complications following her birth.
At some point prior to the events of the game, Callas decided to enter a partnership with the Court of Fontaine and Fontaine Research Institute regarding the aquabus system, which he believed would improve relationships with the rest of Fontaine and also pay well in the future. This led to a deep clash with another Spina member, Romeuf, who believed that the funds used for the aquabus construction would be better off improving Poisson. Callas disagreed with this, with Clementine supporting his decision. After she died, he decided to honor her request by going forth with the construction, which led to Romeuf leaving with a fair amount of other members on extremely bad terms, who likewise despised his entire family, including Navia, who they believed was no different than him.
Three years prior to the events of the game, Callas entered a partnership with Marcel (Fontaine) Marcel, who sold the popular beverage known as Sinthe to the people of Poisson. However, Sinthe was actually water from the Primordial Sea diluted with regular water, which caused severe long-term side effects to those who drank it. Sinthe abuse eventually became a major problem, destroying many families in Fontaine. In response, Callas banned the drink and began to investigate its vendors, eventually convincing a seller named Jacques to work with him. Jacques' betrayal did not go unnoticed by his superiors, who ordered him to kill Callas. However, Jacques could not carry out the assassination, resulting in the mastermind hiring another person to commit the deed.
Callas later hosted a banquet by the countryside and went out to get air, with Jacques following suit. Everyone at the banquet suddenly heard two gunshots, and when they arrived to the scene, they found Callas with the gun and Jacques dead on the ground; Callas was then apprehended and charged with murder. This shocked his benefactors, most of whom withdrew support from him, and he began to be called "Callas the Unfaithful" by the people. In reality, Jacques had been killed by the third assassin that Marcel had hired, who was in turn shot and killed by Callas. The mastermind then dissolved the assassin with Primordial Water, thus erasing any evidence that could have exonerated Callas, as the public did not know that Fontainians could be dissolved in Primordial Water.
Rather than standing trial at the Opera Epiclese, Callas opted to maintain his innocence by facing the Champion Duelist Clorinde. Prior to the duel, he asked her to take care of his daughter for her, which she agreed to. Callas fought to the death in the ensuing duel and perished. These events confused Navia for many years, as Callas had kept his motives a secret from her, and caused her to have a strained relationship with Clorinde.
However, with the Traveler's assistance, Navia discovered the truth—rather than defending himself in court and likely testifying against the Sinthe producers, which would have caused them to retaliate against her, Callas had chosen to die in the duel against Clorinde. Thus, for years after the incident, Marcel did not attempt to harm Navia, as this would have triggered Callas' associates to share crucial intel about the Sinthe business with the authorities.

<title>Futsu Masayoshi</title>
<text>Futsu Masayoshi ja=経津政芳 ja_rm=Futsu Masayoshi, also known by his nickname Masagomaru ja=真砂丸 ja_rm=Masagomaru, was a historical figure in Inazuma and a bladesmith of the Futsu School, best known for forging Haran Geppaku Futsu.
Profile
Futsu Masayoshi was one of the greatest swordsmiths of the Futsu School, one of the five schools in the Raiden Gokaden. He was taken in by Futsu Minori, the third-generation master, and was the sworn brother of her son Futsu Hiroyoshi. After Minori's death, Masayoshi decided to leave the school to avoid a succession crisis and became a wanderer who learned the techniques of many different bladesmithing schools.Haran Geppaku Futsu
Story
An orphan who was born mute and never learned to read or write, Masayoshi was taken in by Futsu Minori, and learned the art of swordsmithing from her. He was close with her because she had accepted him when nobody else had, while she often confided in him, joking that his muteness meant he couldn't spill any of her secrets.
Before Minori's death, her blade Hasui Geppaku Futsu, which was wielded by the Raiden Shogun's valet (possibly Chiyo), was broken in a certain fight to "decide the fate of the oni people." It was sent to be reforged, but because Minori was no longer capable of swordsmithing, Masayoshi took up the task in her stead and forged Haran Geppaku Futsu.
Because Masayoshi was a superior weaponsmith compared to Futsu Hiroyoshi, a succession crisis nearly occurred after Minori's death as a result of Masayoshi's fame following his forging of Haran. To resolve the issue, Masayoshi taught Hiroyoshi Minori's techniques and, after determining that Hiroyoshi could stand independently, left the Futsu School. He traveled around Inazuma and abroad to further his mastery of the craft. Eventually, he went on to mentor three students of the Isshin Art, another school in the Raiden Gokaden, whom he viewed as his best disciples: Kaedehara Kagemitsu, Niwa Nagamitsu, and Akame Mitsunaga.</text>

<title>Parvezravan</title>
<text>Parvezravan, originally named Kisra then renamed Kisra Parvez after his adoption by Ormazd,The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin was a historical figure in Sumeru who was best known as the second-to-last king of the ancient city-state of Gurabad. His renown in battle gave him the epithet Spirit of Victory.Transparent Ruins Record (I)
He was Liloupar's son, making him the biological younger brother of Shirin of Gurabad, whom he married. He was Shiruyeh's father, but his wariness of his son due to Liloupar's warning ultimately led to his death and Gurabad's destruction.
Story
Kisra was Liloupar's son whom she had as part of her vengeance against her lover, Ormazd.Memories of Gurabad She left Kisra to be raised by the giant divine bird Ghognus, and Kisra's ambitions and Ghognus' aid led Ormazd - the vassal-king of King Deshret and Liloupar's lover - to adopt him. Kisra's many exploits and feats, such as allegedly conquering ninety-nine other vassal states, gave him the epithet "Spirit of Victory."
To reward Kisra for his valor, Ormazd bestowed him with the name "Parvez." He also gave Kisra his daughter Shirin's hand in marriage, unaware that their fates were part of Liloupar's plan to take revenge on him. The marriage turned out to be a loveless one as Kisra saw Shirin as a means to the throne and did not truly love her. Liloupar took advantage of this to have Shirin, with Kisra as a reluctant co-conspirator, serve poisoned honey to her father and her other siblings at a banquet, causing their deaths. Shirin went insane after seeing the consequence of her actions, while Kisra took advantage of the situation to become the new king,Dune-Entombed Fecundity: Part III dubbing himself "Kisra Parvezravan."
As Vassal-King
Parvezravan desired even greater power and turned to his mother for guidance. Liloupar designed machines driven by Jinn spirits and gave them to her son, and then gave him the idea of creating a massive machine to mass produce them through a dream. The Jinn for these machines were created by Shirin, whose insanity led the Jinn to be created "mindless and malformed." These machines brought Parvezravan a vast amount of wealth and he seemingly abolished slavery for the betterment of Gurabad. However, because the slave labor was now performed by the Jinn machines, this led to increasing socioeconomic disparity as former slave owners no longer needed to sustain a human workforce and the former slaves no longer had a means to make a living.
This had all been part of Liloupar's machinations, who had fostered Parvezravan and Shirin's son, Shiruyeh. Parvezravan, having heard Liloupar's warning that his son would become even greater than himself, had always been wary of Shiruyeh and banished him from Gurabad once he reached adulthood. Forced to don a brass mask to disguise his identity, he took on the name "Khorramdin" and touted himself as the savior of the common people, as well as the emissary of Nabu Malikata. He led a rebellion against Parvezravan and eventually emerged victorious. However, his victory - brought by Liloupar, who had used the power of the "dark abyss" - caused the deaths of his followers and the inhabitants of Gurabad, and the city itself sank down into a deep chasm.The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin
Parvezravan's exact manner of death is unknown; in Liloupar's memories, he turned into a dark monster, whereas Eremite history claims he was killed in his bedchambers by Shiruyeh.
Legacy
Few people know the truth behind Gurabad's destruction, and many different interpretations of Gurabad's history exist. Parvezravan is recorded in Eremite history as both a great hero and a tyrant, Shirin is seen as a schemer who plotted Ormazd's and Parvezravan's deaths to get her vengeance at her dull and loveless life, and Shiruyeh is known as a coward who caused Gurabad's fall and unleashed Shiruyeh's Plague.

Appearance
The ship is described to be ironclad and white in colour.https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Viewpoint/Graveyard_of_Ships
Story
The Sponsian earned its name by the First Mate Nathaniel Pickman, which was originally the name of a usurper. After the ship got wrecked in a certain incident, Basil retired from her office as the Admiral of Fontaine's navy and moved on to become the vice-director of the Narzissenkreuz Institute.
When the cataclysm struck, the Sponsian would soon be repaired and set off with the crew to face the beast Elynas. During the battle against Elynas, the other ships of the Fontaine Armada would also follow the Sponsian. However, monsters from the Abyss were attracted and thus, many crew members, including the young girls and boys, were evacuated by the Second Mate.
A machine operating on the ship displayed a reading which showed zero chances of survival for the rest of the crew who remained on board, the known members left being Basil, Nathaniel and the Chief Engineer. Eventually, the crew lost to Elynas and thus, were killed. The other ships of the Fontaine Armada sunk during the battle.
One half of the Sponsian is inside Elynas' body while the other half can be found on shore as of the current game events. On the other hand, the sunken battleships that followed the Sponsian during the battle found its resting place in a trench of the Beryl Region, the place being dubbed as the "Graveyard of Ships".
Present
The Traveler and Paimon encounter the Melusine Ahes who is keen of learning about the Sponsian. Apparently, Ahes was informed by fellow melusine Verenata about the Traveler's hallucinations of seeing the Sponsian. They track down the Sponsian by using a conch. This trail then leads to the surface where the wreckage can be found. The Traveler suddenly manages to recount the experiences of Basil and even heard her voice, described to be "sorrowful".
It turns out that Ahes has gained the recognition of Basil and she trusts the melusine to take care of the wreckage. Ahes then plans ahead to restore the ship's logbook and piece together Basil's adventures.</text>

<title>Narukami Pillar</title>
<text>check for other dialogue before starting Orobashi's Legacy (is the Narukami Pillar at Fort Mumei only accessible after solving the Sacred Stone Puzzle at Fort Mumei?); verify exactly which quest has us repairing the Fort Mumei ward
The Narukami Pillars, also referred to as wards, are stone lanterns found throughout Yashiori Island created to suppress the Tatarigami that spawned after the ancient god Orobashi was slain there.Orobashi's Legacy: Prologue Recently, a radical faction within the Watatsumi Army attacked and broke the wards, believing it would restore Orobashi's power and turn the war in their favor.Interactable: Serpent's Head Waterlogged Note Waterlogged Note Instead, it unleashed the Tatarigami, causing chaos for everyone on the island.
Over the course of the World Quest series Orobashi's Legacy, the Traveler helps Kaji repair the Narukami Pillars at Fort Fujitou, Serpent's Head, Jakotsu Mine, and Fort Mumei by retrieving each Narukami Pillar's Rock Pillar Pearl and Rock Pillar Warding Stone. This abates the constant thunderstorms plaguing the island.
The pillars can be Observed before starting Orobashi's Legacy, resulting in some dialogue. When interacting with them, the option to interact with it simply says "Observe"; it changes to "Narukami Pillar" after starting the quest.
Before the wards are repaired, they emit black and purple crackles.
Fort Fujitou
This ward is restored in Orobashi's Legacy: Part I using the Musoujin Gorge: Rock Pillar Pearl and Musoujin Gorge: Rock Pillar Warding Stone. Both items are locked behind a Sacred Stone Puzzle that cannot be completed before the quest.
(Before starting Orobashi's Legacy)
Observe: The strangely-shaped stone lantern seems to be emitting an ominous energy.
Paimon: This stone lantern is so strange... It's so creepy.
Paimon: Oh, what's that written on the light post?
Observe: "Travelers passing through: if you have any questions about this ward, please go to the Musoujin Gorge and talk to Kaji Mr. Kaji about it."
Observe: The handwriting looks very recent, and there are a few lines of smaller handwriting below, which have been eroded by the rain:
Observe: "Please tell Mr. Kaji we've tried... But unfortunately... Maybe he can find it somewhere nearby..."
Observe: "Please tell Mr. Kaji to come to the refuge as soon as possible. He's dearly missed by his family."
Paimon: This Mr. Kaji seems to be pretty concerned about these stone lanterns. Why don't we go to Musoujin Gorge and ask him?
Garrison Log Fragment
Next to the ward at Fort Fujitou is a Garrison Log Fragment, recording the perspective of soldiers stationed at Fort Fujitou before and shortly after the wards were destroyed.
Garrison Log Fragment: It's sunny and the sea breeze is refreshing...
Garrison Log Fragment: ...How unfortunate, then, that we're stationed out in the middle of stinking nowhere! Apparently, the transfer was made at the request of Yae Miko Lady Yae Miko. Still, we are the samurai of the Tenryou Commission, after all, not the Grand Narukami Shrine Grand Shrine's guards! Lady Miko may have greater seniority than our Kujou Takayuki Lord Kujou, but such behavior is still quite unreasonable...
Garrison Log Fragment: ...That said, the new equipment is quite good. And this notebook is waterproof...
Garrison Log Fragment: ...
Garrison Log Fragment: ...It's cloudy today and the rain is imminent...
Garrison Log Fragment: ...The onmyouji from Narukami Island conducted a routine maintenance ceremony. Before they left, they gave us many Sakura Mochi as a gift. They're of Kamisato Clan make, I believe. Most delicious...
Garrison Log Fragment: ...Sanboushi's at that age where his teeth are growing out, isn't he? I'd really love to make some desserts for him, but I wonder if it's too late for me to learn...
Garrison Log Fragment: ...Heita said that he's discovered some abnormal movements on the western beach, and that it might be Kairagi. The Watatsumi Army Sangonomiya are so weak - how can they just let pirates run amok on the western sea? They may have been getting along well all this time, but they shouldn't be so complacent...
Garrison Log Fragment: ...
Garrison Log Fragment: ...
Garrison Log Fragment: ...Thunderstorm...
Garrison Log Fragment: ...It's been raining heavily today for some reason. There's thunder and lightning everywhere. We can hardly tell whether it is day or night...
Garrison Log Fragment: ...A faint, sad voice can be dimly heard in the thunder. Scary...
Garrison Log Fragment: Old Man Hachino said this is happening because the Ogosho is enraged. What nonsense. Inazuma is a peaceful place. What reason would the Ogosho have to be angry?
Garrison Log Fragment: ...We can't find Heita anywhere. Once this storm is over, he shall have to be punished...
Garrison Log Fragment: ...We can see strange flames amidst the rain...
Garrison Log Fragment: (The contents end here)
Serpent's Head
This ward is restored in Orobashi's Legacy: Part II using the Serpent's Head: Rock Pillar Pearl and Serpent's Head: Rock Pillar Warding Stone. The Rock Pillar Pearl is locked behind a Sacred Stone Puzzle that cannot be completed before the quest. The Rock Pillar Warding Stone is locked behind an underground puzzle and can be collected before the quest.
(Before starting Orobashi's Legacy)
Observe: The strange stone lantern seems to emit an ominous energy.
Paimon: This stone lantern is so creepy... It feels familiar.
Paimon: Oh, someone's written something on the lantern post!
Observe: "Soldiers stationed here, if you have any questions about this ward, please go to the Musoujin Gorge and talk to Kaji Mr. Kaji."
Observe: The handwriting looks new, yet eroded by rain. A few clear lines of smaller writings are below.
Observe: "Please don't believe these strange notes. We've got no time to lose! This must an enemy trick meant to slow us down."
Observe: "Whoever leaves the team without permission will be severely punished!"
Paimon: This Mr. Kaji seems to be pretty concerned about these stone lanterns. Why don't we go to Musoujin Gorge and ask him?
Waterlogged Note
Next to the Narukami Pillar is a Waterlogged Note left by a radical faction within the Watatsumi Army, revealing Nathan and the Resistance's involvement in breaking the wards on Yashiori Island.
Waterlogged Note: ...If anyone leaks the team's secrets, they shall be held accountable...
Waterlogged Note: Phase 1: Ambush the Shogunate soldiers on a rainy night using our long-studied tactics, switch outfits with them, and obtain their ship's supplies.</text>

<title>Primordial Sea</title>
<text>The Primordial Sea is a sea located under Fontaine. It once covered the entire surface of the planet and is where most life in Teyvat first originated from.When All Return to the Waters One known large passage connecting the now-underground Primordial Sea to the surface is located under the Fortress of Meropide,Cataclysm's Quickening however smaller pools of Primordial Seawater can also be found in other underground areas.
Originally, some of the Oceanids created by the first Hydro Archon Egeria longed to become human, so Egeria used the Primordial Sea's life-granting properties to give the Oceanids human forms. These Oceanids and their descendants would become the humans of Fontaine, but as their forms were derived from the Primordial Sea, coming into contact with the Primordial Sea's waters would cause them to dissolve into water and turn back into Oceanids. Egeria's creation of life without permission angered the Heavenly Principles, who declared that Egeria and the now-human Oceanids to have sinned, an "original sin" that all Fontainian humans from that point on were born with.Apocalypse The Heavenly Principles decreed a Prophecy of Fontaine prophecy stating that, one day, the water levels in Fontaine will rise and dissolve the people of Fontaine to absolve them of their sin, leaving only the Hydro Archon alive.Soloist's Prologue
Following Neuvillette's rise to full dragonhood, he regained his Dragon of Water predecessor's control over the Primordial Sea. He used it to "forgive" all Fontainians of their original sin, using the life-giving properties of the Primordial Sea to turn the Fontainians into true humans. Nowadays, the Primordial Sea is no longer a threat to Fontainians.
Overview
The pure Waters of the Primordial Sea are not capable of only creating life, but also taking it away. Fontainians who come into contact with pure Primordial Seawater will have their bodies dissolve into water, but their consciousness merged into it. However, non-Fontainians who come into contact with it will instead simply gain increased sensitivity to the Hydro element. The ancient Remurian people were aware of the Primordial Sea's life-granting and life-taking properties, and had a prophecy of their own in which the Primordial Sea would one day swallow all life, and anything which did not originate from it would be filtered out as waste.Dross of Pure Sacred Dewdrop
People who are dissolved into the Primordial Sea will have their memories merged into it, although their consciousnesses appear to be able to retain some level of individuality. This is seen in the "Oceanid" that was formed in the Fountain of Lucine from the consciousnesses of Vacher's lover Vigneire and his victims that flowed back to the Fountain alongside the Primordial Seawater used to dissolve them. According to legend, God-King Remus used golden Ichor and pure water to remove people's souls from their bodies and implant them into golems.The History of the Decline and Fall of RemuriaWhile Pulteney relegates folklore about "soul-stealing magisters who entrapped mortal spirits within specially-made magical golems" to mere legend, it is corroborated by Sublimation of Pure Sacred Dewdrop and Movement of an Ancient Chord. The former mentions that Remus used Ichor and pure water to separate souls from their bodies, while the latter claims that "To save their waning civilization and their desire to transcend, the Golden Troupe played melodies most wondrous, enticing children to offer their precious souls to the sleeping golems."
Water of the Primordial Sea can have its potency reduced by mixing it with other liquids or diluting it. God-King Remus attempted to mix insoluble Ichor with pure water, believing that memories and wisdom could be contained with it and thus allow his subjects to surpass the limitations of mortal bodies and gain eternal life; however, ordinary life cannot handle the separation of soul and body, and Remus' ambitions only served to ultimately destroy his nation.Sublimation of Pure Sacred Dewdrop In modern times, Sinthe has been manufactured by diluting Water from the Primordial Sea, which does not cause people to be dissolved into water but instead imparts them with an addicting sense of euphoria. Prolonged consumption of Sinthe causes many side effects, such as becoming unable to focus or control one's emotions, and withdrawal symptoms include flashes of paranoia and anxiety as well as severe loss of energy.The Truth, Lost With the Rain Sometime later, the Fatui diver Freminet found himself in the water near the Fortress of Meropide when the Primordial Sea began to leak into it, and he mostly just exhibited symptoms of exhaustion and suffocation suggesting that even heavily diluted it can rob a Fontaine Vision wielder of their ability to breathe underwater.
History
According to Hydro Vishap legend, in the beginning the Primordial Sea had a composition similar to that of blood, and that life within it was not individual. Life that evolved to walk on land or fly in the skies thereby formed blood vessels to keep the waters of the Primordial Sea within themselves. The Dragon of Water was said to have been the "beating heart" that controlled the Primordial Sea.
Oceanid legend further states that after the Dragon of Water was removed from its position, the Shade of Life, one of the Four Shades of the Primordial One, created a new heart for the Primordial Sea. This heart was Egeria, who would eventually become the Hydro Archon.Wings of Merciful, Wrathful Waters
In Remuria
Life that came from the primordial sea is inevitably fated to return to it. But there are infinite possibilities for humans to transcend, and even the waters of the primordial sea cannot completely dissolve them...|Boethius
Remurian legend claims that "before the birth of life, there was a dense primordial sea. It is the purest origin of all things, and one day, it will also swallow all life... and those things which did not arise from it will be filtered out, becoming naught but floating detritus."
When Remus first appeared on the Primordial Sea, the first sovereign - possibly referring to the original Dragon of WaterWine Goblet of the Pristine Sea states that Remus once visited the kingdom of dragons, while 'The History of the Decline and Fall of Remuria' says that "the great dragon beneath the abyssal depths submitted to his power." Together, this suggests that the "first sovereign" referred to in Broken Goblet of the Pristine Sea's description is one of the Seven Sovereigns. However, the original Chinese equivalent for "sovereign" in Broken Goblet's description is 主 tl=master, lord instead of the expected 王 tl=king used for the other known Sovereigns. or the Primordial OneThe Byakuyakoku Collection'The History of the Decline and Fall of Remuria' sets the earliest possible time for Remus' arrival in Fontaine during the Archon War, long after the Seven Sovereigns were defeated by the Primordial One (with the Dragon of Water perishing at an unknown point after), while the author of 'Before Sun and Moon' calls the Primordial One the "great sovereign" for its victory over the draconic Sovereigns. Once again, however, the original Chinese text for "great sovereign" is 大王 tl=great king, leaving Broken Goblet's use of "sovereign" zh=主 uncertain. - gave him a goblet of water which he later used to "refine" water from the Primordial Sea and establish Remuria.Broken Goblet of the Pristine Sea The refined substance was golden Ichor,Wine Goblet of the Pristine Sea which Remus aimed to replace the Primordial Sea with.Essence of Pure Sacred Dewdrop
Egeria's Rule
During Egeria's rule, the Oceanid subjects of hers would all go on to long for human life. They begged Egeria to grant human life to them, which Egeria used the Primordial Seawater as a replacement for human blood in order to give these Oceanids life. This action angered the Heavenly Principles, as Egeria did not have the proper authority to create human life and for using the powers of the Primordial Sea. Following this act, the now-human Oceanids would have judgment cast upon them by the Heavenly Principles, and would be tarnished with 'Original Sin'. This sin is what triggered the prophecy that Fontainians would all dissolve within the rising seawaters, in order to wash away the nation's sins.
At some point during Egeria's rule, the Fortress of Meropide was constructed by criminals seeking Egeria's forgiveness and mercy, who told them to head to the depths to protect her secret underneath the waves, which was an entrance to the Primordial Sea. The criminals covered up the entrance with a sluice gate and over time, various measuring contraptions were added to monitor the level of Primordial Water in the area. This area was restricted to only the Warden and trusted people, though it was eventually forgotten by most of the prison's inhabitants as the years passed.
Cataclysm
During the cataclysm 500 years ago, the waters of Fontaine were tainted by the power of the Abyss. Although that taint has since been diluted and cleansed, no Oceanids could naturally be born from Fontaine's waters outside of the few pure containers of water that still remain.Tainted Water-Splitting Phantasm Idyia also states that Fontaine's water suddenly became bitter with pain and hate, forcing the Oceanids who survived the cataclysm to take refuge in other sources of pure water for survival.Idyia
After Egeria died at Tunigi Hollow during the cataclysm, her body transformed into a body of water known as Amrita Pool, which can purify the power of the Abyss with the help of the Khvarena, which spread across the area after the Khvarena Simurgh merged her powers with the Amrita's. It is unclear whether the Amrita Pool's water is the same as the Primordial Sea's, but Zurvan calls the Amrita the "Primordial Amrita," and the Pari - the Khvarena created from Simurgh which have sentience - return to the Amrita over time.Zurvan
Over 400 Years Ago
The Primordial Sea became a research subject for the Narzissenkreuz Ordo. Jakob Ingold's research conclusions were later used as the basis for Marcel's research, although his exact writings have not been disclosed. At some point, the Narzissenkreuz Master would eventually descend into the Primordial Sea, waiting to be freed to bring about his own world to prevent the apocalypse he had foreseen.
Present Day
According to Neuvillette, the Primordial Sea no longer existed on Teyvat's surface. Marcel, original name Vacher, researched the properties of the Waters of the Primordial Sea in hopes of reviving his lover, Vigneire; the two had accidentally stumbled into a pool of its water while on an expedition; because Vigneire hailed from Fontaine, she dissolved into water, but was unable to tell Vacher to forget about her before she did so.
In the process, he discovered that diluting the water created an addictive drink which imparted the drinker with a sense of euphoria, marketed it as "Sinthe," and made a fortune by selling it to the people of Poisson via dealers. However, Sinthe also had drastic side effects of harming both drinkers and abstainers alike, resulting in Callas ordering a ban on the product in Poisson. He managed to convince one of the sellers, Jacques, to be his informant, though Marcel was aware of this and ordered Jacques to kill Callas, though he could not, so a third party was hired. The assassin was successful in killing Jacques, but not Callas, while Marcel had Primordial Water poured on the man to dissolve him and cement Callas as the killer. Callas was aware of this but did not do anything in order to protect his daughter Navia, as she was targeted by Marcel's organization and he would subsequently die in his duel against Clorinde.
Meanwhile, Marcel used the funds he acquired from Sinthe production to continue his research into reviving Vigneire, only to encounter failure after failure. By the time his deeds were discovered during the Fontaine Archon Quests, over 25 women had been dissolved over the course of 20 years, creating a recurring criminal case which was dubbed the "serial disappearances case". He was never considered a suspect for the previous disappearances, as he had always managed to frame someone else for it.
While Marcel was found guilty by the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale for his crimes, it likewise declared Tartaglia Childe guilty for an unknown reason, causing him to be sent to the Fortress of Meropide, but he escaped to follow the voice he kept hearing in his head. A year prior to the Traveler's arrival to Fontaine, Wriothesley noticed that the dashboards in the "forbidden zone" were increasing, though he was not certain as to the cause. The Knave Arlecchino sent Lyney, Lynette and Freminet to the prison to gather information and locate Childe. During the investigation, Freminet attempted to track Childe's route back out to a sewer opening but discovered that the ocean water at the place was diluted with Primordial Water, causing him to pass out and was saved by Clorinde, allowing Wriothesley to deduce that the readings were actually monitoring the levels of Primordial Water and that the prison was built to stop it from enveloping Fontaine. Soon after, the water encased behind burst down the sluice gate, but Wriothesley and Clorinde were able to keep it at bay long enough for Neuvillette to arrive, push the water back and implement a new seal.
Childe, who had tried to follow the voice, ended up falling unconscious. When he came to, he found himself in the depths of the Primordial Sea, along with a massive, All-Devouring Narwhal narwhal-like entity swimming in front of him. This narwhal was present in the sea for a prolonged period of time, consuming any energy it could find inside; this also caused the sea's levels to rise. The two soon entered a brawl, with Childe's actions delaying the beast long enough to prevent it from emerging in Fontaine earlier.
The water would eventually leak out from Poisson and the surrounding area, causing some people to be dissipated into water, including Melus and Silver. The narwhal, which had consumed all it could from the Primordial Sea, then emerged in the Opera Epiclese to consume Fontanians, as they had its water in them. Neuvillette, having learned the entire truth from Focalors, had his Authority restored after the latter killed herself to fulfill the Heavenly Principles' demand and knowing that Neuvillette would try to protect the people after having served as their Iudex for centuries. Neuvillette, with his Authority restored, declared their sins absolved, turning their faux blood in their bodies into real blood, effectively making them "true" humans. He then had the Traveler accompany him into the sea to kill the beast, though they only managed to subdue it before Skirk arrived and sent it back into the Abyss alongside an unconscious Tartaglia. As Skirk talked about her master and other prominent individuals, she also reminded them about the prophecy which was about to enact as the beast was now defeated with its consumed energy returning to the sea.
The Primordial Sea then engulfed Fontaine in water, but because the Fontanians were now true humans, the water did not dissolve them, though many people were left drenched in the process. The water then proceeded to recede back into the Primordial Sea, where it would cause no further problems and the people of Fontaine began recovery efforts.Masquerade of the Guilty
During another one of their adventures, the Traveler, alongside Seymour, Ann and Caterpillar, would forge the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz to stop Jakob and the Master from creating their own world. After breaking the four seals, they headed to the Tower of Ipsissimus where they encountered and defeated Jakob, who chose to die in the hopes of seeing Master's new world. The group made their way through the tower, collapsing it into the sea, which broke another seal leading to the Primordial Sea. Inside, the Traveler and Ann defeated the Master, who then realized that his world-formula was wrong and agreed to leave with them to see the current world. After they left, Ann resealed the tower to ensure that the waters would not flood into Fontaine.
Fontemer
While it is currently unclear exactly what Fontemer is, it may be related to the Primordial Sea, as Fontemer Aberrants are said to have potentially evolved from ordinary aquatic lifeforms as a result of "environmental factors specific to Fontaine."Angelic Sea Hare Fontemer is also capable of accepting and being controlled by others, who are said to be capable of receiving blessings from Xenochromatic Creatures.Hunter's Ray

<title>Talent</title>
<text>Talents are special abilities that characters possess. They are split into two types: Combat and Passive.
Most characters have three Combat Talents and three Passive Talents. Mona and Ayaka have a fourth Combat Talent in the form of an Alternate Sprint. Sangonomiya Kokomi Kokomi has four passive talents. The Traveler does not have a Utility Passive.
List of Talents
Talent/List
* Combat Talents
** Normal Attack - The main form of attack for each character.
** Elemental Skill - Does not require Energy to use but has a Cooldown period between each use.
** Alternate Sprint - Replaces the normal sprinting of a character.
** Elemental Burst - Requires Energy to use.
* Passive Talents
** 1st Ascension Passive - Usually provides an improvement to a Combat Talent.
** 4th Ascension Passive - Usually provides an improvement to a Combat Talent.
** Utility Passive - Usually provides some utility outside of combat.
Combat Talents
Combat Talents
Upon obtaining a character, all Combat Talents come unlocked at Level 1.
A Combat Talent's level can be Talent Level Increase raised mainly through the following ways:
# Using Character Talent Materials, with their current maximum Talent level determined by their Character Ascensions Ascension Phase, up to Level 10.
# Unlocking certain Constellations that raise a specific Talent's effective level by +3. Using this method also raises the Talent's Level cap from 10 to 15.
#* This does not mean that you can use Character Talent Materials to continue leveling up a character's particular talent past 13; the jump from 13 to 15 must be done by other means (like Utility Passive Talents or Event Bonuses).
# Certain characters also have Level Increase Talents Passive Talents that can raise a party's specific category of Talent Level.
Additionally, certain Events may grant special bonuses that temporarily increase a character's talent level:
* During the event Energy Amplifier, equipping the Fractured Fruit Fragment "Refined Burst" increases the Talent Level of characters' Elemental Burst in the domain, which allowed the max burst level to reach level 14 during the event.
* During the event Perilous Trail (Event) Perilous Trail, equipping the Perilous Trail (Event) Stratagems Stratagem "Superlative" increases the Talent Level of characters' Elemental Skills and Elemental Bursts in the domain, which allowed the max skill and burst level to reach level 14 during the event.
The level of Alternate Sprints cannot be raised.
Using Talents
attacking a slime. Note the arrow indicating that the slime is currently selected.]]
Each talent is used by pressing the appropriate button. By default on PC, clicking lclick will use a Normal Attack, holding Charged Attack, E Elemental Skill, Q Elemental Burst, and, if equipped, clicking rclick or pressing Shift casts an Alternate Sprint.
When near an enemy or group of enemies, an arrow () serves as an indicator for the currently selected enemy. Talents will attack the selected enemy by default. Moving to a different portion of the battlefield will move this arrow toward a different enemy. Alternatively, some attacks have the ability to be aimed or will affect an area of effect either around the character or the selected enemy, and thus allows for attacking an enemy other than the one currently selected. When no enemies are selected, talents will directly affect the area in front of the playable character.
Defense Mechanisms cannot be selected. Slime Balloons can only be selected if there are no other enemies nearby. Invisible enemies such as Dendro Slimes buried in the ground or Fatui Pyro Agents also cannot be selected.
Combat Talent Scaling
When a Talent is upgraded, its attribute values increase by a multiplier based on the Talent level:NGA:
\text{Upgraded Talent Attribute Value} = \text{Base Talent Attribute Value} \times \text{Talent Level Multiplier}
Base Talent Attribute Value is the damage/healing/shield HP value a Talent has at level 1 (e.g. Geo Traveler's Starfell Sword has 248% Skill DMG at level 1).
For Talents with both a percentage (x%) and a flat component (+x) (e.g. Let the Show Begin), the percentage value scales with the same multiplier as other Talents, but the flat value scales with a different multiplier.
Normal Attack Talents also scale with a different multiplier. The multiplier is estimated and within 1% of actual values; there may be errors are due to internal rounding and/or slight estimation errors.
Certain characters like Zhongli and Xiao have different scalings for their talents. These exceptions are discussed in the next section.

Passive Talents
Of a character's Passive Talents, only the third comes unlocked upon obtaining them. The first two are unlocked at 1st and 4th Ascension Phase. Passive talent levels cannot be upgraded.
Note that the effects provided to Combat Talents by Passive Talents will not be reflected in the information screens of Combat Talents, even if the effects are unconditional. For example, the unconditional cooldown reductions provided by Shattered Darkrock and Rekindle are not reflected in the information screens of Starfell Sword and Passion Overload, respectively.

<text>the character the Archon Quest in Chapter I: Act II Guizhong (Quest)
Guizhong zh=归终 zh_rm=Guīzhōng, also known by her Goetic name Haagentus,A Single Harmony for an Irreplaceable Soul was the God of Dust. She is best known as one of the gods who presided over the Guili Assembly, which she established alongside Morax and Marchosius, and for her mechanisms such as the Guizhong Ballista.
She perished in a battle during the Archon War, while a massive flood forced the Guili Assembly's inhabitants to move south to Liyue Harbor. Since her death, Guizhong's legacy has been preserved in historical texts.
Profile
Introduction
Teach with wisdom, be bound by virtue, fortify the bones, unite in ambition
Guizhong is the late God of Dust who was one of the rulers of the Guili Assembly. She was kind-hearted and wise but not particularly powerful, so she worked alongside the more powerful Morax to rule the Guili Assembly together. Guizhong had a particular interest in mechanics: the Guizhong Ballista was one of her handiworks, built with the aid of the adepti, and she apparently collected Khaenri'ah technology such as Ruin Machines for research.Voyage to the Sanguine Sky
After the start of the Archon War, she ultimately lost her life in a destructive battle that laid waste to Dihua Marsh and Guili Plains.Stone Tablet Compilations: Vol. I
Appearance
Guizhong took the form of a young woman with billowing sleeves.Memory of Dust
She has long, flowing gray hair that fades into a cerulean-blue. The back side is partially chopped in a bob-length fashion and the rest is tied into a rat-tail with a long dark-blue hairpin. The front is cut into neat, slightly side-swept bangs and is finished with a small dangling hair accessory.
Guizhong has long, shoulder-cut, billowing sleeves that covers her hands. The inside of the sleeves is adorned with the pattern of a starry night sky. Her outfit's color palette seems to resemble that of a Glaze Lily, as it is in many hues of white, blue, navy, and gray. There is even a Glaze Lily embroidered on each of her sleeves. The tails of her dress seem to appear to fragment at the ends, mirroring the nature of dust, being her association. She wears a blue anklet on her right foot and goes barefoot.
Guizhong typically has a face full of expression, specifically joy, in contrast to her unmoving partner Rex Lapis.
Story
Early life
It is unclear where Guizhong descended from, and the exact year, however she descended some time before the Archon War. It is said that her reach "shrouded the skies for thousands of miles around."Treasure Lost, Treasure Found (Part 1) Guizhong initially established her civilization at an unknown location in Liyue. At some point, she met Morax amid a field of Glaze Lily Glaze Lilies and presented him with a stone dumbbell now known as the Memory of Dust as a mark of their pledge, although they never made a formal contract with each other. The two became allies and Guizhong, with the help of the adepti, built the Guizhong Ballista at Tianheng Pass to autonomously defend from invaders.Guizhong (Quest) She then moved her people north of Mt. Tianheng.
Guili Assembly
Guizhong taught her people agriculture, which greatly expanded their sphere of influence. While displaying her handiwork to Morax, she dubbed the area "the Plains of the Returning and Departing" zh=归离原 zh_rm=Guīlí-yuán, or Guili Plains - deriving the name from the first character of her name, combined with a character from the name Morax used at the time. The Guili Assembly was established, co-ruled by the two gods alongside Marchosius, God of the Stove.Three to Get Ready, and Here We Go A group of people in Liyue Harbor intended to expand their city, and thus moved to Guili Plains.
During the establishment of the Guili Assembly, Guizhong established her four commandments:
'"To unite in ambition is to be steadfast and immovable for all time."'
'"Wisdom is like water, it nourishes all those who receive it and in it is a reflection of the truth."
'"Fortify the bones, that movement be supple when the time comes."'
'"Virtue grows tall like a tree, though there be shade it will flourish forever"'
At some point in time, Guizhong created the Voyage to the Sanguine Sky Realm of Clouds, located in Luhua Pool. Some unknown point later, the adepti built an abode next to it to house the evil and ancient artifacts - Ruin Machines - she collected while researching mechanics.
Cloud Retainer, Guizhong, and Morax often met up at Retainer's abode at Mt. Aocang to eat together. It is suggested that the three would each prepare a dish, which they would then eat at the table towards the middle of the pond. Guizhong's seat was on the north side, with a bowl and a pair of chopsticks on the table.Custodian of Clouds
Archon War and Death
During the Archon War, Guizhong and other adepti fought to protect the people of Guili against the many evil gods and monsters that had plagued Liyue's lands.
Guizhong lost her life in a fierce battle over Guili Plains, during which "black dust choked the heavens and a thousand rocks splintered." She died amidst the Glaze Lilies, wearing one last lonely smile as she asked Morax to forget about the stone dumbbell she gave him and bemoaned the end of their journey together. After her death, the yakshas can be seen containing the lingering energy the late deity expelled. A massive flood swept through Dihua Marsh and Guili Plains, effectively destroying the Guili Assembly.Ruins of Guili Its inhabitants, with the help of Marchosius and the adepti, traveled south for ten days, establishing what is now known as Liyue Harbor.

<title>Razor/Lore</title>
<text>Some say he is an orphan raised by wolves. Others say he is a wolf spirit in human form.He is most at home in the wild, fighting with claw and thunder.To this day the wolf boy can be found prowling the forest, where he and his wolf pack hunt to survive using nothing more than their animal instincts.
Personality
A boy who lives among the wolves in Wolvendom of Mondstadt, away from human civilization. As agile as lightning.
Razor is a generally good-natured person who considers his wolf pack his family, and becomes enraged if they are hurt by other parties. He loves his wolf family, but dislikes the fact that he isn't fully like them, being an infant taken in by the leader of his pack, Andrius. While he barely sees any fellow humans traveling in Wolvendom due to its fearsome reputation, he considers the few humans he does encounter to be his friends and is willing to protect them from danger if it means sacrificing his and his pack's dinner for the night. Razor is also a quick thinker, as he is able to fix Klee's disasters whenever she goes to play in Wolvendom.
Razor is honest and forthright, due to his limited exposure to human life. He is not used to speaking and only speaks in short phrases and words, finding it troublesome, but he continues nonetheless.
Like the rest of his wolf family, Razor enjoys eating meat and shows an aversion to most vegetables, only preferring potatoes. He gets along with Bennett well for that reason and the two typically spend most of their time talking.
Appearance
Wild Sprint
Razor uses the Medium Male Characters medium male model. He has long, spiky gray hair; bright red eyes; and pale skin. He has several scars on his body, including one on his left cheek and several on his arms, likely as a result of his time living in the wild with his wolf family.

Razor: A semi-feral boy raised by wolves who hunts among the dense forests of Wolvendom.
F-r-i-e-n-d.
▌Legend of Wolvendom · Razor
A semi-feral boy raised by wolves who hunts among the dense forests of Wolvendom.
Tales of a strange young boy are spreading in Mondstadt.
It is said that he prefers the company of wolves to men, and is a formidable hunter who prowls the forest. He has rarely been sighted, as he keeps his distance from other humans.
Some say he is an orphan raised by wolves. Others say he is a wolf spirit in human form...
As the rumours grow, so does the mystery surrounding this Wolf Boy.
All the while, Razor the Wolf Boy stands today on a mountaintop, basking in the warm sunlight, with his family — his "Lupical" — of wolves by his side.
Character Stories
Razor is a boy whose identity is shrouded in mystery. He lives in Wolvendom and is rarely spotted by the citizens of Mondstadt.According to a handful of eyewitness accounts, Razor has keen senses and is highly agile, traversing the forest at breakneck speed. He is often seen in the company of his wolf pack, while generally avoiding contact with humans.Some speculate that he was an orphan raised by the wolves, while others say he is a wolf spirit that has taken on a human form.Such rumors only add to the mystery of the "Wolf Boy," as the denizens of Mondstadt call him.Meanwhile, Razor the Wolf Boy stands all the while on the hilltops with his head held high, basking in the warm sunlight.
Razor lives among the wolves night and day.All of them are as close with Razor as they could possibly be. Which wolf has the loudest howl, which wolf runs the fastest, which wolf is the best at ambushing - there isn't a wolf Razor doesn't know.He can sense the mood of the wind, smell a scent from miles away, and knows many practical applications for plants of all kinds. The one thing he can't bring to mind is the faces of his parents.What kind of people were they? No matter how hard he tries, he cannot remember.His memory starts after his life with the wolves had already begun. The wolves took him in as part of their "Lupical" - a word he was taught by Andrius someone else, which means family.
Tiny singing things are flying in the sky.The clouds are long and fluffy, like a wolf's tail.Razor's world is a simple one.On a sunny day, you run around hunting or try and beat your prey to the ripe fruits, on a rainy day, you hide out in a hollow tree and fall asleep hugging a furry lupine friend, with some grass and leaves for a pillow.Eat as much as you can and drink plenty of water. Cool off in the lake when you're hot, and go find some juicy berries when you're thirsty.Razor looks at his body and then at the bodies of his kin.He knows he is different from them.But there's nothing wrong with that, as far as Razor is concerned.
One day, a Varka tall man came to the mountains and disrupted Razor's peaceful life.Razor did not know who the man was, only that he was a human. Seeing the confused look on Razor's face, the man gave him a friendly smile."Hey buddy! Why don't you come back down to Mondstadt with me?"The man offered his hand to Razor as he spoke.But neither Razor nor the wolves understood the gesture. Feeling protective, the wolves placed themselves between Razor and the man to keep him away.Razor ducked down beneath the wolves' furry tails. He looked at his body, and then peered out through the gaps in the wolf fur to get a look at the man's.Razor knew he wasn't the most intelligent of beings, and was at a loss to answer the question that has been in his mind ever since that day."Am I a human, or a wolf?"
It was that man who gave Razor his name.The simple Wolf Boy could not understand the intricacies of human language, but he knew from the look on the man's face when he produced this sound that the man was giving him a name."Rae-zer."The shadows cast by the trees of Wolvendom grew short, and then grew long again.The man taught Razor how to swing a sword. Unwieldy though this steel claw may be, thought Razor, it was at least sharp enough to cut through tree branches."Now you can protect your friends.""Fr-ren-dzz..."Razor imitated the sounds the man made, without understanding what they meant.Similarly, he did not understand why the names of things were all that important in the first place. After all, he never learned the name of that man before he left.
"Master, what is... 'friends'?"Razor once asked of his new mentor, working at the limits of his vocabulary.His purple-clothed mentor seemed to know it all, from how to make hash browns from potatoes in the ground, to the name of the brightest star in the summer night sky.However, Lisa simply smiled and yawned without answering him.Razor thought about it when the wind blew, when the rain fell - even when Wolfhook berries got stuck in his fur. He just couldn't figure it out.Until one day, Razor met a bright-red, 'burny' girl.They stood in the wind together, got soaked in the rain together - she even rolled around in Wolfhook bushes with him.Her name was Klee. When Razor played with her, it was like being a wolf pup again."Friends... is... Lupical."Razor may not understand the complexity of human relationships, but he has an honest, primal loyalty to him."So... protect friends... Lupical... with life."The wolf pack howls in the distance, summoning him home.Razor still does not know if he is a human or a wolf.But he is happy either way.
In a box so crudely made that one has to be extra careful when opening it lies Razor's greatest treasures.The broken-off hilt of a greatsword, a children's storybook called The Wolf and the Windwheel Aster, and a dry, withered four-leaf clover.Though he understands neither the intricacies of human relations nor the ways of the world, Razor knows that these are gifts from the ones known as 'friends' - and that is what makes them his most treasured possessions of all.
The story of how Razor got his Vision is one of the few memories that he wishes he could forget.One day, during a lightning storm, an Abyss Mage ambushed Razor from behind and dragged him away. The wolf pack ran to his aid and put up a fearless fight, but every last one of them was defeated by the Abyss Mage.As he looked on helplessly at his dear companions being harmed, Razor let out an almighty roar like that of a cornered animal."Lupical!"Fueled by his almighty fury, a lightning-like power grew inside, and suddenly an overload of elemental energy was flowing within him.He was ready to protect. He was ready to avenge.He threw off his shackles and raised his weapon.The Abyss Mage was overwhelmed and defeated by a wild, unfettered frenzy of Electro energy, but this time it was too late to save Razor's wolven companions....Though he had obtained a Vision, Razor was still unable to manipulate Electro energy with finesse. One day many moons later, when he met the Witch of Purple Rose, Lisa, he began to study human knowledge."Friends, hurt... Never again! I will... protect them."With each day, Razor grew more skilled in the use of his Vision. He made a silent promise to himself: "I will become stronger. I will become the strongest of them all."Because the day may come when his Lupical faces another threat, and this time, he will protect them.

<title>Eleazar</title>
<text>Eleazar was a chronic illness that was unique to Sumeru.Sumeru Eleazar It is a manifestation of The Withering on the human bodyLike a Triumphant Hero and is positively correlated with a person's elemental content.Eleazar Hospital Notes note=Diagnostic Report
Eleazar was eradicated upon the cleansing of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's tainted consciousness from Irminsul in the Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies, but it had no cure prior to that event.
Overview
Eleazar is a manifestation of the Withering on the human body, and commonly presents as dark, hardened scales growing on a person's body, with slight numbness in the affected area, causing clumsiness. As it advances, patients experience fatigue and progressive nerve damage, particularly as the scales develop into ulcers and eventually necrose.Eleazar Hospital Notes note=Medical Records Patients ultimately become unable to control their own bodies and are rendered immobile.Chronic Illness The afflicted may also fall into a coma as the disease progresses.
The typical conditions for the onset of Eleazar have not been detailed, but Collei and DunyarzadThe Coming of the Sabzeruz Festival were born with Eleazar, while the late Arbaaz was described as "little,"Abbas' Escape note=Unknown Person's Etchings suggesting he was rather young when he was admitted to the Eleazar Hospital.
From the Diagnostic Report of an unnamed doctor - likely Zandik, who is also heavily implied to be Il Dottore - people with Eleazar have a higher elemental content than ordinary people. While there is no true cure for Eleazar, it can be controlled by managing and reducing elemental quantities within the bodies of those affected by Eleazar. While testing his theory, the unnamed doctor found a treatment that was able to make a late-stage Eleazar patient's symptoms disappear completely.
Il Dottore and Barnabas one of his subordinates in Sumeru successfully suppressed Collei's Eleazar symptoms by infusing her with a god's remains (originally translated as 'archon residue'); however, she was not only deeply traumatized by her experiences during her treatment, but also left with an unstable power over "black fire" and experienced other "plague"-like symptoms. After Cyno sealed the god's remains inside her body, these side effects disappeared, but she was then taken to Tighnari at Gandharva Ville for care due to the reemergence of her Eleazar symptoms.
Nilotpala Lotus can be used to help those suffering from Eleazar to recover energy, and the forests of Sumeru are also effective at mitigating the effects of Eleazar,Kamran though the mechanism through which the forest alleviates the symptoms is unknown. However, the Withering has not only affected the forest, but has drastically worsened the effects felt by those afflicted by Eleazar.
History
One of the earliest occurrences of Eleazar, or symptoms that closely align with those of Eleazar, is recorded in Kasala's memories. King Deshret inadvertently brought forbidden knowledge to his people, causing darkened scales to cover people's bodies and people heard crazed whispers in their minds. The land was wrought with death and destruction and even with Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's help in erasing forbidden knowledge, King Deshret ultimately sacrificed himself to seal it away and his civilization collapsed.Secret of the Scorching Desert
Sometime in the past, Sumeru Akademiya built a hospital at Dar al-Shifa in the Great Red Sand to study Eleazar and conduct research into treatments for the disease. A certain doctor, whose name was scrubbed out of extant records, found a successful treatment utilizing an unknown material. All that is known about it is that the "Specimens" saw this treatment as "blasphemous" due to their belief that Eleazar is inflicted as divine punishment. Abbas, a 23-year-old patient at the hospital, was the lone survivor out of a group of four and managed to escape the hospital by tunneling underground. The hospital was later abandoned for undisclosed reasons, and the Akademiya has barred all access to its ruins.JuzjaniCaravan Ribat Bulletin Board Abandoned Eleazar Hospital
The Fatui, led by Il Dottore, have also undertaken research on Eleazar and its treatment through the use of gods' remains. One of Dottore's subordinates obtained test subjects by claiming the Fatui had a cure and tricking parents into giving their Eleazar-afflicted children to them. Collei's parents were among those who handed their children to the Fatui. While the Fatui performed their experiments in the desert, it is unclear whether they used the Eleazar Hospital in Dar al-Shifa, or if it was in another area of the desert; all that is known is that the facility has since become "charred ruins."
Cases of Eleazar are increasing in Sumeru City, and residents with symptoms are encouraged to go to Bimarstan for treatment.Mahamata Bulletin Board Eleazar
Following the removal of Rukkhadevata's tainted consciousness from Irminsul, all symptoms of Eleazar disappeared and afflicted patients have recovered in just a few days.

<title>Temperature</title>
<text>Climate
Temperature is a mechanic that drains HP under the right conditions. Normal temperature is encountered throughout much of Teyvat and domains.
Two separate mechanics directly relate to temperature: Sheer Cold (which appears in very cold areas, such as Dragonspine) and Blazing Heat (which appears in very hot areas, such as Narukami Island: Tenshukaku phase II).
Normal Temperatures
Normal temperatures appear in areas not affected by extreme cold or warmth. This includes areas with different climate effects, like Balethunder. In normal temperature, the character neither accumulates Sheer Cold nor Blazing Heat.
Extreme Temperatures
In extreme temperatures, such as in areas affected by Subzero Climate or in Narukami Island: Tenshukaku, players either gain the Sheer Cold or Blazing Heat gauge. This gauge normally accumulates at a rate of 1% per second. Certain conditions like swimming in cold water (for Sheer Cold) or being near cold/hot surfaces will accumulate the rate of Sheer Cold or Blazing Heat by up to 2.5%/s. In the Tenshukaku Trounce domain, getting struck by one of Signora's attacks will cause the gauge to spike by up to 10% briefly. Once either Sheer Cold or Blazing Heat reaches its limit, players will lose 1% max HP + 150 HP per second. Visibility is also greatly reduced by an icy or fiery effect over the camera until the status is cleared.
When Sheer Cold/Blazing Heat starts, the sound of an ice shard or the sound of a fire plays at the beginning alongside three beeps. After reaching ~70%, the gauge beeps once every two seconds until the gauge fills up. The gauge border then glows a solid red color, the edges of the camera are filled with ice or fire, a freezing or burning sound plays, and the player starts to lose HP.
It is not known if Sheer Cold and Blazing Heat are polar opposites, but during Narukami Island: Tenshukaku, Sheer Cold clears almost immediately after the Blazing Heat effect starts.
Leaving an area with extreme temperatures will not reset the gauge; rather, it will cause it to drain more slowly until the gauge is cleared. However, teleporting between discontinuous areas with extreme temperatures will cause the gauge to reset.</text>

<title>Jakob</title>
<text>Jakob Ingold, born Jakob Baker,Fleuve Cendre Ferryman is a Fontaine Fontainian figure who was born over 500 years ago and remained alive in the present day as a "neohuman" who has successfully adjusted to the Abyss' power. Jakob and his adoptive older brother, Rene de Petrichor, are the founders of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, a radical organization which has turned to using the Abyss' power to overcome or transcend the predicted flood which will destroy all of Teyvat.
Jakob has history with many of the other notable factions before and after the Cataclysm, such as Fleuve Cendre, the Narzissenkreuz Institute, and the Institute of Natural Philosophy. His research into the Waters of the Primordial Sea, and specifically its ability to dissolve Fontainians while incorporating their memories, became a plot point during the first two Acts of Fontaine's Archon Quest Chapter.
Profile
Jakob is closely related to many major Fontainian figures before and after the cataclysm 500 years ago, and is one of the main characters of Fontaine's post-cataclysm story. Jakob was the son of Fleuve Cendre vigilante Eduardo Baker, and was later raised in the Narzissenkreuz Institute alongside Rene de Petrichor, Alain Guillotin Alain, and Mary-Ann after the Siege of Poisson separated him from his father.
When the cataclysm struck, Jakob and Rene were sent to live with Karl Ingold,Veteran's VisageInteractable: Institute of Natural Philosophy Ancient Notes Ancient Notes who took them on an expedition to the Girdle of the Sands in Sumeru after the cataclysm ended. Jakob, who was born with a weak constitution, fell into a coma and Rene secretly used the power of the Abyss to save his life. He miraculously adapted to the Abyss' power,Rene's Investigation Notes becoming the first successful example of what Rene later dubbed a "neohuman." Believing Jakob's transformation held the key to preserving humanity in the wake of the end of the world as they had foreseen it, the two decided to gather data by joining the Institute of Natural Philosophy.
Although initially overjoyed over reuniting with Alain and Mary-Ann and being assigned to Alain's project, the two found that Alain did not trust anything he did not personally verify, souring their relationship with him.Interactable: Ancient Log Ancient Log  1 Ancient Log  1Enigmatic Page (IV) This relationship further broke down following their disastrous attempt to save the life of Alain's assistant, Carter Scherbius, who was dying from illness. After this event, the two instead doubled down on expanding the influence of their secret society, the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, to continue towards their original goal of stopping the apocalypse. Their increasingly radical research led to Rene's near-death by dissolution and the severing of ties by Mary-Ann, who had up to that point still kept in touch with Jakob. In his desperation to save Rene, Jakob was the one who constructed the base form of the Master Narzissenkreuz.Interactable: ??? Log Log The Ordo's further activities caught the attention of the Marechaussee Hunters, and the Court of Fontaine decided to shut the society down. A fateful battle broke out when — on Narzissenkreuz' orders — Jakob and several other Ordo members were sent to Elynas' remains and were confronted by Mary-Ann, her mechanical steward Seymour, and Alain. Mary-Ann went missing after the battle, while Seymour was critically damaged. Jakob survived and remains active in the present day.Limner, Dreamer, and Robotic DogEnigmatic Page (V)
Documents from the post-cataclysm era, particularly Rene's, emphasize Jakob's youth and predisposition for crying - he frequently cried at the Narzissenkreuz Institute, in secret during the expedition in Sumeru, when Alain refused to believe their findings or help them, while killing Riftwolves using his newfound power, as a neohuman, and whenever he laid eyes on Carter following their failed experimentation. He also grew emotional at the prospect of having to fight Alain and Mary-Ann. However, Jakob also possessed a talent for designing ceremonies and rituals to sway the Ordo's followers,Enigmatic Page (IX) and was willing to take larger risks for the sake of his goals. At one point, Rene briefly pondered if Jakob was not really himself anymore after being integrated with the Abyss, but never continued with that train of thought. Regardless, Jakob remained loyal to Rene throughout their project. His leadership of the Ordo during Rene's near-death following a failed experiment hardened his personality: Jakob became used to deception, projecting confidence to outsiders, and became willing to do anything to succeed, including experimenting on his own followers.
In the present day, he tricks Irus and her lackeys into working for him for free, easily gains Mamere's trust (although this is also due to her naivete regarding humans), and appears completely unapologetic about ransacking Mamere's house for Elynas' blood. His methods lead Paimon to compare him to the Abyss Order, although he quickly dissociates himself from them and calls them "benighted primitives" who are no different from "those oppressors" in trying to use a power that only a few can use. Ann, who holds some of Mary-Ann's memories, attributes Jakob's change in personality to Rene's influence, adding that "Rene changed too."The Narzissenkreuz Adventure</text>

Story
Collaboration with the Tanit
Around the time the Fatui contacted the Tanit regarding a collaboration to find a way into the Eternal Oasis, Jeht arrived in search of her father Jebrael's original tribe following the events of Golden Slumber. With her help, Babel eliminated most of the other Tanit elders and consolidated power for herself, a move which the Fatui observed with ambivalence. Zoya Snezhevna was wary of Babel's actions, particularly as Fatui scouts began disappearing, while Froderock's investigations into the Tanit revealed that they were better-educated than the desertfolk were usually assumed to be.
Later, Babel pressured the Fatui into either accepting her new terms or leaving the desert empty-handed, under the threat of cutting off their supplies should they refuse her offer. The Fatui turned their attention from the Eternal Oasis to the Tanit, but it was too late; they were unable to rendezvous with each other and could pose little threat to the Tanit. Froderock, meanwhile, demanded "live specimens" for his unknown research, so his subordinates sought a way to capture a Tanit member for him.
Demise of the Desert Expedition Team
After the Traveler assists the Tanit in uncovering the Eternal Oasis - the Orchard of Pairidaeza, the grave for Nabu Malikata whom the Tanit worshipped - and the Jinni Liloupar disappears into the ruins of Gurabad, Babel deems them too dangerous for her liking. She decides to pit them against each other, hoping that one would eliminate the other and wear themselves out for her assassins, Nayram and Rezki, to easily kill.For Her Judgment Reaches to the Skies...
As the first part of her plan, Babel tells Jeht that the Traveler was spotted making deals with the Fatui at a certain location. However, the marked location was actually a pre-arranged Fatui ambush - Babel negotiated with them for Froderock's live sample, claiming she was willing to lure a "traitor to the tribe" to them. While Zoya was dissatisfied with this arrangement and had no interest in having to deal with the Tanit's internal squabbles, the Fatui had no choice but to take Babel up on her offer. The initial capture goes off without a hitch, and Froderock expresses his excitement about Jeht's health.Make Bright the Arrows, Gather the Shields...
While preparing to move Jeht back to Snezhnaya, the Fatui soldiers accompanying her are caught by surprise when an enraged Jeht breaks through the cage and tears Jophery, the soldier closest to her, into "confetti" using only her bare hands. As she rampaged, the soldiers only barely gathered their wits enough to empty all their paralyzing Electro rounds into her, which even then only managed to render her unconscious. With Jeht's vital signs fluctuating, Ruslan left to find Froderock so he could make her "freshen up again."
This proves to be the Desert Expedition Team's destruction. By the time the Traveler finds her, Jeht is slaughtering the Fatui in a blind fury. One Fatui Skirmisher fleeing the scene remarks, "Wait... Where is Professor Froderock? He hasn't escaped!?", which another Skirmisher following him responds with "In the cave... It's everywhere! It's everywhere!"Compare the original Chinese response, which does not specify a subject but is implied to relate back to the previous subject - namely, Froderock: "Inside the cave... [It/he's] all over the place, all over the place!" zh=在山洞里...遍地都是，遍地都是！ Neither Froderock nor the expedition are mentioned again after that, so it is highly likely that Froderock was killed in Jeht's rampage.

Story
History
Kanna Kapatcir was an entity that lived long ago. Her age is not known, but she was given a name by "her," although she had forgotten both it and the person who gave her the name.
Thousands of years ago, Kapatcir noticed that some "strange objects" fell from the Celestia heavens and landed upon Tsurumi Island, producing the fog. However, she ignored the fog, even though she had the power to disperse it.The Traveler felt Kapatcir's memories and emotional fragments after touching the "feather" in The Sun-Wheel and Mt. Kanna quest. Afterwards, an Thunderbird Civilization ancient tribe living on Tsurumi Island worshipped Kapatcir. Simultaneously fearful of her and thankful for her blessings, they chose shamans to offer blood sacrifices for protection and blessings. They would also interpret any of her actions as divine revelations and used an amethyst hourglass to predict her arrival and hold a festival when she arrived. The tribe believed that she placed a dense fog to "protect" them from the "sea of darkness" outside the island.
However, she paid no attention to them, seeing them as no different from animals and living a short life. One day a young boy's song broke through the clouds and captivated her. She landed next to the boy and the two talked briefly. The boy introduced himself as Ruu and decided to give her the name "Kanna Kapatcir Great Eagle of the Storm". Ruu promised to sing to Kapatcir again and they departed.
Unfortunately, when Kapatcir returned, she saw the boy dead and his blood within the Omen of Thunderstorm sacrificial cup. While Ruu thought that his sacrifice was for the good of the tribe, she only saw the murder of an innocent and the breaking of a promise. Driven mad from rage and sorrow, she razed the entire mountain with lightning, killing everyone in the tribe to avenge the boy. She left the mountain but placed a curse on the land that would only be lifted when she could hear his song once more.Thundering Fury
Death
Years later, Kapatcir was hunted down as a monster and killed by Ei for being "an obstacle to progress," possibly meaning that she was a danger to her people at Seirai Island.

A thousand years later, Asase Hibiki released the barrier, unleashing the Thunder Manifestation upon the Raiden Shogun's ships, unintentionally destroying and fragmenting the island and sweeping Miitoboru some ships far out to sea, with a particular Ako Domeki fleet becoming stranding at the remote Golden Apple Archipelago. Another Thunder Manifestation appeared in the hollow of Mt. Kanna, born from Kapatcir's rage, after the Traveler and Paimon brought Ruu back to the location where he was sacrificed. However, now knowing the truth, Ruu went to Seirai Island and sung to the Thunder Manifestation. With the promise they made now fulfilled, another feather manifested in front of Ruu, a sign that even in death, Kapatcir had heard his song once more and lifted the curse on the island.</text>

<title>Oceanid</title>
<text>the species the Normal Boss Rhodeia of Loch
The Oceanids, occasionally called the Lochfolk, are a species made of pure Hydro energy originating from Fontaine. They are able to control water and mimic real life forms with water.
Overview
The Oceanids originate from Fontaine and are devotees of Egeria, the previous Hydro Archon. According to the Ancient Natural History Excerpts in the Institute of Natural Philosophy, legends say that Egeria shed the "first tear", which gave birth to the first Oceanid, from which all other Oceanids were born.Interactable: Institute of Natural Philosophy Ancient Natural History Excerpts Ancient Natural History Excerpts She tasked the Oceanids with spreading all over Teyvat as spies, not out of any malicious intent, but rather as a way to connect everyone similar to how water is connected throughout the continent. Some of these Oceanids saw human life and envied them, asking Egeria to grant them the ability to do so. Egeria did so by siphoning water from the Primordial Sea and injecting it into the Oceanids' blood vessels, creating humanoid forms for them. This act was seen as a "sin" by the Heavenly Principles, who decreed a Prophecy of Fontaine prophecy that the people of Fontaine would dissolve into water and leave the Hydro Archon weeping on the throne by herself.
At some point after Egeria's death during the cataclysm, the Oceanids fled Fontaine. According to Idyia, they did so because the waters changed and became full of pain and hatred.Idyia However, Rhodeia implies that some, like her, left because they didn't want to accept Focalors as the new Hydro Archon and wanted to "keep the dreams of yesteryear alive".Life Flows On (II) The coming and death of Elynas (NPC) Elynas was specified to taint Fontaine's lands and waters, and although Fontaine researchers promised that the pollution had been cleansed, this factor may contribute to the current status of Fontaine's waters.Enigmatic Page (II)
During their self-imposed exile, the Oceanids came to Tunigi Hollow in search of their master. However, after seeing that the Harvisptokhm was not what they had hoped to find, they scattered in different directions. People followed their pilgrimage trail, eventually establishing the Purification Spring domain.
The descendants of the transformed Oceanids were later absolved of sin and made "true humans" by the Dragon of Water, Neuvillette, after his Authority was restored when Focalors executed herself through the death sentence rendered by the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale and thus destroying the Hydro Archon's divine authority and heavenly throne; people caught in the waters after his verdict were not dissipated into water, however, the people dissolved prior to this did not return.
Powers and Abilities
Oceanids are able to float through the air, and are capable of achieving significant speeds. In combat they manipulate water, both to fire a variety of Hydro attacks and to create Hydro Mimic creatures formed out of water. As seen with Idyia and Callirhoe, they can also mimic a human form, though they will be afflicted with Hydro under Elemental Sight. Particularly powerful Oceanids who possess both wisdom and compassion are able to create Oceanid manifestations which can replicate other humans, much like Idyia did with her past human companions in the Veluriyam Mirage.Back to Normal: The Story Hidden in the BottleWorld Quest, In the Wake of Narcissus: Act I - 'Search in the Algae Sea'
An Oceanid's growth is very different from other creatures'. Separating from the others and departing from their homeland apparently causes them to lose much of their intelligence and ability, though they can restore it over time.Heart of Clear Springs Oceanids learn and gain intelligence mainly by joining with water sources, such as bodies of water, or even tears. One of the most potent sources is the water creatures created by another Oceanid. They can also gain some intelligence by looking upon the moon's reflection in the water.
The secret to Oceanid reproduction is only known to Oceanids. However, according to the Ancient Natural History Excerpts, Oceanids must first approach the Hydro Archon or an elder for permission to claim the "Helixsplit," which allows them to split into little Oceanids. The exact nature of what the Helixsplit is remains unknown to humans. Caterpillar speculates that Oceanid reproduction is accomplished through imagination and mimicry—when an Oceanid "imagines the path that could have been taken," a new Oceanid may be born. This appears to be the case with Ann, who was born when the merged consciousness of the Oceanid Lyris and Mary-Ann Mary-Ann Guillotin dreamed of living forever in a simple, fairytale-like world.
Oceanids are also capable of merging with each other and becoming a single, more powerful Oceanid. Most Oceanids seem to see this as something positive or normal, though some like Ann are upset by it. However, they must still be careful as it is supposedly possible for an Oceanid's mind to be shattered if they join with a smaller but wicked mind.
Oceanids are born from the water's essence.Heart of Clear Springs They can control and manipulate water, but they are also affected by changes in the water. For example, Rhodeia's enmity towards Endora turned the water connected to her pool bitter, which nearly killed the younger Oceanid. Endora was able to recover by taking in the sweet water from Springvale's spring, which was home to a Spring Fairy friendlier Oceanid.Life Flows On (I)

<title>Twinning Isle/1.6</title>
<text>Twinning Isle in the Golden Apple Archipelago 1.6 Golden Apple Archipelago during Version 1.6 and the Midsummer Island Adventure event.
Part 1
There is another Echoing Tales Story Echoing Conch on the island with the Teleport Waypoint. There is also a Rock Pile concealing a chest.
Part 2
Main Island
The main island will refer to the one with the Teleport Waypoint.
In a cave beneath the Teleport Waypoint, after breaking a Rock Pile, one can collect the Illegible Notes as part of the quest A Trip Through Fog and Wind. There is also an Echoing Conch here (Moon and Wind).
There is a Bloatty Floatty slightly above this point.
At the northwest point of the island, there is a locked chest guarded by two Pyro Whopperflowers. There is also another Echoing Conch (Wisdom of the Ancients) hidden in a giant sea conch with a hilichurl.
Near the Waverider Waypoint at the west end of the island, a Mitachurl will be guarding another chest.
At the north, there is a small island with some hilichurls and a Cryo Abyss Mage guarding a chest. There is also a Windmill Mechanism that can create a Wind Current that can be used to reach the top of the island.
At the east end of the island there are some Hymnal Rings. Move the Electro ring up, adjust the Anemo hymnal ring on the ground to position 1, and adjust the Anemo hymnal ring on the slope to position 2.
South Island
The south island is the large island directly south of the main island.
There is a Hymnal Ring challenge involving aiming the harpastum at the right angle to get it through the Pyro ring and hit the target. There is another Hymnal Ring challenge along the beach that involves aligning the Anemo hymnal rings in the right direction and adjusting the Electro ring to position 1.
After climbing some vines, one can access an Echoing Conch (Incoming Tide).
On the island there is a mural the player can take a Photo Mode photo of to obtain the Twinning Isle Mural.
Southeast Islands
Directly east of the South Island is a small island. At the top there is 1 Echoing Conch (Two Paths Through the Lonely Forest) and some harpastum minigames.
Further east is another island with 1 Echoing Conch (Five Mountains Hide the Little Village) on the ground level.
To the south is an island with 1 Waverider Waypoint and some Dendro Slimes guarding a chest.
Further south is another island where one can find the Slightly Damaged Wooden Plank as part of the From Outer Lands quest. On this island there will also be 1 Waverider Waypoint and a Hymnal Rings challenge (reposition one of the rings to point left towards the target) as well as an Echoing Conch (The Trapped). After Act III one can find one more Echoing Conch (Seaside Reminiscence).
Northeast Islands
Northeast of the main island is a small rock with a cave. In the cave there is a Stonehide Lawachurl and some Rock-Shield Hilichurls. There is also a chest in the cave. On top of the island is 1 Echoing Conch (Sail and Escape).
Nameless Islet
Starting from the Northeast Island, there will be a whirlpool nearby. From there, one can follow the wind lines to reach an islet even further northeast.
As described in A Trip Through Fog and Wind, between 10:00 – 14:00 it will be possible to pierce through the sea fog by following the wind lines. Upon reaching the islet, one can obtain the Nameless Islet Mural via Photo Mode. There will also be 5 chests on the islet.
Central Platform
This will appear in Stage 2 of the map. It is located southwest of the main island and features a large stage with a Maguu Kenki at the center. There are 3 Echoing Conches here.
After completing Dodo-King of the Sea: Lying in Wait, the third Echoing Conch (Wolf's Predicament) can be collected. Moreover, the player will be able to challenge the Maguu Kenki to a boss fight. In addition, the weather of most of the island changes to resemble Climate Sea Fog Sea Fog conditions if there is a Maguu Kenki in the arena. Razor and Barbara could also be found near the teleport point on this isle platform until the end of Midsummer Island Adventure.</text>

Profile
Under Irmin's reign, Khaenri'ah began creating machinery using "secrets from beyond the skies," which was likely related to forbidden knowledge. While this allowed them to create vastly enhanced machines which were no longer bound to this world's laws, some Khaenri'ahns distrusted such methods,Interactable: Gavireh Lajavard Someone's Abandoned Letter Someone's Abandoned Letter but they failed to persuade Irmin to stop using it.Mocking Mask

Appearance
Little is known about Irmin's physical features besides the fact that he only had one eye.
Story
At some point before the cataclysm began, he approved using "secrets from beyond the skies" - likely related to forbidden knowledge - to enhance Khaenri'ah's machinery and allow their machines to "throw off the shackles imposed by this world's laws." An unknown writer left a letter to the Knight Marshal, Anfortas, imploring that Anfortas petition the king so some of Khaenri'ah's old machinery, created before the usage of otherworldly knowledge, would be preserved for future generations. It is unknown whether anything came out of this request. Pierro's memories about his failures to gain Irmin's favor or prevent Irmin and the sages from "tearing away the veil of sin" suggest that Irmin did not heed forbidden knowledge's detractors.
Irmin's status during the cataclysm is unclear. A bulletin left behind in the underground Khaenri'ahn ruins at Gavireh Lajavard announced that Anfortas had declared himself Regent as a result of "King Irmin's present indisposed state and the current unknown threats facing the Kingdom." This suggests that Irmin was already incapable of ruling by the time the Abyssal monsters attacked Khaenri'ah.
Legacy
Kaeya secretly kept a piece of paper regarding the Alberich Clan's family history, which taught that "it was the Alberich Clan, who did not have royal blood, who stepped in as regents when the strength of the one-eyed king Irmin failed."</text>

<title>Saleb Dowleh</title>
<text>King Saleb Dowleh, originally known as Goudarz, is a mentioned character involved in the history of Sumeru as a ruler during the era of the city-states of the Great Red Sand.Sumeru History Saleb claimed to have become king with the patronage and support of King Deshret and made efforts to venerate Deshret during his reign.
Profile
Before his rise as king, Goudarz is known to have fought against rebels at Tulaytullah who were allied with a "false" Khagan. Supposedly, Goudarz's forces fought the rebels for three days with no clear end in sight. However, on the third day, a mirage appeared which helped Goudarz "repel" the rebels (who were branded as traitors afterwards).Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, Primal Obelisk Mausoleum of King Deshret, East Mausoleum of King Deshret, East
In the aftermath, an unspecified person or group who lived in Gurabad heard about the rebels' defeat and fled to avoid pursuit from an elder brother; at the same time, Goudarz is recorded as heading to Gurabad in triumph. This unknown person is possibly Goudarz' younger brother, whom Goudarz allied with again near the end of his life.Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, Primal Obelisk Mausoleum of King Deshret, West (Underground) Mausoleum of King Deshret, West (Underground)
Goudarz proceeded to re-establish Gurabad as the capital city of the desert,Gurabad had earlier been the "mortals' ideal kingdom" under Ormazd and Parvezravan, acting as the capital until it was destroyed by Liloupar's machinations. It became the capital again under Shah Ramshahr (who claimed to be the "rightful heir" following Shiruyeh) and his successor Garshāsp, who is recorded as abandoning Gurabad to make a different city the capital. inviting the people of the Cities of the Seven Towers (a list including Ay-Khanoum, Saleh, and Tulaytullah) to return there. He changed his name and was declared as King Saleb Dowleh. It is claimed that Al-Ahmar appeared before Saleb Dowleh and gifted him with an "illusion," legitimizing his reign. Saleb Dowleh, in turn, is recorded as declaring the construction of widespread public works, including many statues of Al-Ahmar.Towers of Betrayal note=The "Towers of Betrayal" are remembered as being built around the time of King Deshret's death. There is no confirmation that they correspond with the seven towers,The claim of King Deshret's appearance was possibly a political lie. King Deshret had likely already died at that time, as suggested by the inscription on the Primal Obelisk Mausoleum of King Deshret, East (Underground) Primal Obelisk in The Mausoleum of King Deshret, East (Underground), which states that Deshret would not have allowed the disorder caused by Shah Ramshahr's reign if he were "yet here." Given that Ramshahr claimed to be the rightful heir of Shiruyeh over Gurabad and took credit for creating the towers which the "Cities of the Seven Towers" were named for, Goudarz's reign presumably came after Ramshahr and Garshāsp.
There followed ten years of peace under Saleb's rule, which became known as the era of "fine rain at sunset." At some point during those years, Saleb Dowleh made an alliance with the Dharma Forest port city of Orghana (now known as Port Ormos). Orghana promised to stop raiding Saleb's lands, and Saleb in return ceased to pillage the lands and people of Orghana.
The years of "fine rain at sunset" ended with the death of Saleb's son, Prince Hojir, who died suddenly after drinking poisoned wine. In mourning, Saleb Dowleh ordered that one thousand slaves would be buried with Hojir, while one hundred nobles were also recorded as drinking the wine while "overborne with grief," causing their own deaths as well. Saleb Dowleh was accused of orchestrating these events and thus being guilty of filicide. In the resulting power vacuum, the king's brothers, heirs, and nephews turned against each other and fought over the throne.
Seeking support, Saleb Dowleh summoned Muzaffar, a Dey from Orghana with whom he had declared an alliance. However, instead of providing support, Muzaffar Dey pillaged and killed his way to Gurabad,Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, Primal Obelisk Mausoleum of King Deshret, North Mausoleum of King Deshret, North causing Saleb to ally "once more" with his younger brother. They were defeated by Muzaffar Dey, who attributed his victory to the infighting between Saleb's family. Muzaffar Dey forced Saleb Dowleh to watch Gurabad burn before executing him and his entire family. Instead of returning to Orghana, Muzaffar Dey decided to take reign and build his city in the desert, while leaving Gurabad abandoned once more.
The fate of Saleb Dowleh led Muzaffar Dey to instruct his son Zumurud to have many heirs (99 sons and daughters) to avoid the power vacuum scenario which ended up deposing Saleb.Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, Primal Obelisk Valley of Dahri Valley of Dahri

<title>Navia/Lore</title>
<text>The ever-beaming President of the Spina di Rosula, devoted to helping the people of Fontaine solve all kinds of thorny issues.
Personality
The current President of Spina di Rosula, who is lovely, dutiful, and a great boss.
As the head of the Spina di Rosula, Navia is devoted to helping people of Fontaine, being likened as a "big sister" who checks in on everyone. She has a sharp mind and knack for investigating, being able to analyze events from different angles and find answers that other parties may miss.Lies Cast Shadows Under Gathered Lights
Due to the struggles Navia had while growing up, she sometimes struggles to comprehend her own existence and wonders if she did anything meaningful. Despite having lost many loved ones throughout the years, particularly her parents Callas and Clementine, along with her trusted subordinates Melus and Silver, Navia still pushes on for a brighter future, not wanting their sacrifices to be in vain.
She had a good relationship with Clorinde in her youth, but following Clorinde killing her father in a duel, their relationship has been strained as she finds it hard to forgive her even after understanding his sacrifice. However, after solving the "young women disappearance case" with the Traveler and Paimon, Navia and Clorinde have started to talk and meet up with each other again to reconcile their relationship.
Outside of investigating, Navia enjoys baking, particularly macarons.
Appearance
Yellow Velvet Salon
Navia uses the Tall Female Characters tall female model. She has fair skin, blue eyes and long, waist-length blonde hair.
Official Introduction
Navia: The Soaring Yellow Rose
When we were young, we used to play a kind of tabletop game where she would be the adventurer and I the host. Playing things by ear has always come naturally to me — but all the same, I was often stumped by her decisions and the ripostes she came out with. But then again, that's what made it so interesting.
Judging from her appearance, there's no doubt that Navia is the very picture of a Fontainian lady.
She likes to accoutre herself in ornate dresses and fine hats, and carries with her a ribboned umbrella encrusted with jewels.
Thus bedecked, she flits around the streets of the Court of Fontaine, the slopes of Mont Automnequi, as well as lesser-known spots along the Fleuve Cendre.
She's never before been hindered by her long flowing dress, nor by her deceptively heavy umbrella. Spry as a sparrow, she is the bearer of glad tidings from the Spina di Rosula for those in need.
Perhaps this is why Navia has become one of the famous reporter Charlotte's favorite subjects.
At the exhibition hall of The Steambird, there even hangs a photo connected to her called "The Soaring Yellow Rose."
But there's no need to worry - for it goes without saying that the photo's subject not only consented to its showing, but also gave her enthusiastic support.
Character Stories
Fontaine's laws are very strict, but its people are quite free-spirited. Fontainian society contains all manner of social organizations, clubs, or factions, all of which have their own origins, development, goals, and style.For example, the short-lived Hat Jellyfish Association ostensibly promoted the protection of the waters and those living within, but was in truth founded by a band of explosives enthusiasts.By comparison, the Spina di Rosula are a law-abiding, reliable lot, their overly rambunctious young President notwithstanding.In official statements, the Spina proclaims itself to be a citizen-oriented society that involves many walks of life and focuses its efforts on solving difficult issues amongst the common folk, and that it will cooperate with the Fontainian authorities where needed.If you ask Navia, she'd tell you that the Spina serves as a business partner with all sorts of people in it, that will help with any problem, using the velvet glove or the iron fist as appropriate.Neither of these descriptions are mistaken, at least in broad strokes, so you may choose the one you prefer - though it is worth noting that those who choose the latter wording will find it easier to make friends with Navia.
In Fontaine, to say that you grew up watching the theater is no different from claiming that you were raised drinking water: Simply so ordinary that it barely bears mentioning.So it was with Navia. So enamored was she with the scenes on stage that as a little girl she would pester her Callas father to buy her tickets so that she could experience each part of the tale alongside the characters.These feelings would take on a different note after she became involved in the affairs of the Spina di Rosula. The staged conflicts seemed fewer than the twists and turns at the negotiating table, and she could see the cosmetic scars imagined by makeup artists permanently carved into the bodies of those dwelling in the Fleuve Cendre.Gradually, her visits to the opera house became less and less frequent, and she instead spent more and more time on those around her. Tragedy onstage was captivating, of course, but Navia did not wish for such tales of misfortune to befall real people.How might one mediate between separated lovers mired in the battlefields of differing perspectives? How might one in middle age robbed of their ability to work by an accident find a new way to be the breadwinner?The world is filled with problems of this sort, and while they bring little profit when resolved, unlike the core businesses that sustain the Spina, Navia throws herself into solving them.And if anyone should accuse her of being a busybody, she will counter thusly."Such presumption, to call such matters trivial," she'd say, using lofty language to stymie the other party's reply. "This is called 'a stitch in time saving nine.' And wouldn't you agree that we're doing the Palais Mermonia a favor by preventing someone from being hauled up onstage at the opera house?"At such times, Navia will not identify herself as the Demoiselle, President, or any fancy title, but as simply as Navia, an enthusiastically civic-minded citizen.
Navia, presently the one helping people out of trouble, used to be the one getting into it as a child.President Callas, busy as he was, had to rely on Spina di Rosula members to take care of her, which was no mean feat when their charge could disappear in the blink of an eye. After much searching, they would at most find the barest hint of a fancy hat's rim visible on some rooftop... only for them to find naught but the hat itself upon finally climbing up.The hat's owner would at that time already be playing somewhere on Mont Automnequi. Her curiosity was so intense that she could easily enjoy and entertain herself even without any companions. Give her a pond, and she could stare at it the whole day, watching birds flapping about as they bathed in the shallows and otters rising from the bottom to do the backstroke. Just this alone could bring her great joy for quite some time, and she would give gifts in gratitude for those who brought her such happiness - millet for the birds to eat, and shells for the otters to play with.Sometimes, she would also seek out playmates. The children of Fleuve Cendre owned no toys for the most part, so she would play hide-and-seek with them, dragging her silk skirts with her through the pipes. Win or lose, she would always gain a little extra compared to the other kids. She would emerge from her hiding place brandishing a component or two she found in some nook or cranny, a few lost Mora, or a fifty-percent new portable toolbox, and bask in the admiration of her companions.Though she would often run off on her own, most of the adults were exceptionally tolerant of her behavior (her father being the exception). Spina members would help bandage her bruised knees, and the women of the Fleuve Cendre would help mend her torn clothes. Navia would think, Ah, I am loved by so many, and such thoughts would make her happier still.At one point, Navia heard an elderly lady next door say gossipingly thusly with others: "...That girl only has her father, and he's got no time to accompany her... Poor girl, always having to roam outside by herself..."Such words made Navia unhappy for a while. She thought herself quite fortunate. Her father loved her lots, and the adults and children around her also liked her. So why would someone regard her as one to be pitied? Perhaps, Navia thought, it was a matter of unclear communication leading to confusion. In which case, that wouldn't do, not at all.From then on, whenever little Navia felt loved, she would loudly declare: "Thanks for liking me so much. That makes me very happy!"
Navia's original intention behind combining a gun with an umbrella was quite simple: she just didn't want to carry too much around, as this would affect her ability to conduct other business.It rains often in Fontaine, and the rain gives way to merciless sun, so umbrellas are a must when going outdoors. And it would not do for the Demoiselle of the Spina to go without a gun, for surely none would think it an ornament in her hands.Her sharpshooting skills are born of much practice, with her principle being that any stance will do so long as you hit your shots - even propping your barrel atop a Blubberbeast is fine.Clorinde, trained in the art of Marechaussee Hunter marksmanship, tends to shake her head at this, even as words of affirmation tumble out of her mouth. "I find your optimism regarding battle is quite admirable."Navia takes that as praise. She met Clorinde when she was a (self-proclaimed) big girl of something over ten years, and is thus quite used to the latter's mannerisms. Yes, those are accurate words of praise, indeed!Optimism is indeed a rare psychological quality not to be undervalued. Many are those who intentionally seek to cultivate such a characteristic, yet prove unable to smile amidst life's struggles, while Navia appears to have been born with this ability. To her, there are only two types of trouble in this world: The solvable, and the unsolvable. Immediate action is the panacea to problems that can be eliminated, and as for those problems beyond one's power to change, then change yourself and learn acceptance.Apart from optimism, Navia finds tolerance to be a value that brings real improvement to one's quality of life, and it is a virtue that extends to the Spina. Why, look at all the varied business ventures, and the people of all sorts - indeed, even a Tent Tortoise calls the place home!It is said that this creature was a friend of Callas's named Consigliere, roughly meaning "Counselor." Navia has also taken counsel with it in the past, finding it patient, quiet, and long-lived - just the sort of person you'd confide in. One day, Charlotte happened upon Navia babbling away to Consigliere, and out came her Kamera. The next thing anyone knew, many would come to speak to the Tent Tortoise on the picture's account. Navia herself would seek it out less from then on."Others should have a chance to chat with Monsieur Consigliere too," she would say with a straight face.
This world was probably full of contradictions from the beginning.Take Navia's father Callas for example. If the Spina di Rosula was more influential, a lot of things could get done more easily, but Callas stubbornly refused to accept the honorary title that the Palais Mermonia sought to grant him after the completion of the aquabus lines.Again, Callas would never intentionally hide what the Spina did from his daughter, and would speak to her of all manner of business techniques, even personally or engaging others to teach her how to use weapons, as well as bringing her to the negotiating table, as if intending to groom her to be his successor. But at the same time, he never spoke of the cause of her Clementine mother's death, nor would he ever share his feelings with her. For a time, Navia was even confused as to whether she and her father were close or distant.Later, Navia slowly came up with a theory: That her father may have treated her so to protect her. He let her learn and build up wisdom in the hopes that she would become independent and be able to survive the crushing stresses of life. As for why he would not speak of his own pressures or pain, or even Clementine's death, it was most likely to spare his daughter sorrow or unnecessary guilt. And so he remained silent, never having a heart-to-heart with his own daughter, no matter how much he missed his wife.As for his rejection of the title, this was possibly because he felt that Spina di Rosula would often be working with the common folk and a title like "Duke Callas" might create the perception of a difference in status between them, causing the Spina in turn to lose the trust of the people.Still, all of these are just Navia's own conclusions.This is another area where Navia found herself conflicted. She was in all things valiant, and in business straightforward, but she never did seek her father out to confirm her conjectures.-Did you make those choices to protect me, Papa? Did you underestimate my ability to sort out my feelings, even though you trusted me?She never spoke these thoughts aloud to her father. After all, she thought, they had time. Could she not wait until her stubborn old man stopped being so closed off, or until she had found better footing of her own, for them to have that conversation?It was time that would answer her question, and teach her that which her father could not.Some things in life are like that, leaving only time for on-the-spot learning and no time for preparation, just as she would go on to organize her own memos after Melus's departure.Well, everyone makes mistakes at first, right? But don't worry - Navia's a fast learner.
Fontaine is the Nation of Hydro, and thus, from time immemorial, many tales about water have been flowing through it, such as the belief that the rain that falls is the Hydro Dragon Sovereign's tears and that the Great Terrestrial Lake holds the emotions of humanity...The former is regarded as a ditty meant to pacify unruly children, while the latter is regarded by most to be unprovable, but as the matter of the "prophecy" progressed, people gradually turned to it for emotional sustenance.As Fontaine's post-disaster reconstruction work steadily progressed, Navia found that more and more people began to stay a while and tarry by the water, especially around Poisson.After her accession as President, Navia was never one for slowing down or taking breaks. But once, when she was walking by the waterfront, she glimpsed her reflection in the surface and was suddenly struck by the desire to stop and stare, just as she had gazed at ponds when she was little.She stooped down and scooped up some water, and watched as it drained away through the gaps between her fingers, till there was but a little left in her palm. Navia felt little from the water cupped in her hand, remembering only the traces of blood washed out by the rain, and the clothes left behind when the waters had retreated.She had always been one to see the bright side of things, and did not wish for her sorrow to spread to her companions, and so she seldom cried. But thus did the unshed tears swollen with the river of the years at last find their outlet.Those tears were blown dry by the wind, and did not fall into the waters, but Navia believed that they would not fade with time.Her tears were utterly insignificant, but a drop in the ocean, but just as all other waters in this world, they would evaporate, condense, and fall as light rain, and with the wetness of each rainy season that came, they would meet again.
When Navia no longer needed to tiptoe to touch the shelf tops, Callas gave her a notebook. The book contained no dates and had no format, and even contained some text without punctuation - and was written by her mother, Clementine.While it was initially a welcome surprise, frustration and gloom took root in her heart as she read on.The short essays began from the time Clementine went with Callas to visit the Fountain of Lucine. It seemed that from the moment they became intent on having a child, her mother would often think about her. In the golden sunflowers, she would see her child's hair, and in the bright lakes, her child's eyes.She wrote down every last one of these hopes and blessings: May our child brim with beautiful virtues, try the many adventures and lovely cuisines the world has to offer, and experience all manner of joy and happiness.This was not the first time Navia had read things her mother had written, but this instance certainly made her the happiest and angriest all at once. Why had her father only chosen to give this to her now!?But her fury was not to last. She soon finished reading all the thin book had to offer, and its ending was one of devastating simplicity."Though I have written much about our child, I suppose these are, in the end, just my own wishes."For some reason - their connection by blood, perhaps - Navia immediately understood the meaning of those words. Her mother had not wished for these hopes become a burden upon her growing child, and thus, her father had given this book into her keeping only after she had already grown into an adult by following her own path.That day, Navia, did something quite rare, and did not go out, instead spending a long time in her room. Equally rare, also, was her acknowledgment of her father's arbitrary exercise of authority in this case.Perhaps her mother had once intended to give her this notebook herself, once she was grown... when the time was right.
At a birthday party many years ago, Navia took her favorite tabletop game out.Perhaps it was because this was also her coming of age, but the participants playing that day were especially numerous. Amid this lively atmosphere, everyone - apart from the birthday girl, the star of the show - racked their brains coming up with characters exceedingly ill-suited to themselves.Melus, the steady hand, became the rash and careless commissioner, inviting all present to solve - or suffer under, more like - the ancient curse afflicting his family. Sonny, ever elegant in speech and etiquette, would play a potty-mouthed petty thief, even making the grand sacrifice of shedding his pale outer coat, which usually stuck to him like a second skin. The nervous rookie, Silver, having been dragged into this by dint of passing by, was made a mighty, mysterious mage.The most lethal blow came when Clorinde, who usually took charge of proceedings, decided to "band together" with the famed adventurer known as "Demoiselle" as a private doctor who missed every shot she fired. Someone had to do the healing, she reasoned - but alas, this left the role of game master open, with Callas unfortunate enough to be the only one left to fill that post. Thus was he forced to put his soft drink aside, and leave the audience stands (the bench) for the crowd of players (the sofa).Navia was most pleased with this start.The game, however, got off to a bumpy beginning, with the strange commissioner bursting his way into Demoiselle's residence during her birthday party, only to misjudge and crash head first into a triple-layered cake, nearly drowning himself in dessert and ending the millennia-spanning family curse by his own hand within the first five minutes.Demoiselle would quickly get the good-hearted doctor to save the man, with the doctor musing if letting him live on was tantamount to helping their enemies as she rolled the dice.The game master's expression did not change as he went faithfully about his duty in a low voice:"The young man, having braved the rain, was soaked to the bone, and both his hands were set a-trembling.""He did his best to clean the cream off his face and body, though he missed a few spots.""'Thank you, kind souls, thank you, for joining in my battle against this curse most wicked!'"They were unusually lucky during the middle portion of the game. To solve a problem, one must investigate its source. According to the mage's hypothesis, the commissioner's ancestor must have made a contract with a demon for some reason. "Ah, if I had only rolled higher, we would already know that reason..." grumbled the mage. "Bloody signed a high-interest contract without a care for his descendants, didn't 'e, the blithering idiot?" The thief blurted out. "Well then, can we steal the document and destroy it?" Demoiselle asked offhandedly.The inexperienced game master would regret allowing their actions for all time, for the thief's luck was truly ludicrous."...Demoiselle was clever indeed, and the thief just as profoundly skilled.""No one thought that the contract would fall into their hands so easily, and yet the words written upon it were nigh indecipherable..."The ending, too, was unusually happy. Thanks to the hardworking and kind (and also sufficiently rusty) game master, Demoiselle would finally drag the rest of the party, riddled as they were with status effects, into a confrontation with the ancient demon. The battle was as chaotic as ever, with the mage losing his sanity first, and the doctor not landing a single shot. But just as everyone's hit points were about to bottom out, the adventurer Demoiselle would hazard a venture. Using up a turn to move beside the demon, and tanking a full round of its attacks head-on, she knowingly gave the doctor a desperate order, as everything was going to hell: "Shoot me instead!"The doctor's dice were rolled before the game master could say anything. Callas counted the dice in silence, before taking three deep breaths."...The bullet pierces the demon’s weak spot, and the giant creature collapses into the abyss.""It returns to the darkness, and into slumber, taking that absurd curse with it.""Rejoice, rejoice, for the adventurer's courage and for her ill-omened ally!"Perhaps it was to go with the President's flow or out of genuine emotion, but there was indeed much rejoicing. Amidst the din, only Callas, who had begun to sort out the various items used for play, was stunned. He retrieved a golden-yellow jewel from within the dice box."Navia... I think this is yours."There were many people present, but this Vision did indeed belong to Navia, for it was with a flash of her thought that a great blade of Geo would slice her birthday cake in two... along with the table.Later at night, when the party and her excitement both had settled down, Navia would lie on her bed, unable to remember what she had been thinking when she had obtained the Vision. Had her mind lingered on the final victory, obtained only after much struggle and hardship? Or had she wished that her birthdays henceforth would be spent surrounded by friends, just like this one?If it was the former, that seemed to obliquely indicate that a happy ending must be preceded by many tribulations... so best to go with the latter.Thus were her thoughts as she lay at dreamland's door, still clutching the Vision.

<title>Jean/Lore</title>
<text>As the Acting Grand Master of the Knights, Jean has always been devoted to her duties and maintaining peace in Mondstadt.She had taken precautions long before the onset of Stormterror's assault, and she will guard Mondstadt with her life as always.
Personality
The righteous and rigorous Dandelion Knight, and Acting Grand Master of Mondstadt's Knights of Favonius.
As the acting Grand Master for the Knights, Jean takes all of her responsibilities and duties associated with the role seriously, regardless of how minor the tasks may seem, such as finding a lost cat. Due to this, Jean often exhausts herself trying to complete commissions from the locals, much to the concern of her fellow members.
Her devotion to her duties stems from two reasons; her upbringing as a child, and Varka's teachings. Even though he consistently takes his duties lightly, his relaxed and unruly personality has contributed to her growth. She shows no resentment towards his attitude, instead vowing to ensure that the city will be more prosperous and welcoming when he returns. Her work ethic makes her well-liked by both Mondstadt's citizens, her fellow members, and is noted by other organizations. Although she prefers using peaceful methods to solve problems, she will not hesitate to use force if necessary. She has a habit of calling Diluc her senior, even well after he left the Knights. Despite this, she acknowledges that they both share the same vision of protecting Mondstadt.
She sees Vennessa as a role model because of her exploits and how she left an impressive legacy behind and works tirelessly to maintain her legacy and Mondstadt's safety. Whenever she feels troubled or confused, she often heads to the Great Tree in Windrise.Master's Day Off (Quest)
Appearance
Favonian Devotion Gunnhildr's Legacy Sea Breeze Dandelion
Jean uses the Tall Female Characters tall female model. She has fair skin, gray-blue eyes, and medium-length gold-blonde hair.
Character Stories
The Knights of Favonius are the protectors of Mondstadt, the swords and shields of the city.In addition to keeping the city and the surrounding travel routes safe from the threat of wild monsters, the Knights' most important responsibility is maintaining order among Mondstadt's inhabitants.Mondstadt is the City of Freedom, but unchecked freedom without any kind of rules only invites chaos and anxiety.Jean's understanding of this is the reason she remains diligent at all times, holding herself to impeccable standards.However, she often finds that she exhausts her monthly quota of coffee within the first few days of the month as a result.
The Gunnhildr Clan is the oldest family of knights in Mondstadt, dating back to even before the very first epic was written.However, this long and proud lineage can also be a burden. Jean was raised by Frederica Gunnhildr her mother to be the successor to the Gunnhildr Clan.She was trained in all the things a knight must know and all the qualities they must exhibit, from discipline, etiquette and conduct, to knowledge of history and ballads, as well as maintaining peak swordsmanship and physical fitness. Only by upholding this standard can Jean carry the mantle of the Gunnhildr Clan, whose motto is: "For Mondstadt, as always."Some time ago, there was a joke commonly told in Mondstadt's taverns: A Gunnhildr learns to say "For Mondstadt, as always" before learning to say "Mommy."As a child, Jean once lifted her head up from the book she was reading, "Breeze Amidst the Forest Breeze Amidst the Forest - Ballad Selection," and saw the other children her age happily playing with pinwheels outside the window. The young Jean knew in that moment what her family motto meant to her.Now, when she lifts her head up from her piles of paperwork and sees the next generation of children doing the same thing, Acting Grand Master Jean has no regrets about her years of service to that motto."You have to give your all to do the right thing. Always."
"Master Jean is so reliable.""If you ever run into trouble, seek Jean. She'll know what to do."The denizens of Mondstadt, civilians and knights alike, all rely on Jean.If someone needs help for the right reasons, Jean does not hesitate to render assistance.Be it a quarrel down at the market, a relationship issue...No matter how unrelated it may be to a knight's job... Jean gladly lends a hand whenever she can."The chance to help someone in need is reason enough for a knight."To her, her knightly duty takes priority over her role as Acting Grand Master. She believes helping others herself is the best way to assist.She holds her fellow knights to the same standard.Lisa the Librarian once suggested that Jean take a break and "enjoy some afternoon tea, as is befitting of a lady."However, to Jean, doing that which is befitting of a knight takes priority over doing that which is befitting of a lady."Jean is so reliable."Such is the reputation Jean enjoys in Mondstadt.Her only gripe is that there are not enough hours in the day. She could never help all of those in need, even by forgoing sleep.The dedication and commitment required to become someone so reliable is unimaginable.
Given everything Jean has brought to her role as Acting Grand Master, people sometimes forget that there is, in fact, a Grand Master who is her superior.This does not bother her in any way, though. Her role and title within the Knights of Favonius do not affect her work ethic in the slightest.Her passion, honesty, and meticulousness come from two things.One is her education and training, which instilled in her a chivalrous spirit from a young age.The other is the devoted teachings of Varka, the free-spirited Knight of Boreas and Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius, currently dispatched on a crusade.The effect the relaxed and unruly Knight of Boreas Varka has had on Jean's growth has been great."Grand Master, please take your job seriously. All of Mondstadt looks up to you.""Well, you are my second-in-command, so helping me out is part of your job description. This way, I can focus on the really important things, wouldn't you agree?""..."He is the knight of new frontiers and legendary conquests, while she is the knight of maintaining peace and freedom.Jean does not resent Varka; perhaps there is wisdom in his conduct. However, what Varka leaves undone falls on her shoulders, and it is then down to her to do the right thing.Half a year ago, Varka led the elite knights of Favonius on yet another expedition away from Mondstadt.An expedition - how typical of Varka's character."I'll leave things here to you. I mean, you've basically been doing my job for years now, anyway.""Leave it to me, Grand Master."After seeing the Grand Master off, Jean sat by the window and thought to herself:Upon your return, I will show you a kinder, more prosperous, and more peaceful Mondstadt.
The great tree at Windrise is where the first Dandelion Knight came to the end of her journey.She was Vennessa, the founder of the Knights of Favonius and the restorer of Mondstadt.She bade farewell to the city she had vowed to protect, leaving behind her legend and a single sapling.After centuries of basking in the bliss of the thousand winds, this sapling grew into a towering tree.Jean was conferred the title of "Dandelion Knight" at the age of fifteen.The Dandelion Knight is also known as Lionfang Knight. Passed down through generations of knights, the title is bestowed upon only the most distinguished.On the day she received the title, Jean excused herself from the celebrations that followed the conferment ceremony. As if following in the footsteps of her childhood hero, she went and stood before the great tree.The title of Dandelion Knight symbolizes Vennessa's legacy of resistance and benevolence. So how, Jean thought, could one such as herself be worthy of this honorable title?More than a millennium had passed since Mondstadt's restoration. Did she really have what it would take to continue to protect this ancient and proud land of freedom?Beneath her outwardly mature visage lay the heart of a young girl, who had only just received the title and remained wholly unprepared for the task that lay before her.The wind blew from far away, and she felt it flow within her as it gently whisked away her doubts and worries, leaving her with an unwavering determination:For Mondstadt, as always.To become a warrior as kind and as determined as Vennessa, and to fight for her people and for freedom... Yes, this was the true meaning of her simple family motto.To this day, whenever Jean feels weary or feels herself beginning to waver, she comes and stands before this tree and lets the wind console her once more. It carries away her fatigue, so that she may once more have the strength to carry on.The great tree at Windrise marked the end of the first Lionfang Knight's journey.So too does it symbolize the beginning of Jean's.
Master Jean has a secret.The Gunnhildr Clan is a venerable knightly house. This prideful blood comes from Jean's mother, Frederica.Jean's father on the other hand is Seamus Pegg, an adventurer famed throughout the continent. When he came to Mondstadt, he dusted off his past self and started anew with the Church of Favonius, and ascended to high office within it, becoming known as the Cardinal of Daybreak.The two lovers eventually parted ways. Young Jean, holding her mother's hand, would watch the silhouettes of her father and her sister, Barbara, grow ever more distant.Later, Barbara would follow in her father's footsteps and join the Church of Favonius, becoming a deaconess much beloved by the people.Jean has always wanted to get closer to her younger sister by blood, but cannot bring herself to say anything when faced with Barbara's evasive eyes.Perhaps this all-too-similar awkwardness is a sign that the sentiment is shared.Master Jean has yet another secret.No matter how many times she has read the historical classics, despite her title of Dandelion Knight, and though she has become the Acting Grand Master whom everyone relies on...Jean still loves romance novels.This is not for the years as a young girl that she missed amid her training and duties, or due to the rift that formed in her parents' marriage.Jean simply yearns for the mutual attraction spoken of in such stories, for those emotions as subtle and fragile as spider-silk.As a knight, she must put Mondstadt and the Knights of Favonius first.But..."If I too could..."In her office, deep at night, Jean once again finishes reading "Vera's Melancholy.""If I have the time, it should be fine to go to Cape Oath, just before daybreak... right?"Lowering her head, Jean peeks out her window at the glittering stars above.
This schedule is accurate down to the minute.From a morning run with Amber followed a breakfast trip with Lisa on the way, to doing her own laundry by hand and settling her own change of clothes at night - all things great and small pack Jean's schedule rather tightly.Every completed item is ticked off, while ones delayed due to external factors list the detailed whys and wherefores.Next to the item "Mondstadt Public Facilities Review" - delayed due to a bout of illness - is written the following "completed at 3 am, end-of-month book purchase award is canceled."Jean sometimes thinks that inspiration for this schedule may have been the training program her mother drew up for her ten years ago.
If one were to go by skill alone, Jean has long become one of the best swordsmen in Mondstadt.But in Jean's heart, she would rather be a shield that defends freedom and song than a sword that cuts through corruption and darkness."Protecting" has always been a tougher task than "destroying."Around the time when she was promoted from Captain of her squad to Master of the Knights, a huge challenge stood before her. From without, the Fatui Enemies Fatui exerted diplomatic pressure, and from within, there were traitors - comrades of the Eroch former Inspector. Regrouping and finding a way to break through was no easy task.But Jean was able to fend off the external pressure with one hand, and lead the Knights to smash the many plots of the Abyss Order with the other, re-establishing the authority of the Knights of Favonius.Jean will never forget the moment she received her Vision. At that moment, all seemed to grow quiet as she felt the breeze flow through her hand. The world seemed to fade away, save for the time-honored motto of the house of Gunnhildr:"For Mondstadt, as always."

It is unknown how many generations are not represented by the Echoing Conches. The 'tightest' plausible timeline is as follows:
*** Let Person Z be the speaker of Five Mountains. Her grandchild, who she speaks to in Five Mountains, is Person A. Person A is from generation #1.
*** The speaker of Two Paths could be Person A (generation #1), now grown. She could be referring to herself as "Mommy" in third person, because she may be addressing her child. She speaks to Person B, who would be from generation #2.
*** The speaker of One River, "Grandma," could be Person B (generation #2), now grown. She speaks to Person C, who would be from generation #4.
*** The speaker of Four Winds could be Person C (generation #4), still a child.
*** The "Mother" in Clan of Song is likely not the speaker of One River, as while they both sound elderly, they have different voices.This is true for all four voice acted languages. She could be the mother between Person B (generation #2) and Person C (generation #4), which would make her from generation #3.

<title>The Knave (Previous)</title>
<text>the current holder of this title The Knave
The previous Knave, also possibly formerly known by the associated name Arlecchino,In the English localization of 'The Replacement's Secret', Lyudochka Snezhevna says that the House of the Hearth was set up by "Lady Arlecchino," but according to Momoyo's intelligence, the current Arlecchino, who succeeded the previous Knave, was herself a member of the House of the Hearth as a child. This would mean that the name "Arlecchino" can be passed down along with the title of "The Knave."However, the original Chinese version of Lyudochka's line only mentions "The Knave" zh=「仆人」, not Arlecchino zh=阿蕾奇诺. was one of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers. She was first mentioned in the The Very Special Fortune Slip in relation to the orphanage she ran, known as the House of the Hearth.The Replacement's Secret
Several years ago, she clashed with a child of the House of the Hearth, who ended up succeeding her as the current Arlecchino.Momoyo Her current status is unknown.
Profile
The previous Knave was cold and is suggested to have believed in bolstering the Fatui's strength by recruiting more orphans.
Story
She was the previous director of the House of the Hearth, where Efim Snezhevich was an instructor. She was implied to be extremely cruel, as she frequently blackmailed others into submission and despised failure, inflicting "searingly painful" punishments to those who failed her missions.
When Freminet was a child, The Knave made an agreement with Freminet's mother to take in Freminet; they were severely in debt, and the loaners eventually demanded both their house and Freminet as payment, which she refused to comply with. However, while Freminet was indeed protected, The Knave was cold to him, claiming his mother "abandoned" him and had him "sold" to the House of the Hearth to help with their family's debt. She also used Freminet's lack of knowledge of his mother's whereabouts to her advantage by threatening Freminet with withdrawing protection from his mother if he disobeyed orders. The current Arlecchino later revealed that the previous Knave had lied to Freminet.
After she was succeeded by the current Arlecchino, Efim Snezhevich began to act independently and continued to pursue the previous Knave's directives, with only a few of his subordinates knowing of his intentions. After Signora's death, Efim decided to take advantage of it to supposedly build the current Arlecchino's prestige to repay her kindness. To that end, he ordered Lyudochka to infiltrate the Shuumatsuban and, after she stalled on her mission upon realizing the Traveler and Paimon's involvement, changed his plans to sabotaging peace talks between the Shogun's Army and the Watatsumi Army by poisoning Watatsumi's water supply. When Lyudochka expressed concern that the mission would create more orphans, Efim stated that would be beneficial, as the new orphans could be taken in and trained. However, Efim was recalled to Snezhnaya before the operation could be carried out, giving the Traveler and Momoyo an opportunity to cut Lyudochka free from the Fatui.Where the Dandelions Find Rest
It is unknown whether the other known Fatui dealings involving members of the House of the Hearth are related to her or the current Arlecchino.

<text>Hasad the Golden Adventurer was a historian and adventurer in Sumeru.Royinjan He was the grandfather of Royinjan.
Profile
Hasad was a famous explorer and many of his adventures were passed down as stories, though knowledge of him seems to have faded over time.Vimana Agama: First Chapter He is known to have explored the ruins of Gurabad,Mysterious ParchmentHasad's parchment only states that he explored a "cursed city of brass." However, the parchment also makes mention of Shiruyeh, the historical figure who caused Gurabad's destruction; furthermore, the achievements 'Call of the Nameless City' and 'The Nameless City's Past', the former of which is linked to Hasad's parchment, both refer to Gurabad as said "Nameless City." and recovered the Amiti Device needed to access the Ruin Golem (Devantaka Mountain) Ruin Golem at Devantaka Mountain, but later claimed to have lost it while exploring a cave.
Hasad often told stories of his adventures to his grandson and the other children in Vimara Village, which inspired them to follow his footsteps and led them to pretend to be adventurers. They created a secret base in a cave near the village and buried one of the three fragments of the Amiti Device, which they had recovered, there. The children ultimately gave up their dreams of being adventurers as they grew older, though Royinjan still credits his grandfather's stories for influencing him to become an antiques dealer.Vimana Agama: Royinjan's Chapter

<title>Zhongli/Lore</title>
<text>Verify when character story 5 changes ( Altered Character Story). First notice of change was after Inversion of Genesis, but unsure at what exact point in time it changed.
Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's mysterious consultant. Handsome, elegant, and surpassingly learned.Though no one knows where Zhongli is from, he is a master of courtesy and rules. From his seat at Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, he performs all manner of rituals.
Personality
A mysterious expert contracted by the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Extremely knowledgeable in all things.
Zhongli is a calm, reserved, and polite man, who holds an air of nostalgia. Whereas he is said to have a stoic demeanor for duty, Zhongli also has a sentimental side.YouTube:  (Timestamp: 4m 0s) He knows much about Liyue history and culture in part due to his time as the Geo Archon; like Venti, he has many experiences and memories, as he was a god well before The Seven even existed and one of the oldest still living in Teyvat. He holds philosophical ideas towards money and has great respect for Liyue's traditions, including those that have been forgotten or warped over time. Zhongli tends to be humble, being worried he comes off as a "bourgeois parasite."
Zhongli tends to forget about Mora in transactions, agreeing to spend large sums of it without having any Mora on hand and even taking "discounts" as granted despite being an obvious scam.Guizhong (Quest) He often ends up relying on his acquaintances for financial support, such as the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor or Childe. Although he works for Hu Tao, he does not like her childish behavior.
It is later revealed that Zhongli's "carelessness" stems from being the creator of Mora. With the Gnosis allowing him to create limitless Mora, he never had to worry about running low on his personal finances. Unfortunately, when he chose to live among mortals, he lacked the foresight to find an alternative for them to continue minting Mora in his absence, along with creating a retirement fund for himself. As a result, he shamelessly spends the Mora of others.
Being the reminiscent person he is, Zhongli enjoys Osmanthus wine as it was the drink he and his former Archon friends used to have when they met up in Liyue. He dislikes seafood as it reminds him of the promise he made to his people in the past when he fought a particularly annoying type of sea creature, although he does not mind eating them if they have been ground to a pulp.
Appearance
Hermit of Mortal Life
Zhongli uses the Tall Male Characters tall male model. He has fair skin, amber eyes with yellow diamond-shaped pupils and red eyeliner on the lower lids of his eyes. He has mostly short, dark brown hair with a longer fringe on the right side of his face and Geo-amber tips that glow when he uses his Elemental Skill or Elemental Burst. There is one section of his hair on the back of his head that is waist-length instead of being cut short.
Zhongli's form appears to be the same as the one he uses as an Archon, as seen in his Statues of The Seven and various cinematics that show him as an Archon.
The Geo Vision seen at the small of his back behaves like other characters' Visions in most gameplay; however, it is not a real Vision, and there are a select few gameplay mechanics that reflect this.
In Rite of Descension, Zhongli as Rex Lapis appeared as a brown and amber Chinese dragon with gold accents known as the Exuvia.
Summary
Morax
On the surface, Zhongli currently serves as a consultant for the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. He works under "The Director," Hu Tao, and seems to be well-versed in an abundance of subjects. This has earned him the respect of Liyue's citizens, granting him the label of an old-fashioned gentleman. However, this knowledge did not come from thin air. Zhongli is in truth the latest mortal vessel of the Geo Archon, Morax, also known as Liyue's overlord and protector: Rex Lapis. He now wanders the streets of Liyue, as he "ought to be here to witness its rise and fall."Amidst Chaos, the Rock Is Unmoved
To the people of Liyue, their Archon carries many titles: the Geo Archon, the God of Contracts, the God of History, the Lord of Rock, the Groundbreaker, and the Warrior God among them. Having lived for over 6000 years, Zhongli has first-hand experience with much of Timeline Teyvat's history. He has presumably witnessed many of Teyvat's events, such as the cataclysm, the creation of The Chasm (Subregion) the Chasm, and the fall of Aria, Sonnet and Canon. Nonetheless, he is most known for his cold-blooded participation in the Archon War, and his founding of Liyue.
Around the beginning of the Archon War, Zhongli was the co-ruler of the prosperous Guili Assembly alongside the God of Dust, Guizhong, and the adepti. However, their combined forces could not stop the tides of war from taking the life of Guizhong. During a certain battle, despite their efforts and the aid of the adepti, Guizhong was overpowered by the opponent and the Guili Assembly was destroyed. After a massive flood swept through the area 3700 years ago, Zhongli was forced to move his people south of Mt. Tianheng and established Liyue Harbor,Stone Tablet Compilations: Vol. I where it stands to this day.
In present time, Zhongli has handed over his gnosis and with it, he has lifted the heavy weight of rulership he has borne for millennia. As the gnosis is now in Fatui possession, Zhongli is no longer inclined to act as Archon. He now spends his time reminiscing and enjoying the mortal experience. However, it is not to be believed that his story is even close to being over yet.

<title>Dragon</title>
<text>Dragons, also known in their juvenile form as Vishaps, are enormous and powerful creatures that inhabit both land and sea of Teyvat.
They are creatures of the Light Realm and were the dominant race of the old world before the arrival of the Primordial One. It defeated the Seven Sovereigns, the dragon-lords who ruled the old world, and created a new world for humanity.The Byakuyakoku Collection
Overview
Dragons are a naturally large species of reptilians with varying appearances. Some are quadrupedal, some are serpentine, and some either have wings or none at all. They typically have physical attributes reminiscent of their associated element; for example, the Earth Dragon Azhdaha has rough stone skin befitting of Geo, Dvalin has a much more sleek and svelte appearance befitting of Anemo.In Azhdaha's design notes and the Chinese version of 'Amidst Chaos, the Rock Is Unmoved', Azhdaha is called an Earth Dragon zh=地龙 rather than a Geo Dragon, which would be 岩龙, although he is still affiliated with the Geo element. The English localization similarly opts to translate 风龙 as "Wind Dragon" instead of "Anemo Dragon" in 'Breeze Amidst the Forest'. A dragon's size is proportional to its strength; the immensely powerful Azhdaha, at his full strength, was as large as a mountain rangeThe Unforged Lore and his size when fought in Beneath the Dragon-Queller is his form after years of erosion;Design Notes: Azhdaha Design The Birth of a Dragon: A Behind the Scenes Look At the Creation of Azhdaha Dvalin is also stated to have suddenly grown in both size and power when he reemerged as Stormterror.Knights of Favonius (Quest)
Vishaps and elemental dragons are born from the elements.Breeze Amidst the ForestAmidst Chaos, the Rock Is UnmovedAzhdaha claims that he was "forged of elemental crystal" zh=元素结晶创生之物 zh_tl=born from elemental crystallization, while his design notes mention that he is of the same species as Geovishaps. As elemental beings, they have far longer lifespans than mortals and even gods. They typically grow more powerful with age, and several dragons are known for having enough strength to rival the likes of Archons and other similarly powerful beings; such dragons include Azhdaha,Hidden in Nameless Treasures Dvalin, and Durin.Archon's Rival However, other dragons like Ursa the Drake can be felled by powerful Vision or Delusion-bearers.
Dragons are not immune to erosion and are still subjected to the rules of the Heavenly Principles. Vishaps and elemental dragons in particular are also extremely susceptible to the darkness of the Abyss Void Realm.
Vishaps
Vishaps Dragonheir of the Depths
Vishaps zh=龙蜥 zh_lit=Dragon-Lizard are reptilian creatures who have existed since primeval times. They are believed to develop into dragons after long periods of time,Fossilized Bone Shard such as how Azhdaha is from the Geovishap species. Some vishap species such as the Vishaps Geovishaps are able to absorb elemental energy from the ley lines and some vishap species, such as the Bathysmal Vishaps, are even capable of evolution, allowing them to inherit more and better combat-related characteristics than their predecessors. However, this evolution has severe consequences for their race - namely, the fact that they are no longer elementally "pure" and thus cannot have one of the Seven Sovereigns be born among them.Rimebiter Bathysmal Vishap Hatchling
Elemental Dragons
Elemental dragons zh=元素之龙 have not been well-documented, although several examples exist; Dvalin and the Seven SovereignsThree Realms Gateway Offering: The Eve are explicitly called elemental dragons, while Azhdaha is an elemental dragon by deduction.
Elemental dragons and ley lines will affect each other. During the events of the Prologue Chapter, Dvalin's rampage sent Mondstadt's elemental flow and ley lines into disarray, which forced the Knights of Favonius to cut off his connection to the other three of the Four Winds' temples.The term translated as "elemental sphere" zh=元素流动 in 'Knights of Favonius' is translated as "elemental flow" in the rest of the game, which is a more accurate translation. Powerful Geovishaps are capable of drawing energy from ley lines;Event Legend of the Vagabond Sword Enemy: Revived Primo Geovishap Azhdaha planned on absorbing the energy from the entire world's ley lines and using it to destroy everything after freeing himself from the Dragon-Queller,Jiu and at the start of his boss fight's second phase, he draws energy from the ley lines through his limbs. Conversely, when human mining at The Chasm (Subregion) the Chasm damaged the ley lines, it brought Azhdaha physical agony.
It is unknown whether non-elemental dragons exist, as all natural-born dragons named in the game have an elemental affiliation. Durin was created through alchemy and may not be subject to normal dragon physiology, while Ursa the Drake only appeared in the Manga and little detail went into its background or abilities.
History
According to legend, dragons were the dominant species of the old world and were led by the Seven Sovereigns and the Dragon King Nibelung. When the Primordial One, the eternal throne of the heavens, descended, it waged war against the Seven Sovereigns and after forty years of battle, emerged victorious with the help of its four shining shades. It began recreating the world to pave the way for humanity, while those who refused to capitulate, such as the Bathysmal Vishaps, fled into the oceans.
Since then, dragons have often come into conflict with denizens of the Human Realm, including humans and gods. Ancient gods and dragons have "never seen eye-to-eye," and on the rare occasion that gods, humans, and dragons have managed to coexist, later circumstances would drive rifts between dragons and those of the Human Realm.Prologue
However, according to Apep, the majority of dragons that had been reborn were now free from the hatred they once harbored against gods and humans,What Shape Does the Self Hold thus mostly ending the feud between them apart from a select few.
The Archon War
In Liyue, Azhdaha's awakening caused the earth to tremble with every movement he made. Morax approached him, seeking to stop the earth's shaking, and managed to befriend the dragon for some time, with the dragon even participating in the Archon War on Morax's behalf. However, later on, a combination of erosion and human mining at The Chasm (Subregion) the Chasm caused Azhdaha to forget his friends and his love for humanity. Azhdaha lashed out and attacked the Chasm, destroying the settlement at Tianqiu Valley in the process.Trails in Tianqiu Morax chose his duty to protect humanity and personally went to the mines to subdue him. Even the Geo Archon's power alone was insufficient to overpower the eroding dragon; he needed the help of Moon Carver, Mountain Shaper, and an unnamed adeptus to create a domain that would be able to seal Azhdaha away, and even then, Azhdaha willingly allowed himself to be sealed.
In Inazuma, the god Orobashi fell into Enkanomiya and eventually became its people's god, subduing the Bathysmal Vishaps which had harassed the humans and further empowering the Dainichi Mikoshi.PlayStation Blog:  It personally led research into Bathysmal Vishaps and their evolution. In the process, Orobashi and the researchers eventually came to the conclusion that vishaps naturally rejected Orobashi's power because they came from different realms, although they eventually succeeded in grafting Orobashi's coral onto vishaps.The Byakuyakoku Collection These coral fragments are necessary for the Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri, a ritual that prevents Watatsumi Island from being absorbed by the Elemental Realm.The Moon-Bathed DeepThe Still Water's Flow
As a result of the Bathysmal Vishaps' "impure" evolutions into Cryo and Electro forms, this caused a prophecy to claim that the Dragon of Water would be reborn in a human form.
In Sumeru, Apep, the Dendro Sovereign, was corrupted by King Deshret. Apep allowed Deshret to build a kingdom in its lands in return for it consuming his body for his knowledge when he died, but King Deshret died with forbidden knowledge, causing great anguish to Apep as it had to muster all of its strength to survive, unable to analyze the knowledge acquired.
In Fontaine, the Dragon of Water Hydro Dragon was the "first heart" of the Primordial Sea and had absolute command over it.Wings of Merciful, Wrathful Waters It was presumably the Hydro Dragon, the first Sovereign that gave Remus a goblet of primordial water.Broken Goblet of the Pristine Sea However, the Hydro Dragon presumably perished in the battle of the Seven Sovereigns against the Primordial One. Later on, the Dragon Prince Scylla gathered barbarians, Vishaps, and Lochknights to wage war against Remuria. The Harmost Boethius sealed Scylla's power,Song of Stillness but eventually both Remuria and the rebellion army got swept away by an inexorable storm, implying to be the Abyss.Golden Night's Bustle
After the Archon War
Sometime after Barbatos became the Anemo Archon and new sovereign god over Mondstadt, the newborn sky dragon Dvalin appeared before him, enamored by his music. Barbatos sang songs of Dvalin's beauty and befriended the dragon, later naming him the Dragon of the East of the Four Winds.That Green Fellow
Around 1,000 years ago, Ursa the Drake lurked around Mondstadt, occasionally threatening the City of Mondstadt. Ten years before her rebellion, Vennessa and her tribe, having wandered far from their homeland, were attacked by the dragon and fled to Mondstadt. Although they were taken in, they were promptly enslaved by the corrupt Mondstadt Aristocracy. When Vennessa stood up to Barca Lawrence on Venti - who unbeknownst to them, was Barbatos' mortal disguise - the Lawrence scion retaliated by purchasing Vennessa and her entire tribe, and forcing Vennessa to win successive gladiatorial battles for their freedom. The Lawrences, however, had no plans on letting Vennessa win; in exchange for peace, they negotiated with Ursa the Drake to sacrifice Vennessa and her tribe to it. In the middle of the battle, Venti revealed his true identity and drove Ursa away.Manga, Prologue:
The Cataclysm
The Khaenri'ah alchemist "Gold" Rhinedottir created one of her masterpieces, the artificial dragon Durin. 500 years ago, around the time of the cataclysm, she sent Durin to the surface world; however, it ended up unleashing havoc and destruction upon Mondstadt on its arrival. Hearing the suffering of his people, Barbatos awoke from his slumber and summoned Dvalin to aid him in ending Durin's rampage. The two eventually emerged victorious, slaying Durin over Dragonspine; however, Dvalin ended up ingesting Durin's poisonous blood and fell into a deep slumber in Stormterror's Lair the ruins of Old Mondstadt to recuperate.
The reborn Hydro Sovereign, Neuvillette, was born around 500 years ago, although there was no evidence that he was born due to the turmoil of Fontaine during the Cataclysm.A Familiar Threat archive=1 The Enkanomiya prophecy that the new Hydro Sovereign would be born in human form ended up becoming true, as Neuvillette was a human. However, he has not regained his full power and memory from his predecessor, since the Ancient Dragon's Authority was still separated from him as an Archon's Divine Seat. Focalors, the second Hydro Archon, managed to send him a letter to invite him to the Court of Fontaine as the Iudex. Neuvillette agreed, hoping to find the answer to his existence and his lost memory.Youtube:
Present Day
Four years before the events of the game, on Diluc's eighteenth birthday, Ursa the Drake was lured into attacking his and his father Crepus' caravan.When Vennessa faced off against Ursa 1,000 years ago, it was much larger than her and only fled after Venti directly ordered it to leave. By comparison, the Ursa faced by Diluc, Crepus, and later Dottore four years ago is much smaller. Whether Ursa weakened and shrank over time, or if the two are entirely different dragons of the same species, is left unknown. Their entire retinue was slain and Diluc was defeated by the dragon when Crepus intervened, using a Delusion to repel the dragon. However, the Delusion's power backfired on him; he died shortly afterwards,Manga, Chapter 7:  either from the Delusion itself or by Diluc killing him to spare him the agony. Sometime afterwards, the Il Dottore visited Mondstadt and personally slew Ursa, thus indebting Mondstadt to the Fatui.
During the events of the Prologue Chapter, the Abyss Order sought to weaponize Dvalin in their plans to destroy the nations of Teyvat and eventually, Celestia.YouTube:  However, their plot was eventually foiled by the combined efforts of Venti, the Traveler, Jean, and Diluc. Freed from the poisonous blood that put him in physical agony and freed from the Abyss Order's lies, Venti and Dvalin's friendship was rekindled and Dvalin became Mondstadt's ally once more.
Azhdaha, through the artificial vessel Jiu, attempted to break Morax's seal at the Dragon-Queller by having miners chip away at the seal from outside, while Azhdaha overpowered it from within. The plan was eventually thwarted when Zhongli (Morax's mortal vessel), the Traveler, and Kun Jun - who was unknowingly possessed by a fragment of Azhdaha's consciousness that retained his goodwill towards humanity - investigated the miners' disappearance and stumbled upon the plot. After a hard-fought battle, Azhdaha's body was resealed, while his spirit went dormant again.
Nahida, who was supposed to take care of Apep, had initially forgotten about her task due to her tampering of Irminsul to remove the forbidden knowledge. The removal of the forbidden knowledge ended up creating a large void in Apep's body, and by the time Nahida had remembered her task, Apep was on the verge of death, of which it would unintentionally destroy Sumeru with its abundance of energy. Apep was successfully saved by Nahida and two elemental fungi that had successfully escaped Apep's body during the cataclysm, with the elemental fungi sacrificing themselves to restore the Heart of Oasis in Apep's body. Apep would still remain distrustful of the gods and humans, but elected to instead watch them to see how far they could go under the Heavenly Principles.
Neuvillette gets back his Authority as one part of Focalors' plan to divert the Prophecy of Fontaine prophecy and save the people of Fontaine during the event of Masquerade of the Guilty. He uses the power to absolve Fontainians, give them the true properties of human due to his absolute control of Hydro and the Primordial Sea, therefore they are not dissolved in the Primordial Sea again when the second diluvian comes.
In Natlan, dragons are common. The nation's dragons have gone through long years of evolution and have since co-existed with humanity.Finale

<title>Mehrak</title>
<text>Mehrak is Kaveh's automated case. Kaveh uses Mehrak in both combat and common life. It first appears in the Competition on the Sands.
Profile
Mehrak is Kaveh's multi-function toolbox which he built from a modified machine core and some parts he had on hand after deciding he wanted an automated case to transport his offloaded tools when he goes out. Mehrak's primary function is to assist Kaveh in his work as an architect, such as aiding him in mapping and surveying tasks, but it also has other functions, such as grabbing and projecting Kaveh's building designs.
Mehrak also has utility in battle, as demonstrated in Kaveh's playable unit. In combat, Kaveh holds Mehrak like a suitcase and uses its grab function to suspend his claymore in mid-air, remotely directing its movements with his body motions. Kaveh also combines his Dendro Vision abilities with Mehrak's scanning and mapping functions for offensive purposes; during his Elemental Skill Artistic Ingenuity, Kaveh uses Mehrak to perform a radial scan around him, with Mehrak shown quickly circling him to perform this action before returning to his hand. During his Elemental Burst Painted Dome, Kaveh unleashes Mehrak's full energy, creating a cubic space around him.
Kaveh is only shown using and activating Mehrak manually during combat in his playable unit, implying that Mehrak was not programmed to be able to perform actions when Kaveh is not directly controlling and/or giving it commands.
Mehrak may also be lacking in defensive functions, as Kaveh does not use it to shield himself from Wanderer Wanderer's attack in the To Claim the Crown cutscene, nor does he use Mehrak to save himself when he falls after using it to secure the Diadem of Knowledge. Kaveh also does not use Mehrak to defend himself in his staggered animation, instead shielding himself with his Claymore.
Appearance
Mehrak is a green and white suitcase with gold accents. It consists of multiple segments which it can move freely, and has green lights underneath that serve as its "face." Mehrak appears to be able to close its "face" when it is not in use, giving it the appearance of a standard metal suitcase.
Mehrak's size appears to change depending on the function being performed, as it shifts down into a more compact box-shape during Kaveh's Elemental Skill Artistic Ingenuity before returning to its default suitcase form. Mehrak also takes this shape in one of Kaveh's idle animations for what appears to be projection-mode, although this time with its segments opened up.
It is unknown if Mehrak can "open" like a normal suitcase.
Story
Old Sketchbook
In Kaveh's playable unit, Mehrak is only alluded to in the final entry of Kaveh's Old Sketchbook, where the concept behind its creation is explained:
'Page 115: Suitcase design draft. Postscript: "Mehrak is an ancient word, one I have used as the name for this suitcase. It means 'little light.' More than anything, I hope it really can understand what I'm saying."'
Mehrak was likely created after Kaveh and Alhaitham began living together, according to the timeline presented in this Character Story, which begins with Kaveh's childhood and ends sometime after he moved in with Alhaitham.
A Parade of Providence
Competition on the Sands
Mehrak is first seen floating beside and following Kaveh in the Story Quest A Parade of Providence: Act II - Beginnings and Endings, Competition on the Sands. After expressing his displeasure with the Desert Fox desert foxes, he requests that Mehrak keep them at bay, to which Mehrak responds with a happy expression and a "beep-boop." After this interaction, the Traveler and Paimon approach Kaveh to ask how he's doing this round, while Mehrak can be seen in the background opening up its segments in front of the desert foxes, presumably to distract them or scare them away. After a few moments, the desert foxes disregard it and rush to Kaveh again, with Mehrak turning around to watch them with a "beep-boop" as they go before returning to Kaveh. It can be seen facing Kaveh as he scolds it for not keeping the desert foxes away as he'd ordered, although it doesn't visibly react.
Kaveh explains to the Traveler and Paimon that Mehrak is his toolbox and the story behind its creation; while working in the desert, he came across a merchant group selling a machine core excavated from a tome in the ruins of King Deshret's civilization. Believing he couldn't leave without the rare and complete specimen, he gave over all of the Mora on his person in order to purchase it, and eventually created Mehrak using it and the materials he had on hand. He also explains that Mehrak was created due to him having a need for an automated case to store his offloaded items.
When Paimon asks if it can understand them, it responds with a happy expression and a questioning "beep-boop," and it makes a sad expression when Kaveh dismissively turns away from it after expressing thankfulness that it can't talk since it can't give him an attitude. Kaveh says it can't understand 'complex' commands, implying that it has a low level of awareness. It falls silent after the topic shifts and later follows Kaveh when he leaves to escort the desert foxes out of the leyline zone.
To Claim the Crown
Mehrak shows up again the cutscene of A Parade of Providence: Act III - Gatherings and Partings To Claim the Crown in which Kaveh enters holding onto it. In the cutscene, Mehrak is initially seen with its face closed until Kaveh uses it to secure the Diadem of Knowledge. He motions for it to throw it to him and drops Mehrak due to the impact of the catch and the subsequent collision with the ground. During the fall, Mehrak can be seen briefly making a "sad" expression, although it's expression returns to "neutral" when it settles on the ground, immobile.
Mehrak is last seen lying unattended on the ground as Kaveh goes to place the Diadem of Knowledge on the stand to complete the round. Kaveh does not go to retrieve it, nor does it appear again after this cutscene, however, since Kaveh did not inquire about its whereabouts at the end of the event, it can be assumed that Mehrak was not damaged by the fall and was returned to him.
Notably, Nilou refers to Mehrak as "Kaveh's toolbox" and Kaveh as it's "owner" during her commentary, implying that others are aware of Mehrak.
The Pendulum of Weal and Woe
A Whole New Style
Mehrak only has one brief on screen appearance in Kaveh's Hangout Event Act I: The Pendulum of Weal and Woe in which it appears in the quest A Whole New Style. This scene reintroduces Mehrak, as Kaveh explains how it is his toolbox created from a machine core and its utility. He also says it's "not very smart," implying that it lacks sentience.
Kaveh is more cheerful when explaining Mehrak to Badawi than he was in A Parade of Providence, where he seemed exasperated at Mehrak and comparatively more detached from it. Here, he also refers to it as his "partner" rather than his toolbox as he did previously, suggesting that he has some degree of affection for it.
After this explanation, he tells Badawi that he'll use Mehrak to find a suitable location for the library before being interrupted by Setaria. At the end of the route, Kaveh uses Mehrak's projection feature to show Setaria, Badawi, and the Traveler the building design that he drew up. This interaction is shown in the Hangout Memory Blueprint for the Future.
Treasure and True Interest
Mehrak is mentioned by name by Kaveh in the Treasure and True Interest quest in which Kaveh calls on it for combat, but it does not show up onscreen outside of the battle in which Kaveh's playable unit is the trial character.</text>

<title>Carter Scherbius</title>
<text>Carter ScherbiusInteractable: Ancient Log Ancient Log  3 Ancient Log  3Suppression Specialist Mek is a Fontaine Fontainian figure from the cataclysm 500 years ago. Prior to the cataclysm, he was a member of the Narzissenkreuz Institute. Later, he became the research assistant and friend of Alain Guillotin at the Institute of Natural Philosophy.
Profile
Carter was born before the cataclysm, and his family experienced poverty during his early life. Later on, something "[went] wrong",Interactable: Ancient Log Ancient Log  2 Ancient Log  2 causing him to lose his familyInteractable: Court of Fontaine Region Ancient Notes Ancient Notes and friends. As a result, he entered the Narzissenkreuz Institute. In his adulthood, Carter joined the Institute of Natural Philosophy and became a research assistant to Alain Guillotin. Despite being older and possessing less innate talent than Guillotin, a child prodigy, Carter had a kind and optimistic nature. Carter was one of the few individuals at the Institute who held no resentment or prejudice towards Alain for procuring more research resources than them.
Carter suffered from an unknown terminal illness. One day, after showing a few minor symptoms, Carter accidentally knocked over a Primal Construct, triggering its activation unexpectedly. However, Alain successfully "tamed" the Construct and prevented any further mishaps. At some point, Alain brought his adopted sister, Mary-Ann Guillotin, to visit Carter during his medical leave. Alain engaged in discussions with Carter about various topics, although Carter couldn't fully understand.
Later, Rene de Petrichor and Jakob Ingold joined Alain's team. Carter felt ashamed for not being able to understand the discussions between Alain and Rene, and for being an adult looking for reassurance from a child as young as Jakob. They managed to successfully conduct research into Primenergy Machinery with, Alain and Rene intending to use the characteristics of ousia and pneuma to construct a new kinetic core.
Carter once used the pretext of field research and investigation to take the four to the town of Petrichor for a day of outdoor play and picnic, though they were still preoccupied with research. Carter brought a Kamera from the Institute to take photos for them. Meanwhile, Rene discovered remnants related to the Golden Troupe (Faction) Golden Troupe in Petrichor.Interactable: Ancient Log Ancient Log  1 Ancient Log  1
During Carter's critical illness, Alain and the other three frequently visited him. It was during this time that Carter discovered they were also from the Narzissenkreuz Institute. They reminisced about their shared experiences there, although the memories differed from Carter's recollections. Inspired by their conversations of "virtual neural network," Carter one day proposed an idea to Alain - a thinking "Kamera" machine that could continue taking photos even after Carter's passing, capturing moments for those dear to Carter, or people like Alain who were busy. Alain initially regarded it as somewhat pointless, but he recognized its potential for security and surveillance applications.
Soon after, Alain successfully invented Arkhe energy systems, also known as "Pneumousia Energy". Carter witnessed the first successful controlled annihilation reaction and the moment when the light bulb illuminated. He felt excited and accidentally knocked over an ink bottle. After resolving the energy issue, Alain shifted to another lab to research kinematics.
However, Carter's condition continued to worsen, and he frequently experienced prolonged periods of unconsciousness. The Institute's director, Dwight Lasker, had collected Carter's blood samples in an attempt to find a cure or a way to mitigate his illness. Alain advised him to go to Sumeru, which had access to more advanced medical technology. Later, Rene took samples of Carter's blood and skin, and a swift catspaw of the Ordo was dispatched to take them to Sumeru for further examination. Despite careful observation, the root cause of the problem could not be identified.Enigmatic Page (V)
Eventually, Jakob convinced Rene to repeat the method he had once used to save Jakob's life to save Carter, a process which involved harnessing the power of the Abyss.Interactable: Ancient Log Ancient Log  5 Ancient Log  5 However, the influence of Abyssal power caused Carter's bodily tissues to begin collapsing, despite Rene's efforts. They eventually managed to stop any further tissue collapse, and Carter still remained "alive," preserved by Rene in a somewhat conscious-state, as his voice could still be heard from what remained of his body. Rene notes that he had tried cutting the vocal cords from the tissue to silence the voice, but the organs grew back within days.
After the clash between the Marechaussee Phantom Marechaussee Hunters and the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, Alain named the Suppression Specialist Mek after Carter to commemorate him.Recon Log Mek
Inspired by Carter's idea, Alain invented the Recon Log Mek, a device that encompassed the desired functionalities. Mary-Ann's mechanical assistant, Seymour, used a "virtual neural network" for "thinking, security and surveillance applications" instead of logic trees.Enigmatic Page (XII)
After the failed experiment of Rene's rebirth, Jakob apparently used Carter's remains and the opponents of Ordo for experiments, ultimately creating Narzissenkreuz. The remaining remains were then grafted onto "those who have lost their intellect," presumably referring to the Hilichurl, in order to create Caterpillar.Interactable: ??? Log</text>

<title>Fellflower</title>
<text>the Whopperflower Albedo mimic and event boss the impostor who created it Primordial Albedo the standard enemy Whopperflowers
The Fellflower is an event boss for the Shadows Amidst Snowstorms Rise of the Fell Flower Rise of the Fell Flower Challenge in Act II of the Shadows Amidst Snowstorms Event.
It is a Cryo Whopperflower created by Primordial Albedo, using the alchemical notes he stole from Albedo and Durin's blood; the mutations allow it to mimic humans, of which it attempted to impersonate Albedo.
In the latter part of the story arc, he was referred to by Albedo as "Subject Three" in his story. "Subject One" is Rhinedottir's 'successful' Albedo; and "Primordial Albedo Subject Two" is the Fellflower's creator, "Primordial" Albedo - the failed iteration of Rhinedottir to create human life.
Strategy
When first fought, the Fellflower is massive and comes with a shield that reduces damage it takes. While Pyro is effective against the shield, it is important to also destroy the Arcane Fruits spawned by the Fellflower to deal significant damage to its shield. When an Arcane Fruit is destroyed, 3 drops of Arcane Essence will spawn. It is necessary to pick up the Arcane Essence as failing to do so will result in the Fellflower absorbing them and regenerating its shield. Picking up the Arcane Essence will cause percentage-based DMG from the active character's health, which can also down them.
During the shielded phase, a Healing healer is highly recommended, as Arcane Essence can deal a significant amount of true damage that ignores shields when picked up. A ranged character is also helpful for destroying the 2nd type of Arcane Fruits, which suspends in midair and is difficult to reach for melee characters.
When the shield depletes, the Fellflower shrinks to a much smaller size and becomes much more manageable, acting like a normal Whopperflower. The Fellflower will be invincible for a short period of time while transitioning to the second phase.

Having absorbed the blood of the wicked dragon, this Whopperflower has undergone immense changes. Handle with care! Map waypoint description</text>

<title>Guili Assembly</title>
<text>The Guili Assembly zh=归离集 zh_rm=Guīlí-jí was an ancient civilization in the region of Liyue that was established and ruled by the God of Dust Guizhong and the God of Geo Morax (Rex Lapis),Stone Tablet Compilations: Vol. I and supported by other gods such as the God of the Stove MarchosiusThree to Get Ready, and Here We Go and by the adepti. At its height, it was a prosperous and flourishing civilization that possessed highly advanced engineering skills.
During a particular battle of the Archon War, Guizhong was slain, the Guili Assembly was destroyed, and its people were scattered. Morax eventually regathered his people and established Liyue Harbor 3,700 years ago, which has remained standing to this day.

The name "Guili" is derived from the first character in Guizhong's name (归终) and from Morax's name at the time.Transcription from a stone tablet The name he went by is unknown, but he currently goes by the name Zhongli, which contains the same character (钟离).
History
Origin
Little is known about the Guili Assembly before the Archon War, but it seems to have its origins with the foundation of Liyue itself. When Morax first descended, much of western Liyue was submerged underwater and its people were at the mercy of sea monsters such as Baqiu.Primordial Jade Winged-Spear He lowered the tides, raised Mt. Tianheng, and subdued the sea monsters. After peace settled upon the land, people began mining from the mountains he raised and used the stones they mined to create settlements.
At some point in time, Morax became allies with fellow gods Guizhong and Marchosius. Guizhong and the adepti, Cloud Retainer among them, built the Guizhong Ballista on Mt. Tianheng. For reasons unknown, Guizhong and her people then moved north of the mountain and joined Morax's settlement. Her people took up agriculture and farming as their livelihood, and farming towns appeared all throughout the area.
Archon War
3700 years ago, the Guili Assembly was destroyed as another casualty of the Archon War. During the conflict, Guizhong was slain. Following the battle came a great flood that devastated the area, forcing its inhabitants to move south of Mt. Tianheng, where Liyue Harbor was established.
Geography
The Guili Assembly was centralized in the area now known as Guili Plains. At its height, it was said to have spread a thousand miles around, with Stone Gate as its northern boundary. Through in-game measurements, assuming its territory was a circle with Guili Plains as its epicenter, it can be deduced that its western boundary was the edge of Jueyun Karst, its southern boundary was the area that is now the entrance to Liyue Harbor, and its eastern boundary was the end of Mingyun Village.</text>

<title>Liyue Qixing</title>
<text>The time of the adepti has long passed. If even the Liyue Qixing don't want to face that truth, then what future is there for Liyue? Keqing when the Traveler first meets her
The Liyue Qixing zh=璃月七星 zh_rm=Líyuè Qīxīng zh_tl=Seven Stars of Liyue is a committee made up of seven merchants and business leaders who govern Liyue,Liyue Qixing specializing within the commerce and trade sectors. The job of the Qixing is to implement the policies laid out by the Geo Archon Morax and manage the day to day governance of the region of Liyue.
Every year, one of the Qixing is selected to perform the Rite of Descension. During this ritual, the Geo Archon appears before the populace in his dragon–qilin form and gives predictions that shape the business trends within Liyue for that year.
History
The people of Liyue turned to commerce and artisanship for their livelihood, and prospered once more. Those who prospered above the rest joined, calling themselves the Qixing. Thus was formed the framework around which Liyue Harbor developed. Under the jurisdiction of the Qixing were all the known trades, no business of Liyue took place inside or outside the nation that was not known unto them.|the historian Zichang
The Liyue Qixing was formed roughly 2,000 years ago, following the end of the Archon War. With the savage fighting between gods concluded, commerce and artisanship flourished, and those seven who prospered above all others joined to form the Qixing.Stone Tablet Compilations: Vol. I After aiding Morax throughout the Archon War, the half qilin Ganyu chose to remain in Liyue to help the humans build a new government. She took up the post as the organization's secretary, working alongside its changing roster for centuries.
Following Rex Lapis' apparent death, the Liyue Qixing quickly acted to consolidate their position and fill the power vacuum the god had left. Having learned through a secret message that the Archon was not dead but instead had relinquished his post, the Qixing announced to the people that he had passed in a trial and took up the governance of the region without divine guidance.The Fond Farewell In taking charge of Liyue, all of the Geo Archon's previous duties fell to the Liyue Qixing and the Eight Trades. With the end of divine rule, the Qixing began the task of reevaluating the old strictures and establishing new laws. They also had to address the fallout of the events surrounding Rex Lapis' "death", including relations with the Snezhnayan Fatui diplomats and the cessation of Mora production at the Golden House.
Responsibilities
They are responsible for implementing the policy that comes down from Rex Lapis and making rulings on important matters. They are akin to the hands and feet of Rex Lapis.
The role of the Qixing is to uphold the laws laid down by the Geo Archon and attend to day-to-day affairs in Liyue harbor of all magnitudes. They are considered "the hands and feet of Rex Lapis".Huixin Each year, one of their number is chosen to preside over the Rite of Descension, in which Rex Lapis appears before the people of Liyue Harbor and delivers predictions that determine the course of business for the next year.Rite of Descension Both the Ministry of Civil AffairsClerk Zhao and the Millelith, Liyue's security officers,Cai Xun report to the Qixing. Additionally, the Eight Trades, which represent the major industries in Liyue, are under the jurisdiction of the Qixing.Farewell, Sweet Salt
The members of the Qixing are the seven leaders of the seven enterprises of Liyue. Considered "the cream of the crop," all are highly accomplished in their own fields and are the pillars of Liyue's prosperity. Their highly revered positions are coveted by many, and some have many enemies. The current Tianshu, Uncle Tian, has consolidated his position for years through a strategy of pitting his enemies against each other.A Secretary in a Sea of Humanity Most members of the Qixing choose to play things safe and keep a low profile while carrying out their work. The current Tianquan, Ningguang, is a notable exception and is frequently seen around Liyue Harbor, making her the subject of much talk.
Each of the Qixing are equal in rank and there is a clear internal division of labor within the Liyue Qixing's duties. The Tianquan is responsible for maintaining the book of ancient laws laid out by Morax and all subsequent amendments. Each Tianquan has introduced amendments to ensure the laws align with Liyue's current societal needs. The Yuheng is in charge of land, livelihood management,Hongyi construction, and real estate, The role requires strict regulation and developmental direction and is subject to over a hundred contractual obligations. While each member has their own specialty, their roles can overlap. For example, while livelihood management matters such as water supply quality fall under the domain of the Yuheng, the Urban Areas Sanitation Act, addressing sabotage of water sources, was amended by the Tianquan. Additionally, while the Tianquan personally maintains the book of laws and amendments, other members also participate in law-making and the Liyue Qixing as a whole is expected to interpret the law, address loopholes, and punish violators. Some cultural affairs, such as the Moonchase Festival, are also overseen by the Qixing.One for the Foodies, Two for the Show
The Liyue Qixing meet at Yuehai Pavilion in Yujing Terrace to discuss official matters.Tieshan Although the day-to-day operations and those who work directly under them are based at Yuehai Pavilion, there are days where all seven attend to their business elsewhere. The Yuheng, Keqing, frequently works away from Yuehai Pavilion at places including the south wharf, The Chasm (Area) The Chasm, and the uninhabited wilderness. Likewise, when seeking a solution to important business matters, Ningguang sequesters herself in her Jade Chamber until she reaches a decision.
Associates
I'm always happy to help a junior colleague from Yuehai Pavilion.
All of the Qixing's decision-making is supported extensively by Ganyu, the General Secretary of Yuehai Pavilion. Behind the scenes, she is responsible for the calculations and data behind all of their policies and decisions. Every ordinance and regulation announced is also the work of Ganyu. As general secretary, she is not attached to any one of its leaders, but instead supports the work of the whole organization. She has remained a constant associate to the Liyue Qixing since its inception. Some members of the Qixing also have personal secretaries or assistants. Ningguang employs three secretaries, Baiwen, Baishi, and Baixiao, who are her closest and most trusted confidantes and aid her with researching important matters.Zhongli's Treat The Yuheng also employs assistants, but due to her extreme work ethic and perfectionism, her assistants typically last no more than three months. Other secretaries, such as Huixin, also work at Yuehai Pavilion. They are junior colleagues to Ganyu and, like her, are not attached to a specific Qixing member.
The Qixing founded and secretly runs the Wangshu Inn as an operation to covertly assist Xiao in his fight against evil gods, as well as to gather intelligence of any persons-of-interest entering Liyue. All of the employees of Wangshu Inn are agents of the Qixing, and are among those who act as their eyes and ears, gathering intelligence across the region.Equilibrium The Crux The Crux Fleet, an armed merchant fleet led by Captain Beidou, also works closely with the Liyue Qixing, although The Crux is an independent organization and not under the Qixing's direct control. Specifically, Beidou is a close collaborator with the Tianquan and was personally chosen by Ningguang to do her "dirty work."

<title>Dragonheir of the Depths</title>
<text>The Dragonheir of the Depths is the moniker of the Bathysmal Vishaps that terrorized the underwater nation of Byakuyakoku, now known as Enkanomiya, where the ancestors of Watatsumi Island lived in the depths of the sea for thousands of years before Orobashi Watatsumi Omikami came and defeated them, sealing them under the depths of the sea.The Moon-Bathed Deep (Quest)
Story
History
Prior to their name change, the people of Byakuyakoku regarded them as the Dragonheirs of the Depths. It wasn't until after their experiments were observed by Orobashi that their name was changed to Bathysmal Vishaps.The Byakuyakoku Collection
During olden times, for thousands of years, the Dragonheirs of the Depths terrorized the people of Enkanomiya (formerly named Byakuyakoku). In order to survive the sharpened claws of the dragons, the people of Enkanomiya learned that the Dragonheirs loved the dark and the light scared them away, thus theyThe Byakuyakoku Collection used thousands of lanterns to ward them off.The Byakuyakoku Collection But these efforts were not particularly effective and so the people prayed and lamented until one of the Primordial One's Shining Shades, Istaroth, answered their prayers and gave Abrax enough knowledge to create the Dainichi Mikoshi. The people of Enkanomiya relied on the light of the Dainichi Mikoshi for an untold amount of years until Watatsumi Omikami came several thousand years ago and defeated the Dragonheirs of the Depths, suppressing them under the sea with its jade corals. Soon after, Watatsumi Omikami brought the people of Enkonomiya to the surface and created Watatsumi Island for them to live in.
Legacy
The spirit of Watatsumi Island constantly feels the calls of Enkanomiya, down in the depths. As a result, its soil is slowly bleaching, becoming Holy Soil. If this continues, Watatsumi Island will one day become a desert as pale as the moonlight.
According to tradition, every several centuries, the shrine maidens of Sangonomiya Shrine must take advantage of the moment when the spirit veins flow smoothly in order to break the barrier between Enkanomiya and Sangonomiya, to retrieve a Jade Branch of a Distant Sea Jade Coral Branch, left behind by the Orobashi Omikami to suppress the Dragonheirs of the Depths, and perform the Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri ritual in order for the sunken "spirit" to return, which will stop the erosion of the Holy Soil.
However, though there are many Jade Coral Branches, as this tradition continues, the Dragonheirs of the Depths may one day break through its barrier and invade Watatsumi Island.</text>

Fontaine is one of the seven regions of Teyvat. It is the nation that worshipped Focalors, the Hydro Archon and God of Justice.
Archon Quest Chapter IV takes place in this region.
How to Access
Access to Fontaine is unlocked after completing the The Outlander Who Caught the Wind. Teleport Waypoints in Realm of Farakhkert, Sumeru and Marcotte Station, Fontaine are also unlocked after completing the Song of the Dragon and Freedom.
Description
A terrestrial sea in the center of Teyvat.Following the direction of pure currents, crossing wilderness, the depths of the forests and vastness of the sea of sand, arriving at the origin of all the waters of the continent. At the top of the waterfall, in the depths of the capital atop the terrestrial sea... a story that has never been heard, a legend that has been forgotten, like a lost kingdom sunken beneath the waves, yearning for a bard to sing its drowned songs.
A story that has never been heard, a legend that has been forgotten, like a lost kingdom sunken beneath the waves, yearning for a bard to sing its drowned songs.Following the direction of pure currents, crossing wilderness, the depths of the forests and vastness of the sea of sand, arriving at the origin of all the waters of the continent.At the top of the waterfall, in the depths of the capital atop the terrestrial sea, the curtain softly rises on the start of the adventure's next chapter.
Of the regions of Teyvat, Fontaine prides itself as the hub of culture and the arts; or in the words of Francis, a traveling merchant from the region, "true beauty and elegance." The newspaper The Steambird is the main newspaper of the Court of Fontaine; Mona is a columnist on it, suggesting that they have writers from all across Teyvat. According to the Steambird, Fontaine is located in the center of TeyvatHoYoLAB:  and is the source of all waters on the continent. Its entire continental plate is elevated, making it significantly higher than other nations. At the edge of Fontaine is a massive waterfall that stretches for thousands of meters.
Fontaine boasts its immersion in the development of technology, as referenced in multiple story points - such as the Mikage Furnace, designed by Fontaine engineers, including Xavier; and limited events - such as in Fabulous Fungus Frenzy Story Fabulous Fungus Frenzy, where the Wisdom Orb is a Fontaine-local-designed equipment designed to suppress specific behaviors in organisms.
Minor events that have featured Fontaine's technologic prowess include Core of the Apparatus, which features Fontainian inventions that can manufacture toys and furnishings, and Evermotion Mechanical Painting, which features mechanical gear systems.
There is a Arkhe special energy system in Fontaine; however, it is mentioned to be on the verge of declining, causing many people to seek alternative sources.A-Toymaking We Shall Go: Core Propulsion Additionally, Santon states that the air in Fontaine is "practically toxic fumes" and that there is much less connection to nature there, though he is not necessarily referring to the entire region.Where Are the Fierce Creatures?
According to Vasco, a diving certificate can be obtained in Fontaine, and diving itself is an important profession in the nation.
Liben had described Fontaine's locals as believing that some type of "judgment" was "soon to come," possibly in reference to the prophecy described in the Chapter IV Archon Quests about the nation being destroyed by rising sea levels to absolve its people of their "sin."
The Fontaine Research Institute is located in Fontaine, though its original main buildings were destroyed in an experiment conducted by Edwin Eastinghouse.
Other races also reside in Fontaine, such as the Melusine and, once upon a time, the Oceanids.

Notable Features
Fontaine features many unique mechanics and environmental hazards:
Arkhe
Arkhe is composed of two opposing energy types: Ousia and Pneuma. When they meet, an annihilation reaction will be triggered which generates energy.
* Fontanian characters all have an Arkhe alignment, as does the Traveler when resonated with Hydro. Furina can perform a charged attack to switch her Arkhe alignment. Characters can also receive a temporary Arkhe alignment by picking up a Pneumousia Block.
* An Arkhe-aligned character can trigger a reaction by attacking an object with the opposite alignment, which can cause the following effects:
** Temporarily shutting down Clockwork Meka
** Stopping an Enhanced Pneumousia Amplifier from applying buffs to nearby enemies
** Launching The Miraculous Antoine Roger Aircraft, which will typically grant a Remarkable Chest upon reaching its destination after dealing with any obstacles
** Balancing a Pneumousia Relay, which can trigger various effects
** Opening a Pneumousia Storage Box
Diving
Unlocking the first Statue of the Seven in Fontaine grants the Diving ability.
* The player will not consume Stamina and cannot Drowning drown while swimming in Fontaine. Fast swimming consumes Aquatic Stamina instead, and when it depletes the player must slow down, similar to how sprinting works on land.
* Elemental Skills and Elemental Bursts are disabled while in the water; instead, the player can obtain abilities from Xenochromatic Creatures (see Xenochromatic Abilities below).
* Allogravity-Condensed Water Body Allogravity-Condensed Water Bodies are floating cubes of water found at the site of the Fontaine Research Institute explosion. The player can dive inside them just like any other body of water in Fontaine.
** The player receives an on-screen warning if they approach the side or bottom boundaries of the cube; continuing and crossing said boundary will cause the player to start falling.
** During the Fontaine Research Institute, Stagnating in the Rubble, several of the cubes are contaminated by condensing components from the exploded Arkhium reactor. "Allogravity-Condensed Water Body" affected by energy flow These cubes have a purple tint and the player diving inside them will continuously accumulate Turbulent Energy Flow until the condensing component is found and removed. Accumulating too much Turbulent Energy Flow causes all characters to Fallen Character drown.
* Entering a Current will cause the player to move quickly along a pre-determined path, only able to control movement laterally within it.
* Hidden underwater locations and objects can be revealed by touching an Echoing Conch or using the Sonar Waves Xenochromatic ability.</text>

<title>Iwakura Michihiro</title>
<text>Iwakura Michihiro ja=岩蔵道啓 ja_rm=Iwakura Michihiro, born Mikoshi Michihiro ja=御輿道啓 and later given the title Douin ja=道胤, was the eldest son of the oni Mikoshi Chiyo, the legitimate heir to the Mikoshi Clan,Emblem of Severed Fate and the adoptive brother of Mikoshi Nagamasa.Katsuragikiri Nagamasa
He lived through the cataclysm five hundred years ago, during which Chiyo was corrupted by the Abyss during a battle against a certain "creature of sin" and turned her blade on the Raiden Shogun.Mask of the Kijin As one of Beelzebul's most trusted allies, Chiyo's betrayal was a great stain on the Mikoshi name. Michihiro secluded himself in Konda VillageAmenoma Kageuchi out of shame until he met Teruyo of the Mt. Yougou Yougou Tengu, who gave him the name "Iwakura" to distance him from his past. He thereafter became the patriarch of the Iwakura Clan.
He had the famed sword "Hakuen Bankou Amenoma" ja=薄縁満光天目 and its 'kageuchi' (spare copy) Amenoma Kageuchi, forged by the Amenoma Smithy owner at the time. The sword Hakuen Bankou is passed down to each bearer of the "In" ja=胤 title. Meanwhile, the 'kageuchi' was gifted to the Saimon Clan of the Konda Village as a token of gratitude from him.
Story
As Mikoshi Michihiro
Little is known about Michihiro's early life, besides the fact that he was Chiyo's biological son. At some point in time, Chiyo fostered Nagamasa and adopted him into the Mikoshi Clan.
As Iwakura Michihiro
During his time in seclusion, Iwakura encountered Teruyo of Yougou. She gave him his "Iwakura" name and set up a wager: if he could touch her during their duel, she would let him call his blade the "Tengu Victor." He managed to accomplish this feat with a swing so strong, it destroyed both the abandoned temple they dueled in and the blade he used. After refining his swordsmanship style, Michihiro named it the "Tengu Sweeper" and established his own sword school, known as the Iwakura Art.
The Kujou Clan recruited him as their sword instructor and bestowed upon him the title of "Douin."
Legacy
At some point while Michihiro was still alive, the Maguu Kenki was built based on his Iwakura Art and modeled after him. However, the combat puppet did not work as intended and was abandoned,Maguu Kenki and Ako Domeki's crew stole a Maguu Kenki puppet during their conflict with the Shogunate.Event: Echoing Tales Story Echoing Tales
The Iwakura Art has been passed down to modern times and is still presently practiced. However, after the enactment of the Vision Hunt Decree, many of its practitioners became vagrant Nobushi and Kairagi. During the Traveler's journey across Inazuma, they inadvertently cause the destruction of the Iwakura Clan.</text>

<title>Hilichurls/Culture</title>
<text>Daily Life
Architecture
merge Hilichurl Structures into this section?
Hilichurls have been observed building structures for daily use, storage, and guard duties. Some structures are built using "long-lost techniques."
Structures are primarily made of wood and stone, with metal and cloth as needed or desired, and may feature decorative designs drawn or etched on cloth or stone. A long, pole-like white material that tapers to a point at one end is often used. Though its composition is unknown, it appears flexible enough for shaping yet rigid enough to support completed structures. This material is always covered with decorative designs.
Hilichurlian structures largely appear simple and crude but may be remarkably sturdy.Hilichurl Spiral WatchtowerHilichurl Totem Fence They may even be specially treated, although how and by whom are both unknown.Wooden Hilichurl Fence
Hilichurlian furnishings include Building Hilichurl Style Hilichurl Style Buildings as well as:
* Hilichurl Spiral Watchtower
* Hilichurl Straw Hut
* Hilichurl Archery Target
* Hilichurl Horned Pot
* Wooden Hilichurl Fence
* Hilichurl Totem Fence
Activities
Hilichurls have been observed patrolling, standing guard, practicing combat, dancing, staring into the distance at the edge of cliffs, staring at items of interest such as Flaming Flowers, relaxing, napping, mining and watching other hilichurls. They may do so alone, in pairs, or in groups.
Dancing
Hilichurls may dance when they are happy.Language ExchangePoetry Exchange They may also dance around items of interest, such as the broken sundial near the Thousand Winds Temple, and foods such as bird eggs and lavender melons.Crisis of Shields Hilichurls may also appear to watch fellow hilichurls who dance.Event Energy Amplifier Fruition Places of Interest: Energy Amplifier 2021-12-24 Places of Interest Act II Act II Hilichurls can also be observed dancing as conducted by an abyss mage.
Food
Hilichurls eat a large midday meal and likely also eat another meal before sleeping.
Hilichurls enjoy meat so much that the phrase hil='mosi mita' hil_lit=eat meat, is also an expression of happiness in Hilichurlian, and have been observed keeping Forest Boars in fenced-off areas, suggesting that they may practice raising livestock. They do not enjoy eating vegetables, fruits, and other plants, to the point that the phrase hil='mosi gusha' hil_lit=eat grass, is also an expression of sadness in Hilichurlian. While hillichurls have not been observed practicing agriculture, they value seeds.Handy Handbook of Hilichurlian Respawning Hilichurls in Tatarasuna, west of Kannazuka's Statue of The Seven
Hilichurls have been observed boiling waterEvent Wishful Drops Area II: Wishful Drops Story Area II: Wavering Waterweeds Wavering Waterweeds using Flaming Flowers.Moonfinger
Religion and Spirituality
Little is known.
Social Relations
Hilichurlian social structure is mostly understood through Jacob Musk's books, Hilichurl Cultural Customs and Hilichurl Ballad Selection.
Most hilichurls live in tribes, such as the Meaty Tribe, Sleepy Tribe, and Eclipse Tribe in Dadaupa Gorge.
Samachurls, who are the oldest, and Lawachurls (literally Chief-churl in hilichurlian), who are the strongest, have the highest social status. Lawachurls prefer to be alone, although they may be followed by admirers. Samachurls lead tribes and may be ousted by Mitachurls (literally good/meaty-churls), who are stronger and more aggressive. Mitachurls may also cause infighting.
Hilichurl Rogues are not affiliated with any tribe and wander for reasons unknown, though some speculate that they are seeking a bygone splendor that once belonged to their people. They may occasionally assist a hilichurl group or tribe for a short time before continuing on their journey.
Hilichurls communicate with other tribes, and also have long-distance communication.Mutual ExchangeHilichurl Justice
The vast majority of hilichurls are wary of humans and attack on sight, but some are willing to talk.
Designs, Motifs, and Symbols
Every hilichurl wears a mask, as they fear potentially seeing their own reflections.Requiem of the Echoing Depths Some masks have an insignia with a brown diamond,Stained Mask while others show their corresponding element.Pyro Hilichurl ShooterElectro Hilichurl Shooter
Technology
Hilichurls likely rely on the technology given to them (e.g., only given orders to handle machinery) in addition to things in their environment (see Electro Hilichurl Grenadier) and do not appear to have had notable technological innovation. They hail from the time of Khaenri'ah, but still use primitive weapons.
Slimes
Hilichurls use various types of Cryo, Pyro and Dendro Slimes to manufacture Exploding Barrels. Cryo Slimes are also used to keep food fresh, and large Anemo Slimes are used to make vehicles for transporting food.Cryo Hilichurl Grenadier
Grenadiers, Mitachurls, Lawachurls and Rogues are known to use slimes to assist them in battle.
Weapons
Observed weaponry ranges from wooden clubs and crossbows, to the Mitachurls' axes and Samachurls' staves and the Rogues's projectiles and scythes. The use of axes suggests that hilichurls possess at least basic smithing prowess, as the Mitachurls' axes are far too large for any other intelligent species to wield. Crossbows are suspected to be provided by the Abyss Order.
Hilichurls can utilize the elements to supplement attacks, but how they draw elemental energy is unknown.
Language
Hilichurlian
Hilichurls communicate in Hilichurlian. There are no known cases of hilichurls who do not know Hilichurlian. The only known example of a hilichurl able to communicate in another language is Caterpillar Cater.
Hilichurlian is an oral language with no observed native writing system. The Latin alphabet is used by non-native speakers to write Hilichurlian.
Politics
Hilichurls are mostly hostile towards humans for reasons unknown.
Some Hilichurl groups are affiliated with the Abyss Order, potentially partly due to both groups hailing from the fallen nation of Khaenri'ah. Abyss Mages are capable of understanding and speaking Hilichurlian, and are able to convince the groups to assist them.
Some hilichurls, however, are hostile to the Abyss Order: the Cautious Hilichurl in Starfell Valley requested help defeating enemies consisting of Abyss Mages and Hilichurl Shooters.Hilichurl Justice note=Cautious Hilichurl in Starfell Valley

Overview
Appearance
Black wings appear to be a common trait among the tengu: Teruyo is described to have black wings, while Kujou Sara also has black wings. All known tengus have had crow masks affixed on their head. Akuou mentions beating the Sasayuri Great Tengu at the time and taking his mask as a trophy, implying that the masks of the tengu are either of great honor or importance, or even essential to their survival.
Powers and Abilities
The tengu appear to be well-versed in both archery and swordsmanship, although their arts are not restricted to those within their clans.

A tengu's speed is said to be nearly unrivaled. Kitsune Saiguu technically won a race against the Chieftain of the Yougou Tengu but believes that the tengu went easy on her,Hakushin Ring while Iwakura Michihiro's grazing of Teruyo's wing during a duel won him the name "Tengu Victor."
According to Teruyo, a name given by the Yougou possesses divine powers. It is unclear whether this is an ability possessed by all tengu or only the Yougou Tengu.
Tengu warriors are known to possess magical items known as feather fans. When wielded by a tengu, a feather fan can have various effects; while in the hands of ordinary people, it is only capable of "making one's body lighter" when in mid-air (such that it increases one's movement speed while gliding).Red Feather Fan
While tengu are slimmer than oni, they are far stronger than their appearance suggests.
History
Early History
The tengu are some of Inazuma's inhabitants and lived a mostly secluded lifestyle. One tengu, Sasayuri, was acquainted with Ei; during the war against Watatsumi when Orobashi inexplicably invaded Shogunate-held islands, he was slain in battle. At some point, the Great Tengu Reizenbou was gifted the Thundering Pulse by the Shogun. It is unclear whether it was Makoto or Ei who gave the gift.
The Cataclysm
During the cataclysm, Teruyo met Iwakura Michihiro Mikoshi Doukei, who was living a life of self-exile in Konda Village as a result of his mother's actions against the Shogun. Teruyo later disappeared after Doukei managed to graze her wing, asking him to forget about her. The "Great Tengu", Kitsune Saiguu's protector, also disappeared during this time.
Present Day
Like the oni, most tengu continue to live in seclusion. Prior to the Traveler's arrival in Inazuma, there are at least two tengu - an unnamed tengu that Arataki Itto had dueled in Byakko Plain, and Kujou Sara, who was integrated into human society after falling from a great height while battling monsters and fell unconscious when she was discovered, having been saved by her recently granted Vision.

<title>Kazuha's Friend</title>
<text>Kazuha's friend was a former Electro Vision bearer from Inazuma. He was executed by the Raiden Shogun after challenging and losing to Kujou Sara in a duel before the throne.
Profile
He was a good friend and close traveling companion of Kaedehara Kazuha Kazuha's. Kazuha explained to the Traveler that one day, his friend asked about a sword art of which he had heard, the "Musou no Hitotachi." Kazuha told the friend that it could only be witnessed when "divine punishment" is administered and that it was the pinnacle of the Raiden Shogun's skill, a symbol of ultimate power. Kazuha's friend believed that there must be one who could withstand it, and that "there would always be those who dare to brave the lightning's glow."
Story
While fleeing from the Vision Hunt Decree, Kazuha had heard that his friend had challenged the Vision Hunters to a duel before the throne. Kazuha's friend dueled with Kujou Sara, who had accepted the duel on Beelzebul's behalf in Tenshukaku, where the defeated would face divine punishment from the Raiden Shogun. When Kazuha arrived, the duel was over and his friend had lost. Kazuha ran away with his friend's dying vision in his hand.YouTube:
Legacy
Kazuha would later try to find someone to resonate with his friend's Masterless Vision, even asking Beidou to host the annual The Crux Clash Crux Clash with it as a reward. Unfortunately, no one, not even the Traveler, was able to resonate with it. Kazuha then spent some time roaming Liyue to see if anyone was able to, but he was unable to find anyone before being recalled to the Crux for the trip to Inazuma.
In a cutscene during the Archon Quest The Omnipresent God, Kazuha is seen wearing his friend's Masterless Vision next to his own Anemo Vision. When the Traveler leaves Tenshukaku and was immediately attacked by the Shogun (despite saying they could leave the place alive), the Masterless Vision returns to its original state as his friend's words echo again: "'There will always be those who dare to brave the lightning's glow'." This second Vision allows Kazuha to harness both the power of Anemo and Electro at once, which he uses to successfully block the Shogun's attack, saving the Traveler. The Electro Vision is then sent flying by the Shogun's blade, falling to the floor and deactivating once again.
As many people were unaware of the Masterless Vision and many Inazumans revered the Shogun, they believed that it was simply inconceivable or that he had used a Delusion due to eye-witnesses seeing him use both Anemo and Electro.Upon the Plain, a Purple Shadow Word of the feat also caught up to Scaramouche, now reformed into the Wanderer, who was amused and impressed by the feat.
Broken Blade Mound
His sword can be found in a small ravine north-east of the Grand Narukami Shrine. In the ending cinematic of The Omnipresent God, Kazuha can be seen placing his friend's Masterless Vision next to the sword. After completing The Omnipresent God, the Masterless Vision can be seen near the mound, along with a Sapphire cat.

Character Stories
Amber is an Outrider of the Knights of Favonius. In an age where Outriders are becoming obsolete, she continues on with her responsibilities.It takes a newcomer only a few days to feel right at home with this passionate girl.Whether it's before the Good Hunter's signboard, the banks of Cider Lake, or the tree tops at Windrise, one can find traces of this vigilant Outrider in red anywhere.Once spotted by her, no suspicious individual can ever escape her interrogation.
From a young age, Amber has always had boundless energy and a positive outlook on life.Each day, she burns with a fiery enthusiasm that sees her go about her life like a whirlwind, smashing through any obstacle that stands in her way.At times, however, her excessive energy can make her quite the troublemaker.Needless to say, she was quite a handful when she was young. Her infamous deeds include accidentally dropping a bird's nest on Amber's Grandfather her grandpa's head while trying to steal the eggs from it and setting a Dendro Slime's leaves on fire, causing it to scurry about like a wild animal. These minor offenses gained her some notoriety among hunters' camps.Somehow, Amber was always able to escape the scene of the crime whenever she caused an incident, and not even a veteran Outrider could catch up with her. Invariably, it was Amber's grandpa who ended up on damage control duty each time his granddaughter's misbehavior caused yet another incident.To Amber, her grandpa's silent, unconditional love was like a warm breeze that wrapped around her like a blanket. She knew that it was because of this love that he accepted her and took responsibility for her deeds, and she embraced it silently.But it was only on the day that her grandpa resigned from the Knights of Favonius that she finally understood the full extent of the responsibility he had borne all those years.
Amber's grandpa was once the leader of a mercenary group. He came from Liyue Harbor and was tasked with protecting merchant caravans as they traversed Teyvat. One day, on a routine escort job, the caravan fell prey to a savage monster attack. He was the only survivor, saved by a doctor from the Knights of Favonius.Too ashamed to return home and anxious to repay the debt, Amber's grandpa joined the Knights of Favonius.Before long, he single-handedly founded the Outriders, trained each one of them personally, and began leading them on missions.It also wasn't long before he found love in the foreign land of Mondstadt and started a family.Years later, Amber was born into that family. During the day, she would crouch by the window and secretly watch him training the Outriders. At night, she would sneak into the yard and practice the moves he had taught that day.Amber's grandpa was touched by her enthusiasm, and decided to teach her everything he knew."When Mondstadt accepted me, it became my homeland. Then, I decided to watch over this new home of mine. Maybe one day, you will inherit this responsibility... Hah, but then, who knows what the future holds?"As the coarse skin of her grandpa's palm rubbed against her head, a bewildered but earnest Amber nodded energetically in response.
Something happened one day four years ago that profoundly changed Amber.That day, her grandpa left his coat of arms and sword in his office and simply disappeared, leaving no note and telling no one he was leaving.He had been the beating heart and the backbone of the Outrider division, and without his leadership they rapidly became undisciplined and lost their edge.A few failed operations later, the Outrider division was facing obsoletion. In the end, it was preserved as a part of the Knights' organization, but in name only. Experienced members either transferred to another detachment or resigned, and so few outriders stayed that they simply did not have enough people to fulfill their daily patrol duties.On top of this, rumors that Amber's grandpa had defected made recovery even more difficult for the struggling Outrider division.Amber personally experienced this entire episode, having just been admitted to the Outriders before it all began. With the decline of her squad, she experienced true loss and disappointment for the first time in her life. No longer her carefree former self, she was filled with a new determination: She was going to grow up and become a true outrider as quickly as possible, no matter what it took.She had never made an actual plan before, and lacked the maturity to know where to start. But what she did have was confidence and courage - and lots of it.She wanted to show she had inherited her grandpa's determination, and she wanted to find out where he had gone.But more importantly, she wanted to inherit her grandpa's former role and become a loyal protector of her homeland.
Life in the Knights of Favonius was not easy for Amber in the beginning.Being as young as she was and having just lived through the trauma of losing her grandpa, the senior knights made a point of taking special care of her.However, for a girl as desperate to excel as she was, being taken care of by others implied that she wasn't yet mature enough to stand on her own two feet.Accordingly, she voraciously sought out extra responsibilities and made this as visible as possible to her seniors.Finally, during an intense engagement with some monsters, the seniors noticed her bravery and resourcefulness in the heat of battle.That was the moment when they realized that their little girl was growing up.As she matured, she also became more at ease with herself. Whatever feedback she met with, be it praise, rebuke, silence, or taunting, her response was always the same."For sure, I may still have a way to go before I catch up with my seniors. But one day, I'm gonna be the best Outrider ever!"Amber is not prone to too much deliberation, preferring instead to speak her mind, truthfully and frankly, at every occasion.She firmly believes that she will not disappoint her grandpa.
Today, Amber is still the firecracker she always was, burning with endless passion and energy.Now that she's all grown up, Amber holds firm to her grandpa's teachings as she spreads her Wind Glider's wings and watches over the City of Freedom with the eye of an eagle and the cautious cunning of a bunny rabbit.The "Crimson Knight" is known throughout Mondstadt.The people are delighted to see the mischievous little girl they remember growing up to be a guardian they can rely on."Never fear, Outrider Amber is here!"Her self-confidence is simply unshakable:"I am Outrider Amber, the one and only outrider - which makes me the best one out there!"
Amber doesn't make writing a daily diary a habit, only electing to write special or memorable events down in her journal."I finally caught that magical bird! It's called a Rami... something. I don't remember. But I've been chasing it for three days, and I've only been able to sit down for a proper meal today. That magical bird was a really cunning one, burrowing in the thick forest like that. Good thing I didn't give up! Best of all, Jean Master Jean gave me special permission to pluck a feather plume from it as my reward. Hehe, I'll wear it at my side every single day!""I'm sure I followed the cookbook to the letter and grilled the meat for six minutes. But while the outside is charred, the inside isn't cooked yet... Did I not control the heat properly? But I really am hungry, so I'll just have to try again tomorrow. One day, I'll make the best steak, and I'll call it... the Outrider's Champion Steak!""I met Traveler a strange outlander today. I was suspicious at first, but as it turns out, this outlander is both reliable and capable. Ugh, come to think of it, what would I do if an enemy that strong showed up? ...I musn't fall behind. I must train harder!"
Amber once believed that if she took on her grandpa's post, she would understand why he left Mondstadt.However, even when she officially became an Outrider, she was no closer to unraveling the mystery behind his wordless departure.Her grandpa had left nothing for her to find either, indicating that she would have to forge her own path.Amber floundered for a while, until she flipped through Wind, Courage, and Wings (Book) an old book of fables that she would eventually come to treasure."What you lacked was not wind, but courage. It is courage that has allowed you to become the first flying birds of this world."Amber realized that she shouldn't wait for directions from someone else, but that she should be like those courageous birds that spread their wings and flew into the blue skies."There must be something that only I can do. There must be."The moment she realized this, a Vision began to shine brightly at her hip.

Amber befriends Collei after the latter's arrival in Mondstadt. Amber does her best to help Collei with her search while also investigating the Black Fire Incident, during which Amber discovers the metal birds planted by the Fatui and disables them before they can cause any harm. Amber also takes Collei to Ludi Harpastum festivities and shows Collei that people lead happy lives in Mondstadt.
Amber resolves to help Collei after she discovers that Collei is the culprit behind the Black Fire Incident but does not want to use her powers.

<title>Gourmet Supremos</title>
<text>the faction the series of World Quest and Commissions The Gourmet Supremos
The Gourmet Supremos is a group initially comprised of three friends who travel around the world in a quest to improve their Cooking culinary skills. After completing 'The Gourmet Supremos: The Importance of Eating Well', Kamei Munehisa joins the group as their bodyguard and fourth member.
They are the focus of 'The Gourmet Supremos', a series of World Quests and Commissions in Inazuma and Sumeru.
Overview
quote   = Making food with unknown ingredients is the principle of Gourmet Supremos.
speaker = Xudong
Though they all share the same goal of improving their skills and cooking good food, each Gourmet Supremo has their own unique perspective on food.
Xudong, who was likely the one who named the group,The Gourmet Supremos: On the Road originally ran a restaurant in LiyueThe Gourmet Supremos: Cook-Off and had a cooking rivalry with Xiangling's father Chef Mao. He travels the world in the hopes of finding a "breakthrough," but struggles with inspiration.The Gourmet Supremos: Breakthrough Thinking However, this does not stop him from experimenting with dishes; whenever he gets a new recipe, he only follows it for a few days before he begins to "improve" them. These improvements are often ways to make the dish less expensive, much to Parvaneh's bewilderment.The Gourmet Supremos: Foodie Quiz He has a desire to make sure the people around him never go hungry, and believes that if everybody in the world could eat well, it would be a better place.The Gourmet Supremos: The Importance of Eating Well
Parvaneh is a scholar from the Sumeru Akademiya, focused on her mission of creating an "ultimate seasoning," a seasoning that can make any dish delicious. The "ultimate seasoning" is the topic of her thesis statement, though the other Gourmet Supremos and her fellow academics question whether such a thing is possible. Julie and Xudong are wary of the seasoning and usually try to stop her when she seasons their food. Her reason for joining the Gourmet Supremos, despite her hatred of the name, is partially influenced by Xudong's unconventional cooking methods; similarly, Xudong was likely willing to take her in because of her skills. She has particular tastes and does not find plain foods like Onigiri very impressive.The Gourmet Supremos: The Deep Divers
Julie is an Adventurers' Guild adventurer of extreme focus, who enjoys eating and has the perspective that "it's all good as long it tastes good." She has no issue with most types of food, except for Parvaneh's special seasoning.
Kamei Munehisa is a serious man with deeply-felt opinions about cooking. His best dish is the Tri-Flavored Skewer, which he often made while he was a cook in the Shogunate and later teaches to Xudong. He believes in creating dishes that are of perfect quality, and explains that his heart is never satisfied with mere acceptability. Munehisa refers to this as the "extreme path," and relates it to swordsmanship. He hopes to enlighten Xudong to his pursuit of perfection, though the other man seems hesitant.
After traveling in Inazuma, they travel to Sumeru next.Gourmet Supremos: Within Our Duties</text>

<title>Havria</title>
<text>Havria was the God of Salt who lived in the region of Liyue before and during the Archon War. She is known for her gentleness but also for her relative weakness, two qualities that ultimately led to her demise - not at the hands of other gods, but of her own people.Diary of Roald the AdventurerFarewell, Sweet Salt
Her last piece of land, and the place where she met her doom, is a sealed domain in Sal Terrae, Liyue.
Profile
Introduction
Havria was a goddess known as the God of Salt who stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the many gods of Liyue. Her extraordinarily gentle nature saw her quickly ousted in the hubris of the Archon War, before being ruthlessly murdered by one of her own followers.
Although not a particularly powerful god, Havria had two artifacts: a salt chalice that magically refilled itself with salt, and a ruler that could turn the surrounding area into salt to be harvested.
Story
History
Havria was born some time before the start of the Archon War. When Zhongli throws her relics into the waters at Guyun Stone Forest, he calls it a "homecoming,"A Record of All Things which suggests she originated from the area.
When the Archon War broke out, she refused to partake in it due to her kind nature and relatively weak powers. As a result, she and her people fled between different parts of Liyue to escape the war, making countless concessions to other gods and eventually settling in a tiny plot of land in what is now known as Sal Terrae. It is said that Liyue's Flower Ball custom may have originated from Havria giving out bunches of flowers to her people as either a blessing or a simple gesture of comfort.Customs of Liyue: Flower Ball
The city stood for several centuries until Sal Terrae's first and last king slew her as a gesture to show that her kindness could not help them survive the Archon War's brutality. In that instant, the city fell and turned to salt. Many rumors and myths about her death emerged from that; some say that her body can still be found in its death throes, while the king lived to the end of his days in solitude, or committed suicide out of guilt.
In reality, Havria's body dissipated and turned into a salt flower (the 'sal flore') - but her powers, which spread uncontrollably in the surrounding area, transformed all of her adherents who could not escape into salt. The king's body can be found, in the same position he was in when he stabbed her.
Zhongli, Morax's current vessel, states that Havria's fate served as a lesson for him during the Archon War.
Legacy
Those of her people who managed to escape salinification were scattered across Liyue. Many traveled to Liyue Harbor, under the control of Morax, and some of those people eventually became the Yinyuan Hall of the Eight Trades, specializing in the salt industry. Descendants of the survivors, fearing that Havria placed a curse on them, returned to Sal Terrae to break the sword used to kill her and place it on a pedestal, along with two of her relics under the belief that she would forgive them for their sins. They resealed the area after the deed was done.
Over thousands of years, Yinyuan Hall's rendition of Havria's death grew distorted; they began to believe she was a powerful goddess who was murdered by Morax out of jealousy.Shadow of Yore However, other surviving tales about Havria continue to tell her true story.
During Historia Antiqua Chapter, Act 1: Sal Flore, Wanyan of Yinyuan Hall recruits Zhongli and the Traveler's help in an "archaeological expedition," which is actually an attempt to find proof that Morax murdered Havria. At the end of Of Mysteries and Salt Havria's domain, they find a single flower of salt - all that is left of her - and all her adherents who were salinized upon her death, including the king who murdered her.</text>

<title>Art of Khemia</title>
<text>The Art of Khemia is a form of alchemy that was developed in and primarily used by the people of Khaenri'ah. Because Khaenri'ah was an underground nation with little natural fauna, the Art of Khemia focuses on the creation of life; its capabilities are vastly different from those practiced in the Seven Nations of Teyvat.
500 years ago, the Art of Khemia was a major factor in the fall of Khaenri'ah during the cataclysm.
Overview
quote   = The universe is the dark essence of the true starry sky, and the earth is the accumulated memories of time and lives. The chalk: that is you. The earth is where alchemy gets its name, and is the basis of all life. And this... This is new birth.
speaker = Rhinedottir, as she demonstrates the Art of Khemia to Albedo
Details about how the Art of Khemia was developed or how it works are currently unknown. Those who have attained the pinnacle of learning and alchemical prowess are capable of creating synthetic life, the "apex achievement" of alchemy.The Snowy Past Currently, the only known person to have attained this level of ability is "Gold" Rhinedottir.
The Art of Khemia played a major role in the cataclysm 500 years ago, which resulted in the destruction of Khaenri'ah at the hands of the gods.YouTube:  As such, both Dainsleif and Venti - who were present for the fall of Khaenri'ah - express their apprehension over Albedo's practice of it.
Synthetic Lifeforms
When the pinnacle of attainment in alchemy is combined with unimaginably vast learning... the apex achievement is the creation of human life.|Albedo, about his existence as a synthetic human
While Rhinedottir created many monsters, whose invasion of Teyvat contributed to a large part of the conflicts during the cataclysm, she considered only two of her creations to be "miraculous beings": the dragon Durin and Albedo, her successful synthetic human.
The star-shaped mark on Albedo's neck was left after sealing the area where life force was infused into his vessel. He likens it to a birthmark and a pontil mark left on glassware made through glassblowing.The Shadows Deepen
Before she created Albedo, Rhinedottir produced another Primordial Albedo "abandoned experiment" during her Primordial Human Project. After deeming it a failure, she apparently had him devoured by Durin, allowing him to eventually re-emerge after Durin's death over Dragonspine.
Ei can be considered as a Khemia-Art practitioner, because as stated Wanderer Lore Wanderer's lore: 'Puppet-making techniques had their roots in Khaenri'ah, and his nature as a creation of the Electro Archon made him all the more special'. Additionally, The Doctor Dottore is a practitioner as well, as the techniques he used to create his segments were derived from studying The Balladeer Scaramouche's body composition.

<text>Timeline
A timeline of historical events in the Fontaine region.
The Old World
Timeline The Old World
* During the Seven Sovereigns' era, the Primordial Sea was located on the surface of the world. Most of Teyvat's lifeforms originate from the Primordial Sea due to its unique properties.
** Legend says that the Dragon of Water, one of the Seven Sovereigns, once resided in Fontaine. It is said to be the "beating heart" that ruled over the Primordial Sea.
** Hydro Vishaps believe that the Primordial Sea originally had a composition similar to that of blood, and that life originating from the Primordial Sea evolved into different, individual forms by developing blood vessels to keep the waters of the Primordial Sea within themselves. (Whether this belief is held by other Vishap species has not been determined.)
* After arriving in this world, the Primordial One takes a portion of each of the Seven Sovereigns' elemental Authorities. The Sovereigns go to war against the Primordial One, but are eventually defeated. Sometime following its defeat, the original Dragon of Water withers away.
The New World
Timeline The New World
* According to the Oceanids, Egeria is created as the Primordial Sea's new heart by the Four Shades Shade of Life Shade of Life, a divine envoy and one of the Primordial One's Four Shades. Despite being created by a "ruler of humans," Egeria is created entirely from material originating from Teyvat.
* Towards the end of the "first era" - likely the era established after the Primordial One's rise to power - humanity begins to covet things that belongs to Celestia and attempt to break away from their fates.
* The people are eventually punished by having their cities destroyed by tsunamis and then buried underwater after 100 days of rainfall, which "drowned all sin and arrogation" and forces humanity to rebuild civilization all over again.
Oceanids
* According to legend, the first Oceanid is born after Egeria sheds the "first tear," which later gives birth to all other Oceanids. Egeria bestows a task to the Oceanids "to seek an understanding of the diverse array of species and to love every creature."
** To fulfill Egeria's desire to connect everyone in the world, the Oceanids disperse across the waters of Teyvat to act as "spies." However, Rhodeia of Loch denies any ulterior motive on Egeria's part.
* Some Oceanids soon desire to live on the surface, having seen and envied human life. Not wanting to refuse her followers, Egeria decides to fulfill their request by taking water from the Primordial Sea and inserting it into the Oceanids' "blood" vessels, thus creating humanoid forms for them to walk on land.
** Celestia deems Egeria's "act of life" a sin and sentences her to be sealed for her crimes. At some point, Egeria and the Fontainians learn of a Prophecy of Fontaine prophecy claiming that eventually, the people of Fontaine will be dissolved and turned back into their original forms.
The Archon War (?–2000 years ago)
Timeline The Archon War (?–2000 years ago)
* In Fontaine, no true civilization is built for a long time - long enough that Gurabad in Sumeru rose and fell - until Remus arrives on Meropis and teaches the people there how to build houses, farm, and appreciate the arts, especially music. He conquers the other islands in the region, forces the "great dragon beneath the abyssal depths" to yield to him, and establishes the civilization knows as Remuria.
* Remus believes that so long as the "harmonious symphony of prosperity" continues to play, Remuria will prosper forever. He sets about perfecting his civilization, paying particular attention to his capital city, Capitolium.
* Remuria is prophesied to face "the most utter destruction" and its peoples to return to the primordial sea.
** Hoping to make Remuria's peoples escape the flood, he mixes the primordial water with an immortal stone to create a Golden Ichor who would contain the souls and minds of his peoples and places this Ichor full of souls into Golems, and tries to replace the entire Primordial Water with his golden Ichor.
** To escape the prophecy, Remus aims to eliminate all which might bring about such destruction or who does not accept his rules: Lochfolks, Vishaps, Barbarians.
* Barbarians and Vishaps eventually start a rebellion under the leadership of the Dragon Scylla against Remus and his golem army and golden troupe.
**Remus eventually realizes his wrongs while Remuria is being destroyed and gives out his final orders, attempting to restore peace back to Remuria.
** The Harmost Boethius sees his retreat as a betrayal, steals the golden Ichor and seals the Dragon Scylla with it.
* Remuria and its peoples are swept away by the Abyss at the same time the Dragon is sealed. The golden Ichor is eventually corroded by the Primordial Sea and the survivors turn back into "Barbarism and Annihilation".
* After Remuria is destroyed by conflicts and rebellions, Celestia commands Egeria to return from her primeval prison to take over Remus' position and rule Fontaine.
** Egeria returns to Fontaine and gathers the survivors, mediating between their feuds, and instructs them to establish new cities around flowing springs, thus commencing an era guided by law which endures to the present day. She is awarded a Gnosis, ascends as the Hydro Archon, and becomes one of The Seven.

* Egeria exiles all of the criminals from her nation, who live in misery as they are shunned by society.
** Eventually, some of these criminals beg for forgiveness, which Egeria heard through the waters. Egeria grants their wish for redemption, ordering them to guard her secret - the entrance to the Primordial Sea - beneath the waves. This results in the construction of the Fortress of Meropide, where the prisoners live and guard the path to the Primordial Sea. However, this secret would eventually become forgotten over time.

*While knowing she could not make an enemy of the divine, Egeria did not want harm to befall her followers because of the prophecy. She assigned Focalors, one of her Oceanid followers, to be her successor, hoping that she would be able to concoct a plan to deceive Celestia.
*The Fleuvre Cendre, ruled by the outlaw Eduardo Baker, runs afoul of the bureaucracy of the Court of Fontaine; it is raided by the Maison Gardiennage and its leaders arrested. Eduardo is sentenced to exile in the Great Red Sand.
**The Siege of Poisson - While being led to exile, Eduardo is freed by his henchmen and flees to Poisson, taking the Maison Gardiennage personnel who had been escorting him as hostages. Poisson is razed in the ensuing battle between Eduardo's faction and the Gardes, resulting in the deaths of many of its residents. The mayor of Poisson, Renault de Petrichor, likely died in the siege.
**In the aftermath of the siege, Renault's son, Rene de Petrichor, and Eduardo's son, Jakob Jakob Baker, are sent to the Narzissenkreuz Institute, where they befriend Alain Guillotin Alain and Mary-Ann.
The Cataclysm (500 years ago)
Timeline The CataclysmThe Cataclysm (500 years ago)
*500 years ago ― Egeria dies and Focalors takes over. Due to differences in ideology between Egeria and Focalors, the Oceanids refuse to obey Focalors and go on self-imposed exiles from Fontaine.
**The director of the Narzissenkreuz Institute, Lyris, who was herself an Oceanid, also disappears.
* The great beast Elynas appears in Fontaine, spreading severe pollution to the land and sea. Basil Elton, vice-director of the Institute and former Admiral of the Fontaine Navy, comes out of retirement to fight against the threat. The Fontaine Armada set off for what would be their final battle; for 35 days it pursued Elynas, all the while attracting monsters from the Abyss. After finally catching up to the beast, the armada slammed into him, which destroyed the ship and killed all its crew while also mortally wounding Elynas.
**Elynas eventually dies from his wounds, but maintains his consciousness.
*A massive flood later called the "first diluvian period" (or "first flood period") submerges much of Fontaine, including the Narzissenkreuz Institute. The Institute, now flooded and without a director or vice-director, officially closes; Jakob and Rene are adopted by Karl Ingold, while Alain and Mary-Ann are adopted by Emanuel Guillotin.
**At some unknown point, Alain enrolls into the Institute of Natural Philosophy in pursuit of mechanical research.
Post-Cataclysm (500–100 years ago)
Timeline Post-Cataclysm (500–100 years ago)
*~499 years before the The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur ― Focalors avulses the "humanity" from her divine self, creating Furina. Furina was then instructed by Focalors to publicly take the mantle of the Hydro Archon as a measure towards saving Fontaine from the Prophecy of Fontaine prophecy.
** Focalors then creates and proceeds to seclude herself in the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale, acting as the Oratrice's verdict-giving system. Continual trials to be held in the Opera Epiclese would allow Indemnitium—a form of power derived from people's belief—to be accumulated in the Oratrice,of which Focalors would allot a small amount to power Fontaine. The majority of the remaining power was to be stored and utilized when the people of Fontaine would hold the trial of the Hydro Archon, as stated in the prophecy.
**Masquerade of the Guilty ~499 years later, she was sentenced to death via the Oratrice, and has willingly given up her full authority as the Hydro Archon to the Neuvillette Hydro Dragon Sovereign, thus clears the people of Fontaine from their 'Original Sin', and making them - including Furina - fully human. As the result, the Hydro Archon throne is destroyed - hence there will be no further Hydro Archons and the Oratrice is no longer can be used - and the people of Fontaine can no longer can dissolved by the Primordial Sea water.
** Due to the extreme exhaustion and stress she endured for the last 499 years, Furina leaves the Palais Mermonia and Opera Epiclese, where she settles down in an apartment.
*? years ago
**Karl, Rene, and Jakob explore the Khaenri'ahn ruins in Vourukasha Oasis and Madinat al-Nuhas, guided by the Order of Skeptics. During the trip, Jakob's weak constitution caused his health to deteriorate. Unbeknownst to Karl, Rene went behind his back and used Abyssal power to save Jakob. During this trip, they also deduce the "world-formula" from the records they found in the ruins, predicting a second flood period which would destroy Fontaine in the next few centuries.
**Jakob and Rene return to Fontaine and soon discover Elynas' remains. They begin conducting secret experiments on the remains, namely by having Jakob absorb Elynas' blood. After some time, he became able to survive without eating by subsisting mainly on Elynas' flesh.
** During their research into Elynas, Jakob and Rene bump into their childhood friends Alain and Mary-Ann. They are accepted into the Institute of Natural Philosophy following Alain's recommendation.
***Rene begins recruiting researchers from the Institute of Natural Philosophy into a secret society he has named the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, created to help Fontaine survive the coming apocalypse that he and Jakob had predicted.
***Jakob and Rene conduct a failed experiment to try to save the life of Carter Scherbius, Alain's sickly research assistant who the two had grown close to. However, the experiment goes horribly wrong and Carter is left in a semi-conscious state with the tissues of his body destroyed, leading Alain to cut off ties with them.
**Some time after the split, the Guillotin siblings become members of the Marechaussee Phantom. Alain creates a mechanical assistant prototype and names it Seymour, tasking to always accompany and protect Mary-Ann.
**Lyris returns to Fontaine, although she spends her days alone in the remains of the Narzissenkreuz Institute longing for the past. Rene and Jakob eventually find her and convince her to join the Ordo.
**Rene decides to become "the first subject" of his radical experimentation and have his personality removed, using the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz alongside Lyris' purified essence to dissolve himself into a pure base personality for the gestalt. However, the ritual was a failure, and Rene is almost dissolved completely into the pure waters, only partially saved by Jakob through some unspecified method.
**Jakob takes over as the de-facto leader of the Ordo. During this time, the construction of the Tower of Ipsissimus, the Ordo's base of operations, is finally completed.
***Jakob eventually creates a Hydro Tulpa to store Rene's disembodied consciousness, using Lyris’ essence, Alain's Unlocked "Treasure" pocketwatch and Carter's corrupted remains as the basis for his body. He names the new body "Narzissenkreuz," and the newly reborn Rene returns to leadership at the Ordo.
***Narzissenkreuz then uses what remained of Carter's body to create Caterpillar, a hilichurl endowed with sentience. He also teaches Caterpillar human speech.
**Emanuel Guillotin is assigned to investigate the Ordo. However, he, along with the Champion Duelist Marfisa, are ambushed and absorbed by Narzissenkreuz. From absorbing their memories, Narzissenkreuz learns that the Court of Fontaine is hot on the Ordo's trail.
*~400 years ago - Narzissenkreuz orders Jakob, Caterpillar, and Lyris to enter Elynas' remains, a ploy to draw the attention of the Marechaussee Hunters away from himself. Mary-Ann and Seymour are among those sent to Elynas to arrest the Ordo members.
**During the battle, someone triggers an explosion which causes multiple human casualties and damage to Elynas' remains. Mary-Ann is fatally wounded and, for reasons unknown, has her personality absorbed by Lyris. Seymour is also heavily damaged. Jakob, however, survives the incident.
**The Melusines are born from the wounds in Elynas' remains, caused by the shrapnel of destroyed clockwork meka flying through the air from the explosion and piercing through its body.
**Narzissenkreuz falls into the Primordial Sea hidden beneath the Tower of Ipsissimus.
**Caterpillar is found guilty of being an accessory to Narzissenkreuz's schemes and imprisoned in the Fortress of Meropide.
*~400 years ago - Neuvillette is instated as the Iudex or Chief Justice of the Court of Fontaine.
**The newly appointed Chief Justice of Fontaine brings the Melusines from Elynas into the rest of Fontaine for the first time. However, Fontanians were hesitant to accept Melusines into their society, believing them to be creatures of calamity due to an increase in "strange incidents," coupled with Neuvillette having just been appointed as the Iudex.
**Carole is one of the first Melusines to live among humans in Fontaine. She worked alongside the then-leader of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, Vautrin, in order to foster goodwill and cooperation between the two species, in spite of the distrust towards the Melusines at the time.
**5 years later, Neuvillette awarded Carole and Vautrin with the Medal of Peace for their hard work in developing the relationship between Fontainians and the Melusines. However, not long after, a group of hardliners opposed to Neuvillette, including Thibert and Suavegothe, committed a murder and successfully lured Carole to the crime scene. They then framed her for the murder and incited a crowd of people into ordering her detention, resulting in chaos between the Gardes and the mob. As a result, Carole committed suicide to pacify the situation. Vautrin subsequently became enraged by her needless self-sacrifice and sought revenge on the hardliners, killing them to exact his own form of justice. Neuvillette was likewise upset at the turn of events.
***After being exiled to the Fortress of Meropide, Vautrin became a model prisoner and established the Mutual Aid Society, which used a design similar to Vautrin's Medal of Peace as their badge for the next 400 years.
***400 years later, the Melusine Kiara would have a similar incident where someone threatened her, prompting Neuvillette to personally investigate to ensure an incident would not happen again. Kiara, who was kept inside the Palais Mermonia for her own safety, had a dream where she encountered Carole, who remarked that she was delighted to see the Melusines' dreams of living peacefully with humans come to fruition.
*? years ago - Alain leaves the Marechaussee Phantom and establishes the Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering.
Recent Past (
*~3 years ago ― Callas, the president of Spina di Rosula, is accused of murdering Jacques, a Sinthe seller turned double agent who Callas had been working with behind the scenes to put an end to the Sinthe trade. In actuality, an unknown assassin hired by Marcel (Fontaine) Marcel had shot and killed Jacques, and was in turn killed by Callas. Marcel then dissolved the assassin's body with water from the Primordial Sea, erasing any evidence that would have exonerated Callas.
**Rather than risk Navia's safety by testifying agains the Sinthe producers in court and provoking them, Callas chose to maintain his innocence through a duel rather than go through a trial. Before dying at the hands of Clorinde, he told her to take care of Navia, a final request which she accepted.

<title>Layla/Lore</title>
<text>A Rtawahist student who always looks sleep-deprived. Her dark eye circles have been worsening due to academic stress.Yet no matter how difficult the work at hand, she always manages to make the most brilliant deductions. Could she be writing her thesis in her dreams?
Personality
A Rtawahist student who specializes in Theoretical Astrology. Heavily prone to somnambulism and locked in a grinding war with sleep deprivation, the problem of restful slumber is a most troubling one to her.
Due to in part of the Akademiya lifestyle, Layla is highly devoted to her studies, but this has also left her somewhat paranoid and highly sleep deprived, making her very timid and looking like she could collapse from exhaustion at any point. Despite these traits, Layla is unusually perseverant, having outlasted several of her classmates who had joined at the same time as her.
Layla's lack of sleep is to the point that she ends up sleepwalking in the night, where an alternate personality manifests from her. This persona is energetic and determined, helping solve all of her problems (who dubs the present Layla as "Daytime") in an instant. When Layla wakes up, she expresses surprise as to how her papers had been completely finished. She appears to be unaware of her alternate persona, instead believing that she's blessed by the stars.
Appearance
Dreaming Star
Layla uses the Medium Female Characters medium female model. She has fair skin, golden eyes with white pupils, dark blue hair that fades to a lighter shade at the tips, and pointed ears.
Official Introduction
Layla: As night falls, the stars swirl and the moon wanders amidst dreams
"She always says that she's overwhelmed writing her thesis and drawing star charts stresses her out, but she's more resilient than anyone, and refuses to fall behind... Why do I know her so well? Hehe..."
A Rtawahist student, Layla specializes in Theoretical Astrology and draws star charts tirelessly in order to write her thesis.
Due to her teachers' high expectations, her desk is always stacked with a mountain of papers that never seems to decrease no matter how hard she tries.
Having suffered greatly under a severe lack of sleep, stars had begun swirling before her eyes if she so much as stared at her blank manuscript.
This was no way to be - and so she resolved to take a short break, all the better to face reality head-on with a clear mind afterward.
When she woke up, a myriad of stars now adorned her blank manuscript.
Layla rubbed her eyes to make sure she wasn't dreaming. Somehow, the thesis that was due tomorrow was now written clearly upon the pages before her.
Was this a "Thesis That Fell From the Sky"? Or "The Stars' Blessing"? Or could it be... "sleepwalking" - that thing spoken of in legend?
...There was no time to ponder such matters - her next class was about to start.
Character Stories
The Rtawahist Darshan of the Sumeru Akademiya The Six Darshans six Darshans under the Sumeru Akademiya is dedicated to the study of Illuminationism.Each of the Six Darshans focuses on a different field of study. Illuminationism, then, is centered around astrology and astronomy, learning of the cosmos that has clutched the world in its embrace since time immemorial.It is among the researchers of Illuminationism that we find Layla.Though she has only recently enrolled, she has already earned a great many nicknames for herself.She has been called the Sleepwalking Eccentric, the Human Calculator, and even the Heaven-Sent Thesis by those who know her.As the days go by, her titles only seem to grow in number.
There are two kinds of people in the halls of Akademiya:The first holds themselves with an air of calmness and mastery. Be it experimentation or dissertation, this type of person always makes whatever they're doing look easy.The other kind of person wears their woes on their faces. Sighs spill from their lips as mournful notes while they clutch their tools, looking lost. Intermittently, they will jot something down before slashing it out, battling themselves all the way.Layla belongs to the latter category.Being poor of health and bereft of sleep is not uncommon among researchers, but Layla takes it to a whole other level. The bags of exhaustion hanging beneath her eyes and weariness burned across her features make it impossible for her to hide the stress gnawing at her.Should someone approach her, they will often hear her whispering things like "I don't understand," or "why," and even whimpering "I'm doomed." These lamentations often earn her looks of sympathy.The halls of Akademiya exist not just as the altar of knowledge to dedicated students but also as the source of their nightmares. Countless among their number have suffered failed experiments and watched their dissertations get torn apart. Rumor has it that, unable to bear the rigors and pressures of school, many students each year choose to depart before they graduate, quitting before their journey is complete.At first glance, Layla might seem like she hangs on the edge of departing herself, but in actuality, she has already outlasted several classmates who enrolled in the same year as her.When seeking knowledge, talent is useful, but perseverance is essential.
The reasons behind Layla's poor physical health and insomnia can be traced back to a single factor: academic pressure.All students of the Darshans are required to commit to their studies, complete their essays, and pass their examinations or dissertations. Though this task sounds simple, simple does not mean easy, and the investment demanded of students comes in the form of time and effort.Unfortunately for Layla, she is always slower at finishing her papers than her peers.She often spends a great deal of time contemplating, and worrying about the validity of her theses. Is the content overly simplistic compared to that written by her classmates? Are her calculations truly accurate? And if so, are they as concise as they can be?She feels that, as a student of a most prestigious Darshan, she cannot slack in her studies. But at the same time, she dares not commit to her writings in haste.Seized by hesitation, time often slips from between her fingers, and leaves her staring at the blank pages of her work without having written a word.Because of this, she often finds herself working through the night, and leaving sleep for the day. Yet, with the breaking of dawn, she often finds herself assailed by new assignments, causing her to descend into a vicious spiral.As such, her habits have afflicted her body with abnormal side effects.Now, she often rises at night, wandering. Upon waking, she often finds herself unable to remember what she had done or where she had gone - the rumored symptoms of the phenomenon known as "sleepwalking," described by her peers.From how her classmates have described her sleepwalking, it is as if she suddenly manifests with neither hint nor reason in a certain place. Mysteriously, none of them have been able to fully explain where she goes after or what she does either.Besides sleepwalking, she has also discovered another strange recurrence in her life.Each time she awakes from sleepwalking, she finds her unwritten papers from the day before fully completed, meticulous and accurate calculations included! Even the handwriting appears to be hers.Stranger still, the author of her papers also has a habit of viciously critiquing the arguments and experimental methods of others.Layla simply could not fathom herself committing these acts, and found herself suspecting that someone was messing with her.However, upon recalling her experiences leading from her home to the halls of the Darshan, she could think of no one with proper motive.The term "Heaven-Sent Thesis" is often used in Sumeru to describe an impossible miracle... and if what Layla had been experiencing did not count as a "Heaven-Sent Thesis," she didn't know what did.Did a miracle truly grace her? Did the stars themselves, moved by her dedication to the study, repay her with a blessing?Regardless, "The Stars' Blessing" has solved several of her woes. Now, the papers she needs to write for several classes can be handed in without additional worry on her end.As for the other details, well, that is probably best left for when she had the energy to care. Presently, she has classes to prepare for.
After pushing through her heavy backlog of assignments, even Layla will find time to decompress.In her spare time, she enjoys heading to Port Ormos by boat to wander its streets. There, traveling merchants and vagabonds place their stalls and practice their trades, offering all manner of interesting trinkets and showcasing amazing skills, infusing the perpetually exhausted Layla with a sense of refreshment.She has witnessed the folk of the desert testing themselves in thrilling challenges of agility as they score bull's-eyes through distantly placed apples with thrown daggers.She met a strange individual who claimed to be capable of flight; using a mere carpet, they managed to levitate off the ground.Yet, the one who left the deepest impression on her was a stall owner that invited passersby to participate in a game of luck. Upon his stall, he separated colorful pages worth varying rewards into wooden boxes. In a display of astonishing speed and agility, the owner would shift these boxes about and shuttle them from position to position. Afterward, he would ask those participating in his lottery to pick a box.Despite not managing to claim the grand prize during her first few attempts, after a few more tries, Layla began to notice a pattern.Though the stall owner possessed blinding hand speed, she realized that his left thumb barely moved during the shuffling process.Hence, she realized the box nearest to his left them would experience the least amount of deviations to its position.After achieving such comprehension, Layla managed to repeatedly win the grand prize. When the curious stall owner discovered how Layla used her insight to peer beyond the mirage of his speed, he found himself overcome with admiration for the girl and offered her a generous bonus reward.For Layla, the reward was a thing of secondary importance. The true pleasure she got was getting to behold the awesome skills that other people possessed.Unlike the conservatives in the Akademiya, she did not look down upon the arts and trades of those who worked in the streets. Instead, she was thankful to all the vendors of Port Ormos for the happy memories they granted her.
As her first year in the Akademiya came to an end, Layla listed down her strengths and weaknesses, planning to write a personal assessment for herself.She possessed good observation and estimation skills, and was consistently capable of tracking the shifting position of the cosmos via the star charts at twice the speed of her peers.Additionally, she considered her skill in mathematics to be acceptable. When faced with simple questions, she could calculate the answers in a blink of an eye without even needing to do the equations in written form.Before ever entering the halls of Akademiya, Layla had a chance encounter with her future mentor. Her mentor had complimented her then, stating that she was a child blessed by the stars with the thirst and capacity to seek true knowledge.It was these virtues that gave her the courage and hope to seek education and wisdom in the Akademiya.However, upon stepping foot into the Darshan, she found that her strengths were paltry when compared to her peers of a similar age.Only the best of the best could make it into the Darshans, and as such, Layla couldn't help but feel a bit overshadowed.As for shortcomings, Layla found them to be too many to count. For example, her habit of fixating on problems afflicted her with a great deal of indecisiveness.Moreover, her ability to socialize was also lacking. When involved in discussions, she often struck others as aloof and arrogant due to her reluctance in expressing her views, which led to her having few friends in the Darshan.What diminished her confidence even further was the fact that among the many papers she has submitted, few were actually written by her. Instead, they were byproducts of having "The Stars' Blessing."From Layla's perspective, she is an insignificant individual.What she does not know is that her teachers and peers have an entirely different perspective of her."Hey, being mysterious and eccentric comes with being a genius.""How does she draw her star charts so fast while we're doing in-field surveys? Are her eyes kameras? Wait, she's done with the stellar orbits as well?""I have reviewed her papers and calculations and found the work to be rigorous and thorough. Her logic is ironclad. And some of her ideas are so intricate that I, even as an educator, am surprised. We have a fantastic student on our hands."Some people will always tread forward through life weighed down by their caution. Viewing themselves as lacking, they will nevertheless strive on despite the misgivings they have toward themselves.Perhaps it is also this perpetual dissatisfaction that spurs them onward, allowing them to surpass their fellows without even noticing.
There was a girl who was determined, smart, and modest. Maybe even a little too modest.She always felt that her meager gifts placed her leagues away from achieving true mastery.Still, she yearned for excellence, wanting to stand side by side with the greatest of minds, to make her teachers and family proud.Contradictory desires chained her: She was unwilling to let go and unveil her true self, but also did not want to suffer the drudgery of a mundane life.With the passage of time, she felt overwhelmed by a barrage of emotions. Shame. Listlessness. Yearning. All these things weighed upon her psyche and exacted their toll. Eventually, her soul found itself in need of a small outlet. Something to give her some breathing room.While her body and mind are awake and aware, she is too chained by woes to be free. So, it is when she slumbers that her deeper desires come alive to inhabit her vessel instead, indulging in bursts of short-lived freedom, gorging herself on all the expressions and indulgences that she denied herself while awake.While sleepwalking, she is beyond the claws of self-doubt and depression, allowing her to easily overcome things like writing papers, drawing star charts, and making Starlogs. Matters that usually mire her in indecision and worry become simple, allowing her to pour out her innermost insights and challenge highly complex questions.This is the release of her long-held desires. But all dreams must come to an end. As her body wakes, she again returns to being the insecure, introverted girl that she was before. Indeed, after awakening, she can't even fathom that the wittily written papers and intricately calculated equations were created by her own hands.As she is determined and modest while conscious, so too is she sharp and smart while sleepwalking. Both sides belong to the same girl.Like a sapling in growth, she is torn between self-doubt and the desire to break free. This imbalance was how her sleepwalking manifested in the first place. Yet, no matter which side of her is in control at the moment, the part that is Layla always remains.
Besides the hills of notes, star charts, and journals, Layla's desk also has a thick book filled to the brim with photos.No matter what else occupies the space on her desk, her photo book will always take the most visible spot.The photos that fill the pages of this book were personally taken by Layla. It contains pictures of her home and parents, her friends, and even the mentor who inspired her to get into the Akademiya in the first place.Each photo is a snapshot of significance to Layla. She uses these photos in place of a journal, detailing her experiences and trials that led her from her home to the Akademiya.Each time she goes through her collage of photos, she finds herself still able to remember the burning determination from her past and uses it to pierce through encroaching bouts of doubt.Recently, Layla added a new picture she had taken with a certain gold-haired Traveler. As the pictures accumulate one after another, who knows how thick the book might get by the time she finally graduates?
Layla, being a person of easy temperament, rarely gets into arguments with others. One time, however, she broke the norm and found herself engaged in a heated debate.During a discussion for a class on Theoretical Astrology, an esteemed Herbad skimmed over Layla and her classmates' papers, and then began to harshly criticize some of Layla's arguments.In the opinion of the Herbad, Theoretical Astrology is a sacred field of study with laws and theories that have been long crystallized by the expertise of countless researchers across the ages and cemented irrefutably by generations of testing and calculations. For Layla to question and even dare to correct some of these pre-accepted notions was tantamount to blasphemy.Layla did not respond to the criticism in the heat of the moment, however. Instead, she listed her detailed arguments in a report after the seminar and submitted it to the Herbad.Not long after, the Herbad attached his refutation to Layla's report and returned it to her.By this point, most students would choose to accept the status quo. In one respect, failing to get a passing score for their seminar report will result in major negative effects on their finals.Furthermore, it was most presumptuous for a student to argue matters of academic validity with a Herbad, for any Herbad was far more refined than a mere student, whether it be in terms of knowledge and seniority, after all.Perhaps the arguments Layla made questioning long-accepted doctrine were simply results of a miscalculation on her part, and she might have been humiliated in the end on account of being mistaken.Even so, she did not give up. She continued her discourse with the Herbad using her reports. Then, with the passing of half a year, the Herbad went to find Layla once more. He admitted then that after consulting more researchers, he had discovered a point of non-acceptability in the long-accepted doctrines that had been left unexamined by the broader community.As he concluded his explanations, he told Layla with pride and emotion that the students who dared challenge him for the sake of knowledge have grown fewer by the year.The inception of education, for student or Herbad alike, is to seek knowledge in its purest form. Layla, in her persistence, had reminded him, at length, of this pursuit of enlightenment.After the conclusion of the seminars, as Layla was going through the bag that held the documents she had accrued during her exchanges with the Herbad, she spontaneously discovered a gleaming Vision in the bag's depths.It lay there upon a thick stack of notes, like a fallen star pressed into the pages.

Story
History
Alice became acquainted with the Khaenri'ahn alchemist Rhinedottir at an unknown point in the past, along with other witches in Hexenzirkel. The two have a close enough bond that Rhinedottir later sent Albedo, her apprentice and creation, to seek Alice out for help with his final assignment. Alice, in turn, brought him to the Knights of Favonius in Mondstadt, believing they had the resources to build a large research lab for him.
Alice became acquainted with Yae Miko at some point, calling the over 500-year-old kitsune a "little girl" and recounts in the Inazuma edition of the 'Teyvat Travel Guide' how easy it was to make Miko cry. Alice also mentions Asase Hibiki as "that killjoy shrine maiden" and Neko as "that fat cat," further indicating that she traveled to Inazuma after the cataclysm 500 years ago.Teyvat Travel Guide
Fifty years ago, Alice made a pact with her friend and rival, Barbeloth, resulting in Alice taking possession of her diary,Astrology and the 50-Year Pact which Alice in turn eventually left in Klee's care.
At some point in time, Alice met Klee's father, another renowned adventurer, during her travels. They had Klee, and decided to stay in Mondstadt for a while to raise her. Around this time, Albedo sought her out at Rhinedottir's behest, leading Alice to take the boy in and insist on treating each other as a "real family," further insisting that Albedo refer to her as "mother." Alice also imparted Barbara with the "Idol Magazine," inspiring the young deaconess to become an "idol" for Alice's "Teyvat Idols!" group, although the group never came to fruition due to recruitment troubles.
Alice also met Dori at some point and became her first supplier. Dori always speaks highly of her and is surprisingly generous when it comes to sending Mora back to her. On the other hand, Alice also values Dori highly, such as when she narrated Dori's Collected Miscellany, and one of her self-proclaimed titles is "Supplier to the Renowned Lord Sangemah Bay."YouTube:
Sometime after Crepus died four years before the game's start, Klee noticed Diluc's disappearance, which prompted Alice to look into the matter. After finding out about Crepus' passing, Alice sent Diluc a lengthy letter to express her condolences and give him words of encouragement.All's Well That Ends Well (Quest) note=A Tidily Written Letter Three years before the game's start, Alice and Klee's father went to travel "somewhere dangerous and far away," and entrusted Klee to Albedo and the Knights of Favonius.
Alice began writing the Teyvat Travel Guide in the recent past, documenting notable areas and features in her travels, although its highly personal and subjective writing style makes the work read more like her personal diary rather than an actual travel guide. The Mondstadt and Liyue editions began circulating some time ago, as Jifang of the Wanwen Bookhouse claims the Liyue edition has been out-of-print for some time due to its unpopularity.Justice, for Books' Sake
The Mondstadt edition was likely written shortly after Alice's arrival in Mondstadt, before raising Klee. During that time, she observed Amber's Baron Bunny and was inspired to build an explosive doll, which eventually became known as Dodoco. She also became known for performing aerobatic stunts after launching herself with an Anemo Slime, only to receive a Gliding Violation from Jean.Glide With the WindGliding Instruction Manual
While writing the Liyue edition, Alice became acquainted with Zhongli, whom she described as "the sternest person" she knows. She also cured Echo of his stutter, but the potion's side-effects cause him to be compelled to perfectly imitate those around him, which he is still afflicted by to this day.Xinghuo
While the Inazuma edition was first published during the Irodori Festival, its contents set Alice's experiences as occurring shortly before the outbreak of war a year ago. She attempted to recruit Kamisato Ayaka for "Teyvat Idols!" only to be rebuffed at least six times, and befriended Yoimiya.
Present Day
Shortly before the events of Version 1.6, Alice found the Golden Apple Archipelago and thought of Klee. As a gift to her and to the people who were taking care of her, she decided to dress-up the islands, leaving behind various gadgets and games to turn it into a "summer park" for everyone to enjoy. In order to get everyone to come, she concocted a plan of leaving behind threatening letters, encouraging them to go to the island to deal with a fictional enemy, called 'Dodo-King.' However, once the last puzzle was dealt with, the truth was revealed through one of Alice's inventions, which she calls the "Alice Phonograph." She explained herself and the island and that she was already exploring another area in Teyvat.
Sometime later, Alice returned to Mondstadt to visit Klee. During the trip, she ran into Venti and gave him a Dodocommunication Device to give to a friend of his, which he would give to the Traveler.

Profile
Basil Elton was the Admiral of the Fontaine Armada before it was disbanded following a certain incident and her ship, the Sponsian, was wrecked. Afterwards, she chose to retire and was selected to become the Narzissenkreuz Institute's Vice Director, a position granted only to those with "exceptional moral quality and ability." Despite her military background, Basil was a rather easygoing person who was beloved by the children at the Institute. She had a particular knack for making delicious drinks,Heroes' Tea Party and picked up baking during her few years there.Veteran's Visage

In a photo found during the Search in the Algae Sea (Quest), she has dull violet hair and light purple eyes. On her head is a black tricorn lined with gold with the Green Feather Accessory pinned on it.
Story
Basil grew up with Emanuel Guillotin, Karl Ingold, and Dwight Lasker in the Narzissenkreuz Institute, and remained friends with them for the rest of her life, even after the Siege of Poisson. She was a rather poor cook in her youth, as Guillotin silently eyed her with suspicion when she suggested cooking for the group many years later.
Long before Basil became the admiral, she once conquered the Emperor of Fire and Iron that was attacking a ship and Basil sent it back to the depths.Emperor of Fire and Iron
When Basil was Admiral of the navy, Basil's flagship, the Sponsian, was said to be the pride of the Fontaine's Navy. Basil's First Mate, Nathaniel Pickman, was the one who suggested the name of the ship after the name of a historical usurper. Despite initially criticizing the choice as "awful," Basil recanted her position and named the ship after his suggestion, citing that she did not hate the sense of "unreal reality" that it gave.Tidal Shadow
After Basil retired from the Navy, the Armada was disbanded and Basil was selected to become Vice Director of the Narzissenkreuz Institute on account of her perceived high moral character, a decision which an unidentified person jokingly criticized. She often baked for the children there - albeit initially not very well - but grew more proficient at it over the yearsInteractable: Ancient Log Ancient Log  2 Ancient Log  2 and was known for making particularly good refreshments.
Cataclysm and Death
When the cataclysm struck, Director and Basil were each called away from the Narzissenkreuz Institute to help handle the calamity. With predictions that the Institute would flood over for good, and that there was a high chance that neither would return from their duties, Basil sent the children at the Institute to trusted individuals. Mary-Ann and Alain Guillotin were sent to Emanuel Guillotin, while Rene de Petrichor and Jakob went to Karl Ingold.
To fight Elynas, the Sponsian was repaired and the Fontaine Armada departed for what would be their last battle. They followed Elynas for approximately 35 days, while also attracting monsters from the Abyss. While the ship suffered wreckage again, Basil and her crew pushed on.The Lone Phantom Sail
Seeing that their hunt would only become more dangerous, Basil had her Second Mate and most of the crew return to safety, leaving only Basil, Pickman, the Chief Engineer, and those who were willing to stay behind. They fought off the monsters that were on the deck, but a machine operated on the Sponsian showed that there were no chances of survival - a premonition which came true, leading to Basil's death.
The Sponsian was broken in half, with one half on the shore and the other inside Elynas' body.

<title>Freminet/Lore</title>
<text>A taciturn young man and an expert diver, his heart remains as innocent as the fairytales that never cease to absorb him.
Personality
A reserved young man who is well-versed in diving. Beneath his distant, icy demeanor lies a pure heart bereft of all flaws.
Compared to his adoptive siblings Lyney and Lynette, Freminet is introverted, finding it very hard to speak with people he deems talkative, such as Estelle.The City of Rains and Remembrance Freminet enjoys diving, finding the ocean a way to get away from the stress and express his feelings. Freminet has poor self-esteem, as he frequently believes himself to be useless outside of anything other than diving and tinkering with clockworks. He is also notably bad at lying.
He is attached to his mechanical penguin, Pers, who he hopes to modify so that it could fly one day. He also has an attachment to his diving helmet, which he kept even after acquiring his Vision as it allows him to block off outside noise and makes him feel safe.
Appearance
Icy Skin
Freminet uses the Medium Male Characters medium male model. He has gray-blue eyes, dark navy eyelashes, pale, freckled skin, and pale blonde hair. His hair is choppy and neck length. Part of his bangs cover his left eye.
Official Introduction
Version 1
Freminet: Alone under the cold light of stars
Did you see that? As the dove emerged from the hat, the corner of Freminet's mouth turned up very slightly. Imagine how he'd react if we could find a way to make a whole flock of them fly out! After all, as his big brother, it's my duty to make him laugh.
As the realm of Hydro, Fontaine's underwater vistas are positively breathtaking. But not everyone gets to enjoy this mysterious world beneath the waves. Even for those who have mastered the basics, diving can be full of peril to say the least. Among the ranks of able divers, Freminet is renowned for his outstanding professionalism, exceptional ability to stay focused, as well as his abundant maritime knowledge. It's just a shame that, as a classic lone wolf, he never accepts commissions from others.
As the younger brother of Fontaine's famous magical duo Lyney and Lynette, Freminet prefers to stay out of the limelight. Other people's gazes, responses, and comments make him uncomfortable and interrupt the rhythm of his breathing. He prefers instead to slip away and bask in the weightlessness of the ocean, pouring his heart out to a Romaritime Flower.
He looks indifferent, but in fact it's just that his passion never comes back up for air.
Version 2
Freminet: Alone under the cold light of stars
You have two choices before you. You can either wallow in the past until you drown in its miseries... Or you can join hands with your 'family' and open your eyes again.
In his early years, Freminet always preferred to be alone. His unassuming appearance would make people drop their guard, which was something that the House of the Hearth used to their advantage, sending him in behind enemy lines to complete the missions they had assigned him swiftly and without mercy.
"All I have to do is put on my helmet, shut out the background noise, and carry out my orders." Freminet began to see himself as an unfeeling clockwork toy.
It was only later that the House of the Hearth changed into something else entirely. Under "Father's" orders, Freminet joined up with Lyney and Lynette to form their team of three at the Hotel Bouffes d'ete. At first, Freminet often felt at a complete loss.
It was almost as if they could read each other's minds, such was the tacit understanding between the pair of siblings. He felt like a spare part in comparison, worthy only of lying around in some dark corner, accumulating dust.
"Freminet, pay attention! What does this look like to you?"
"A... card with a picture of Pers on it?"
"Hehe, are you sure? It's Pers alright... Here you go, take him! Alright, your task this time is very tricky. I've prepared an especially crucial role for you and this little 'hero'! The plan is as follows..."
Freminet very rarely feels anything when he's carrying out his missions. But when they were celebrating their success, a smile crept onto his face after his first taste of one of the Hotel Debord's delicious desserts.
"Here, have mine too." said Lynette as she filled his cup with tea. "We're family."
Character Stories
Whether you're a tourist visiting Fontaine for the first time or an adventurer who's set their heart on finding legendary treasures, you're sure to be captivated by the enchantments of the underwater world. But those who attempt to explore the depths without first undergoing rigorous training or making the necessary preparations are gambling with their lives. Treacherous underwater currents, unexpected bodily reactions, and monsters lurking in the deep... Peril always comes without knocking. Seeking the help of a professional diver is always a wise choice.If you ask people who's the most talented diver around, you're likely to hear the name of Freminet. Even old veterans, bronzed and toughened by long exposure to the elements, never tire of lauding his skills. They speak not only of his familiarity with Fontaine's complex hydrological systems, but also of his prowess in coping with different underwater environments and seasonal conditions, as well as his expert control over his breathing. He seems to swim wherever he pleases - even through caverns deep down on the ocean floor, where no one else dares to venture...When many people hear this, they suddenly think of something or other that Freminet could do for them. But no matter how great the promised rewards, the veterans always respond the same way – with a shake of the head and a regretful sigh."The boy wouldn't hear of it... He's a nice lad, just a bit too shy."The conversation usually stops here.As Freminet sees it, other people's compliments are as capricious as the weather. He finds it hard to fathom their true intentions, and is constantly worried that he'll put his foot in it by saying something wrong.Perhaps his true friends are the Tidalga and Romaritime Flowers that he spends so much time with. They hold a much dearer place in his heart than do reputation and reward, which float around on the surface. When he dives, he stays silent for long periods of time in the company of his old friends, and lets the silence swallow up his fears and anxieties. In so doing, he lets out all the things weighing on his mind, all the things that he can't say to anyone else.The reason he chose to dive was that simple - to find some peace and quiet, and escape everything happening in the world above.
Even before he received his Vision, Freminet used to love wearing his diving helmet and exploring the underwater world like a penguin.He was never a very talkative child, and whenever something upset him he would plunge into the ocean, leaving his worries on the dry land far above. Over time, the quiet seabed became like a cradle to him, somewhere where he could curl up and feel safe. As the rings of a tree grow outward with each passing year, so too did his curiosity for the underwater world. He listened to the ocean currents with his body, and with each breath grew closer to the water around him. He committed every aspect of Fontaine's hydrology to memory, as if he were memorizing roads around a new home, albeit with far more relish. Eventually, he discovered a place of extraordinary beauty which captured his heart, and built a little secret underwater base nearby. Here, he could let his sunken emotions shine forth with a radiance akin to that of a Lumitoile.To this day, when faced with a particularly thorny problem, Freminet's first thought is to escape to this deep blue sanctuary - so vast and magnanimous that it could embrace all things.Free, tranquil, safe, and content... If Freminet were to tell others how the underwater world makes him feel, he would most probably be met with more than a few raised eyebrows.But Freminet would never do this. In his mind, this is his ocean, and his alone. These feelings, hidden deep in his heart, are like sunken treasures buried in the depths.
In the eyes of an onlooker, Freminet doesn't have much of a presence, and comes across as cold almost to the point of being pessimistic. He's always silent, alone, and doesn't seem to enjoy the company of his peers. Compared to his older brother - the legendary Great Magician Lyney - Freminet seems as dull as a piece of old, soon-to-be-forgotten jewelry. But he doesn't care what they think.A long time ago, Freminet began trying to strip away excess emotions to prevent his being affected by external pressures.As if building an igloo in his heart, he piled up block after block until he had constructed a translucent refuge, and curled up inside. Clutching his knees, the only thing that gave him solace was reading fairytales.If diving underwater was a way to steal a moment of peace, then sealing himself in a sanctuary of solid ice was actually a way to stay warm.Freminet would only ever invite his closest "kin" in, and even then, he'd insist on tidying up first, making sure to lock his fairytales away.By the time Freminet left, he'd already turned into a clockwork toy - exquisitely made, yet silent as ever.He once found himself floating on his back upon the waters, unconcerned with his own safety, listening to the unknown songs of Violetgold Angler Gulls circling overhead. In hindsight, it was fortunate that they hadn't mistaken him for a fish...It was in that moment that he discovered how easy it was to just let the currents carry him away.No matter who was asking, and no matter what they wanted, as long as he followed orders unquestionably without a thought for the consequences - like an angler bringing home their catch - he would no longer have to face the endless cycle of castigation and punishment.In the years that children from ordinary families ran about laughing, showing off the latest clockwork toys or picking up phrases from The Steambird, Freminet's heart was gradually becoming numb. Orders filled the void and became like a clockwork spring driving him forward.He used to fantasize about turning into a cold, cruel machine, driven only by the imperative to execute commands. But as he matured, he became increasingly aware of his essential weakness. He wanted to leave emotions behind, but there were too many feelings that he couldn't just cast aside. They would always come back in the dead of night, suddenly gripping him like seaweed wrapping around his limbs. His habit of avoiding problems, his worry that he would not complete his tasks well, his fear of annoying people with his lack of enthusiasm, and his dread of disappointing others - those who meant something to him, most of all...He wasn't an outstanding child, but he simply became hypersensitive to everything in the world he grew up in.He hid himself within a thick shell and yielded to his timidity, until he could only express himself underwater.
Freminet was born in the Fleuve Cendre region of Fontaine. Each night he would fall asleep to the sound of drunkards belting out off-key shanties, and wake up to the shrill cries of neighbors cursing outside his window.Freminet never met his own father, but he heard from his mother that the man was knee-deep in debt. He had little idea what all these numbers meant, and they were as hard for the little boy to conceive as a dinner in the Palais Mermonia. What he did know was that they were the reason his mother worked from dawn till dusk, day in day out.When he was home alone, Freminet would often quietly fiddle about with the few devices there were in the house - a portable lamp that never lit up, a wall clock that never ticked, and so on...These things had been lying around for as long as he could remember, as if they were guests who had stopped by for a quick rest after a long saunter, but had never woken back up. Freminet found some tools and, one by one, carefully took them apart. To him, the inner structures of these mechanisms were like mysterious labyrinths. Turn this part here, and another would move as a result. Tap that bit there, and something else would spring out...When he was with these machines, Freminet felt the same way he did when he read fairytales - like he had taken a magic potion that shrunk him down to the same size as the components. He was moving through a world of cogs and clockwork parts where time seemed to pass without his knowledge. These friends of his, silent yet intriguing, kept him company through many a lonely day.One day, when his mother returned home, she suddenly heard a strange noise that stopped her in her tracks. It was the sound of their clock, which Freminet had unwittingly fixed, ticking away almost as if to celebrate the new lease on life he had given it. She caressed his head and praised him, filling his heart with joy. But when he woke up the following morning, the clock was nowhere to be found. When his mother came home that evening, she brought him two slices of a type of bread he'd never had before. He still remembers the taste to this day.From that day forth, his mother brought back all kinds of different devices for him - everything from clockwork toys to miniature clocks. Freminet liked his new friends a lot, and would spend a long time "waking" them from their slumber, even though they always vanished the following day.But one day, when Freminet ran over excitedly to greet his mother at the door, he had something very special with him - an exquisitely-made music box pendant, about the size of a person's thumb. It had been in such a terrible state when she had found it by the roadside that it was to their great surprise to discover that it still worked.A beautiful melody jingled away between them, and seeing Freminet's innocent face light up with pure joy, a rare smile broke out on his mother's, too.This pendant would not leave him, for every evening, his mother would carefully take it off her neck, and together they would listen to its sweet lullaby as night fell.
One day, without uttering a word, Freminet's mother took him by the hand and led him away. As he tried to keep up behind her, little Freminet's palm began to hurt from the strength of her grip."Mom, where are we going?" He asked. She didn't reply."Mommy, why are you crying?" He asked her again. She suddenly stopped and let out a sob, but only a single one.Afterwards, as if resolved to plunge into the freezing depths of the ocean, she took several deep breaths and continued onward. Not another tear fell, but in the oppressive silence Freminet had a vague sense that an ominous current was about to crash against the reef of his future.Finally, they arrived in front of an unfamiliar house. As the thick door opened, it let out a harsh creak. It was the type of door that you intuitively knew that, once closed, could never be opened again.Still, his mother remained silent. It was as if her expression, weighed down by her heavy heart, had sunk into a bottomless ocean."Freminet, correct?" Said a woman as she stepped out. "Come with me."Confused, Freminet looked up at his mother. He could feel the tide surging beneath him.Calling herself The Knave (Previous) the "director", the woman took his other wrist and began to pull him in.All of a sudden his mother's grip tightened, becoming even tighter than when she had led him over. Freminet felt like a boat caught between two waves, completely helpless as they each pulled in opposite directions and showed no sign of letting go.At last, his mother slowly bent down, half-kneeling before him. This was what she would do each day when she said goodbye to him before leaving the house."Be a good boy," she said, kissing Freminet on the forehead in the way she always did.These tender words rose up like a barrier before the jagged reef, instantly turning the raging current into a soft, warm flow.So that's all this is, Freminet thought to himself. Perhaps, like ever and always, this was just to be a brief parting after all.He nodded to set her at ease.The director continued to pull him inside, and this time, his mother didn't try to stop her. Just like that, she let go...For a long time after, Freminet truly believed that as long as he behaved and performed well enough, his mother would come to bring him back home. That her kind face, disappearing behind that thick door, would someday reappear. And parting his fringe, she would kiss him on the forehead once again to tell him how well he'd done.But that day never came."Still haven't figured it out? You were sold to settle a debt."As he grew up, Freminet started to have doubts about where his mother had gone and his own fate. After he finally plucked up the courage to ask the director, this was the heartless response she gave him."You were abandoned, child. This is the only home you have." "If you don't follow orders, your mother's safety can't be guaranteed..." Such were the words of the previous director, callous as spiked shackles, locking his wildest hopes inside that door forever. These invisible fetters left a mark of utter abjection on Freminet. In those days, the ocean depths were his sole escape.Engulfed by icy-cold seawater, he always felt that little bit closer to her. After all, when those events had transpired all those years ago, had she not sunk to the bottom of the ocean herself? Yet those waters must have been far colder than any he had ever dived in.
After The Knave "Father" replaced the previous director, Freminet's thoughts began to turn to finding his mother once again.At first, Freminet assumed that she would rile up a still greater storm of brutality, for he knew that her methods were brutal, and he expected new orders to be given just as pitilessly as they had been in the past. But he soon discovered that "Father"'s way of doing things was utterly different.With "Father," the home was a place of refuge for all the family's children, and as such required a collective effort to maintain. It was up to each of them to complete their tasks in the way that best suited them. Even if they failed, they wouldn't be subjected to the searingly painful punishments they had been previously.This taste of freedom finally gave Freminet the chance to breathe deeply, and he started searching for his mother's whereabouts in his free time.But a long time passed and he still wasn't any closer to finding her.Perhaps I really was abandoned, Freminet thought, trying to convince himself to accept reality as he strained to summon the already vague memory of his mother's face.But just as he was thinking of giving up, Father threw him a pendant."I found this at the base of operations of those scum. Keep it." said "Father."Freminet looked back at her, perplexed, which in turn seemed to confuse her."What it is? I'm talking about those usurious scoundrels. It belonged to your mother..." She frowned, suddenly seeming to realize something. "What were you told about her?"Freminet told her what the previous director had said to him, about how he had been abandoned. As he did so, she said nothing, but her eyes began to burn with wrath.After Freminet was finished, Father fell silent for a rare moment. "Do you want to know what really happened?" She asked, fixing him with a piercing stare.Freminet nodded almost unconsciously. But once he had heard what she had to say, he wasn't sure which story he'd rather believe."Father" told Freminet that his mother hadn't abandoned him, but on the contrary, had acted to protect him...That year, the debt that his family owed finally reached the point where they would no longer be able to repay it. Those greedy moneylenders had not only forced Freminet's mother to hand over the house that they lived in, but had also demanded that she hand over Freminet as well. But she was his mother - how could she let this happen? In the end, she had no choice but to entrust Freminet to House of the Hearth "that orphanage" - somewhere they could never get at him - and then face them alone."This was all I found. As for your mother..." As she looked at the young boy in front of her, still gripping the pendant tightly in his hands, "Father" trailed off and left the ensuing silence to speak for her.Freminet's head hung low, but knowing his personality, Father slipped out of the room without another word. The boy was left standing there, shaking as he gazed down at the pendant in his hands. It had long since rusted and could no longer produce sounds, and the clockwork components seemed to have been stained dark brown by dried blood. She must have been holding it at the very end, he thought. In his despair, Freminet continued to stare at the pendant, desperately looking for even a thread of his mother's warmth.That evening, Freminet dived down to the bottom of the ocean and let it all out. He couldn't remember the last time he had cried like this. Other than the Romaritime Flowers that wept alongside him, not a soul heard the sound of his sobbing, for the ocean smothered it utterly.From that day on, his grip on his greatsword tightened. He made an oath to himself that he would never again let another member of his family meet with misfortune.
Freminet has been captivated by fairytales since he was a child.In contrast with the real world, the little world inside a picture book is always full of color. Castles can be made from candy, rivers from the juice of Bulle Fruits, there can be talking Hydro Crystalflies, and Redcrown Finches and ragdolls can become the best of friends...When he closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and then opens a storybook, Freminet is able to dive into a magical fairytale world – a world where he can push the boundaries of what exists through a combination of reading and his own imagination.As he goes, he picks up on scattered phrases or illustrations tucked into the corner of the page and turns these over in his mind. He learns something new every time he reads, and loves the variety of dazzling colors and textures that different subject matters seem to evoke for him....When Freminet starts to feel lonely, "Pers the Penguin" waves to him with his black and white wings and slides around on his round little belly as if it were a skateboard. He skids along the surface of the ice until he plops into the sea, challenging Freminet to a fish-catching competition.When he's feeling timid, "Princess Marcotte" with the long, pink hair stares out at him through the window. He knows that when the princess was but a seed, she rode across the ocean on the claws of a crab, abandoning her birthplace for the promise of a better life...When he's feeling troubled, the inimitable adventurers "Mr Fox and the Clockwork Guardsman" appear there in front of him, standing side-by-side. Mr. Fox's great big bottle-brush of a tail raises a cloud of dust as it sweeps the floor, causing the Clockwork Guardsman's nose to become all itchy, but he keeps standing there, as straight and tall as ever. "Everyone faces challenges," they say to him. "Don't let them win. You're a brave, brave kid."...Even as he matured and grew older, Freminet still stubbornly held on to the fairytale world of his childhood.He truly believes in these beautiful stories and the friends he met in his books.In Freminet's heart, they really do exist in that poetic dreamland of his. There is a place where sadness and worry cease to exist, and all that remains is the unending sound of joyful laughter. It's a place where dreams come true, and justice always triumphs.But of course, he can't actually reach out and touch the things in this imaginary world. Perhaps he'll find a way someday though...
That day, Freminet and some other children were out on an underwater mission. At first, everything went perfectly smoothly, just like it had done on countless other occasions.All of a sudden, however, Freminet noticed that something was off.Creatures that know their own weakness always seem able to stay focused in places of great peril, and Freminet is no exception. He has always been skilled at self-reflection, even to the point of picking up on minute changes in his breathing. Without them even being aware of it, his unique powers of perception have helped them evade all kinds of danger.Freminet made an emergency gesture to his friends telling them to surface. He still didn't know what the actual peril was, but his nerves had taken hold and his heart began to beat faster and faster.His friends didn't object and, with Freminet at their center, the group began to ascend.For these children, who had yet to receive the gods' favor, ascending was something that had to be done slowly. But at the same time, the feeling of unease in Freminet's heart was becoming unbearable. His vision grew hazy, and he couldn't tell whether it was the reflection of some monstrous leviathan or a sign that he was on the verge of fainting.No. Wait. The diving equipment was malfunctioning! Was it just him? If not, how many of the others were affected?He tried hard to open his eyes, but he was gradually and uncontrollably slipping out of consciousness.No, I have to lead them back, he said to himself. As long as my arms and legs keep working...He began to feel sleepy.His thoughts were becoming sluggish... If this carries on, he thought, I'm never going to make it to the surface.Even if I make it, what good would it do? That thought suddenly flashed through Freminet's mind. I'd just go back to living day after day after day, eternally devoid of hope.He felt tired. Tired of forcing himself to keep going.He was unsuited to having so many "family members." There was no real warmth or feelings between them. They were simply a motley crew of clockwork meka, each of a slightly different model and outward appearance.Perhaps the seawater was where he belonged after all. To drift off into blissful sleep... Was it really so bad? He gradually let his eyes fall shut.A sound suddenly jerked him back awake. Freminet... Freminet. The voice was slow, solemn, and seemed to be coming from the other end of the earth. It also carried a slight stutter.Pers?Freminet stretched out his arms to a blank landscape in front of him, opening his eyes in puzzlement.There was no Pers the penguin in this underwater realm. The children had all slipped into a dreadful torpor.I must save them all! Freminet screamed without making a sound. So what if we're not all of the same mind? I won't abandon anyone in my family! No matter what hazards lie ahead, only with the courage to put life itself on the line will I live to see the blue sky that comes after the storm.In that moment, his body seemed to be imbued with power, and even his breathing became grew easy once more. He quickly swam over to his companions, who were each of them drowning...In the midst of a tempest, he saved all of his friends - a miracle of heroism worthy of the legendary Pers from the stories he so loved...It was only then that he realized that a Vision as clear as crystal now hung from his divesuit.He never told a soul what really happened that day. After all, true heroes aren't in it for the recognition.

<text>the current Electro Archon the playable character Raiden Shogun
Raiden Ei ja=雷電影 ja_rm=Raiden Ei, also known by her GoeticBeelzebul, although not in the Ars Goetia, is occasionally an alternate name for the Goetic demon Baal. Additionally, Beelzebul appears to be Ei's equivalent of other gods' Goetic names. As such, Beelzebul will be treated as Ei's Goetic name. name Beelzebul and as the Raiden Shogun, is the God of Eternity and the current Electro Archon among The Seven who presides over Inazuma. She abandoned her body and transferred her consciousness into the Musou Isshin, which is now stored in the Shogun the Shogun puppet.
The previous Electro Archon, Ei's older twin sister Makoto, also known as Baal, died 500 years ago in the cataclysm. Since then, Ei has assumed the Shogunate and continued to rule under the name Baal.
Since Ei cloistered herself to meditate in the Plane of Euthymia, her puppet has been in charge of Inazuman civil affairs. Since the events of Act II of the Imperatrix Umbrosa Chapter, she has decided to relinquish her original idiosyncrasies and work with the puppet, which has its own consciousness, to further Inazuma with a more forward-thinking governance.

Introduction
This body is the noblest and most eminent of all in this world.It should hold absolute control over this world.It once promised its people a dream: the never-changing "eternity."|Beelzebul
Makoto and Ei were twin gods who won the Archon War together. When Makoto established the Shogunate, Ei became her Political decoy 'kagemusha' ja=影武者 ja_tl=shadow warrior, or body double. As far as the world was aware, there was only one god named Baal, the Raiden Shogun of Inazuma.Wishes (Quest)
After Makoto's death, Ei kept herself inside the Plane of Euthymia and let her puppet, the Shogun, control the daily affairs of Inazuma.
Appearance
Raiden Shogun/Lore Appearance
During the Chapter II Prologue, she is depicted as a tachi-wielding woman with long violet-colored hair that was worn down. She wore a kimono which is similar to the one she wears in the present day.
Story
History
Little is known about the history of the twin gods Makoto and Ei. The two gods won the Archon War together, before deciding to "split" - Makoto would serve as the actual ruler of Inazuma, while Ei served as her 'kagemusha', or body double. They governed Inazuma together; Ei was close friends with Sasayuri, Mikoshi Chiyo, Kitsune Saiguu, and Yae Miko. She also met Morax and Barbatos while accompanying Makoto to one of The Seven's occasional reunions in Liyue.
All those who dwelled in the nation lived in peace as long as the Shogunate's borders were not threatened. At some point after creating Watatsumi Island, the god Orobashi attacked Yashiori Island with his followers due to having been sentenced to death by Celestia for reading the book 'Before Sun and Moon', which recorded history that they wanted hidden, as well as paying for Enkanomiya's transgressions. Ei rallied the Shogunate forces against the god and his followers. In the ensuing war, Sasayuri was killed and Ei killed Orobashi with the Musou no Hitotachi on the island with such force that it created the Musoujin Gorge. Neither Ei nor Makoto were aware of the true motive behind Orobashi's attack.
During the cataclysm, the threat of the Abyss prompted Ei to take up arms once more alongside Makoto, Chiyo, and Saiguu. Chiyo was swallowed by a "beast of sin"; while she broke out, she was corrupted by its taint and drew her sword against Ei. In the ensuing fight, Ei sliced off Chiyo's horns and her sword-arm, but did not chase after the corrupted oni. When Ei learned that Makoto had gone to Khaenri'ah alone, she pursued her sister, tasking Saiguu with defending Inazuma. By the time she had arrived, Makoto was already dying, much to Ei's horror, although the former archon was able to preserve some of her consciousness. After returning from Khaenri'ah, Ei assumed her sister's position in both the Shogunate and a member of The Seven. She used the powers of the Sacred Sakura to eliminate all of the monsters plaguing Inazuma, bringing peace back once more, though Saiguu had died in the process. The incident left her deeply scarred from "erosion."
At some point after the cataclysm, through unknown means and with the help of Khaenri'ahn techniques, Ei created an experimental puppet as a proof of concept to see if she could "escape" erosion, who later called himself Scaramouche Kunikuzushi. She had wished to use him to store her Gnosis, but Kunikuzushi shed tears upon creation, causing Ei to believe him to be too gentle for the task. Taking apparent pity on him, she decided to seal his powers and leave him in a slumber in the Narukami Shrine.Husk of Opulent Dreams Later, he arose from that slumber and roamed the Inazuman countryside where he would eventually be discovered by the Fatui and took on the name Scaramouche. She soon had a The Shogun puppet version of herself created, making sure that it followed her ideals. Satisfied with her work, she gave her Gnosis to Miko before removing her consciousness from her body into the Musou Isshin after she made sure she had a way to get out if it was ever required.
This way, her people wouldn't be in danger of transgressing the Heavenly Principles and be punished for it, like Khaenri'ah did, and she herself would survive as their permanent god by preserving her consciousness free of erosion and keeping an indestructible artificial body, so that her people wouldn't suffer the loss she herself experienced when Makoto died.
A year before the game's current events, the Shogun puppet was deceived by the Fatui and allowed the corrupt members of the Tri-Commission, headed by Kujou Takayuki, to enact both the Vision Hunt Decree Vision Hunt and Sakoku Decrees with Ei's tacit approval, shuttering her nation off from the rest of Teyvat. According to Zhongli, the mortal vessel of Morax, she had ordered the Inazuma Shogunate to collect all of the Visions in the country, where they were laid into the Statue of the Omnipresent God for reasons unknown. No one, including her people, has since been granted an Electro Vision.
Present Day
Raiden Shogun/Lore Chapter II
During the Rite of Descension, Morax faked his death to see if Liyue could survive without him. He guessed that Ei would learn of his "death" and retirement, which would cause her to accelerate her plans. Ei, for her part, believed that his story was not over yet.
When the Traveler arrived on Inazuma to speak with Ei, they were instead roped by the resistance to help abolish the Vision Hunt Decree, first encountering her in the Plane of Euthymia when they attempted to intervene after the Shogun apprehended Thoma to take his Vision. In this encounter, she defeated them, but the Traveler managed to escape thanks to Thoma's intervention. While aiding the Watatsumi Army, they are rescued by Miko from Scaramouche, who revealed that the Electro Archon is Ei, who they encountered in the plane; the one in the real world was actually her puppet. She believed that Ei had taken an interest in them and assisted them in reaching her again for a rematch, believing that if they managed to defeat her, she would rescind the Vision Hunt Decree. The Traveler met Ei again on the steps of Tenshukaku when the Shogun attempted to attack the Watatsumi Army, who had arrived to confront her. Drawing on the powers of the seized Visions with Miko's help, they were able to convince Ei to rescind the Vision Hunt Decree, returning all the seized Visions as long as their owners could be found.
After learning of the full extent of the damage dealt to the nation, Ei immediately ordered the arrest of both the Hiiragi Shinsuke Kanjou and Kujou Takayuki Tenryou Commissioners for their deception and started making changes to the Shogun's protocols to fit her new notions of Eternity. However, she had made little progress in doing so as the Shogun was never intended to be changed and that it had begun to see her as an enemy of eternity following her change of mind resulting in it rebelling against her to maintain the eternity she originally sought.
Ei managed to prove that her newfound resolve wasn't a product of erosion to the Shogun in a duel. As part of a new agreement, Ei would no longer rule the nation on the basis of fear of the Heavenly Principles, honoring past sacrifices instead of trying to prevent further loss by overprotecting Inazuma from the dangers of its progress.
Though Shogun becomes her 'kagemusha', Ei vows not to regard her as a mere tool of eternity, just like her sister did with herself, as she began to play a more active role in Inazuma's policies while the people of the nation began to know her as an individual instead of holding onto their unrealistic notion of a permanent and omnipresent god. Both decrees were also abolished, to the delight of many.

Elemental Armor
Elemental Gauge Theory Shields/Enemy
In general, the elemental armor generated by Fatui Skirmishers can be broken using elemental reactions. Each type of elemental armor has a particular elemental weakness, but elemental reactions caused by other elements still deal a small amount of damage to the armor. All Skirmisher Armor except the Geochanter Bracer's use a unique reaction cost coefficient. Compared to other shields, there is a large difference between the gauges required from the most effective element and the gauges required from other elements.

<title>Kitsune Saiguu</title>
<text>The Kitsune Saiguu ja=狐 きつね 斎 さい 宮 ぐう, also known as Lady Saiguu and the Hakushin Kitsune, was a prominent historical figure in Inazuma who was worshipped as a kitsune goddess. She was a descendant of the Hakushin Clan, was a close ally of Ei, alongside the oni Chiyo,Hakushin Ring and served a mentor-like role towards a shrine maiden named Asase Hibiki.Shimenawa's Reminiscence
During a "dark disaster," likely the cataclysm five hundred years ago,Interactable, Pirate's Diary: Pirate's Diary Pirate's Diary  4 Pirate's Diary  4'We shall be like Domeki 500 years ago.'Based on Hamayumi's description, many years after Takamine's disappearance (around which time the Kitsune Saiguu also disappeared), Hibiki lent Domeki her assistance. Based on current knowledge, Hibiki lived a normal human lifespan; thus, Saiguu's disappearance occurred within that general time frame as well. the Kitsune Saiguu was among those who disappeared.Regarding the "dark disaster" and the cataclysm: When Hibiki recounts Takamine the Mistsplitter's and the Kitsune Saiguu's disappearances in Shimenawa's Reminiscence Shaft of Remembrance Shaft of Remembrance's description, she also mentions "Nagamasa joined the Shogunate to clear the Mikoshi name."Through the descriptions of Katsuragikiri Nagamasa and Mask of the Kijin, it is evident that Nagamasa's adoptive mother was Chiyo, who was "swallowed whole by a beast of sin" when she "fought against the abyss." Though she broke free and slew the beast, she was "stained by a deep sin" and "steeped in darkness as far as the eye could see," causing her to turn on Ei. Similar wording is used in regards to Tartaglia Lore Character Story 4 Tartaglia, who wound up in the Abyss and, "within that darkness," learned his fighting techniques and underwent a drastic personality change.Given that Chiyo's corruption (and by extension Saiguu's disappearance) and Domeki's rebellion happened within Hibiki's lifetime, this puts both events within the realm of 500 years ago. According to Chunk of Aerosiderite, a surge of "endless dark monsters with alien, dark blood" occurred during the fall of Khaenri'ah. In We Will Be Reunited, Dainsleif explains that Khaenri'ah fell 500 years ago, making it extremely likely that the "dark disaster" is another term for the cataclysm. She was consumed by a "dark will," and both her body and memories were broken down and turned into filth.Yougou Cleansing
The Hakushin Ring catalyst is narrated from her perspective and its blueprint is rewarded after completing the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual, which is related to her.
Profile
The Kitsune Saiguu was one of Hakushin's descendants and dwelt in the Grand Narukami Shrine. Like all kitsune, Saiguu had a longer lifespan than most humans, but it is unknown how long she lived before her death.
Appearance
The Kitsune Saiguu had white hair and fur.Tanuki-Bayashi in the Forest As shown in Raiden Shogun's character teaser, her wardrobe consists of the typical Miko priestess.
Story
Little is currently known about the Kitsune Saiguu's early life. She was familiar with the oni Mikoshi Chiyo Chiyo, complimenting her beauty and her sword skills. At some point, she won a race against Reizenbou, the Chieftain of the Yougou Tengu. Saiguu believed the Tengu was going easy on her, however, to her slight ire. Afterwards, Reizenbou opted to become her protector.
She often competed with the bake-danuki Ioroi, showing up to stop him from causing mischief. At one point, she tricked him into submitting to the Raiden Shogun by challenging Ioroi to pick a Naku Weed from the Tenshukaku garden, during which he was caught by Ei. She then tricked (convinced) Ei to spare Ioroi's life and take him under her command instead as the "Protector of the Grove."Ioroi She also secretly learned some of the bake-danuki's magic.
500 Years Ago and Death
Do not be blinded. Do not waver. Keep walking the path that you believe in.
Around five hundred years ago, the Kitsune Saiguu became familiar with a certain group of mortals whom she unexpectedly ended up befriending. Included among them were a "shrine maiden" (Asase Hibiki), an "easygoing young man" (possibly Kamuna Harunosuke),Ioroi's recollection of the onmyouji who sealed him gives the impression that the man had an easygoing personality; Hanachirusato later identifies him as Harunosuke. Hibiki reveals that sometime after Saiguu's disappearance and Ioroi's sealing, Harunosuke left Inazuma entirely. a "Kanjou" (Hiiragi Hiroshi), and a "clan who used ingenious techniques to make man-made meteors bloom in the skies" (the Naganohara Family). She doted heavily on the young Yae Miko, who arrived at the Grand Narukami Shrine shortly before the cataclysm. She was also friends with the kitsune Urakusai, author of the original 'New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune Chronicles of the Six Kitsune', due to his literary talents and tea expertise. However, he is said to have made a "mistake" which led the Kitsune Saiguu to banish him, and which possibly contributed to the cataclysm's effects in Inazuma. Afterwards, the Saiguu moved from the Grand Narukami Shrine to Tenshukaku, warning that danger would soon come.New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune</text>

<title>Guizhong Ballista</title>
<text>The Guizhong Ballista is an ancient crossbow-type weapon constructed by the late God of Dust, GuizhongStone Tablet Compilations - Vol. I and the adepti, Cloud Retainer among them,Turning Point to protect Liyue against dangerous foes.Guizhong (Quest) It can function autonomously, firing at any perceived threats nearby, even Treasure Hoarders who try to get close to the ruins.
History
The Guizhong Ballista was initially designed by Guizhong under the name, "Obscuro Vulpes Mechanism." At the time, Rex Lapis judged it to be superior to Cloud Retainer's mechanical creation. Despite conflicts between Guizhong and Cloud Retainer over their ideals, after Guizhong perished in the Archon War, Cloud Retainer made finishing touches to the Ballista in honor of her memory.A Single Harmony for an Irreplaceable Soul
Story
In exchange for Everlasting Incense, the Traveler, Paimon, and Zhongli agree to hunt down a "legendary adeptibeast" known as the Cocogoat for Qiqi. Hoping to use the Guizhong Ballista's power to seek out such a creature, they arrive only to find it broken and in disrepair. After gathering the Guizhong Ballista Maintenance Materials, Zhongli repairs the mechanism. While using it, however, a search for the Cocogoat not only fails to find any such beast, but also raises the ire of the Treasure Hoarders led by Freckle Huang, who broke the Ballista in order to get to the treasure hidden in the ruins. After defeating the Treasure Hoarders, they leave the Ballista empty-handed.
While seeking a way to reach the Jade Chamber, the Traveler and Paimon return to the Ballista. After discovering that the Ballista had been mysteriously repaired in a single day, the Liyue Qixing stationed the Millelith around it while this incident is being investigated. Paimon gets into an argument with the Millelith there, forcing the Traveler to fight them off until Keqing arrives and puts a stop to the confrontation.
After Tartaglia unleashes the ancient god Osial to threaten Liyue Harbor and draw out Morax, Ningguang summons replica Ballistae at the Jade Chamber to fight against it, with modifications from Cloud Retainer. During the battle, however, the replica Ballistae come under attack by the Fatui Enemies Fatui before being ultimately destroyed by Osial.
The Liyue Qixing soon created more enhanced versions of the ballistae for use against Beisht after Ningguang was alerted to its presence by Beidou. Set up on one of the smallest southern islands of Guyun Stone Forest and operated by Millelith soldiers under Keqing's command, these ballistae dealt significant damage to Beisht; while a few were broken in the battle, most of them were left intact. After she fled, they were presumably dismantled and packed.</text>

Dainsleif is a man of mysterious origins but claims to have knowledge of fate itself.
Dainsleif is an enigmatic character, but glimpses of his persona can be captured through the narrations of the Collected Miscellany videos and the Teyvat Chapter Storyline video.
Dainsleif claims that his memory has "all but faded," yet is seemingly able to vividly recall the events of the Cataclysm Fall of Khaenri'ah. Additionally, he is also somehow able to recall many of the events that occurred in Mondstadt from thousands of years ago, including stories of Andrius, the Wolf King of the North and Dvalin, the Dragon of the East.
He appears to be a curious person, questioning how someone as diligent as Jean is able to press on so tenaciously, and insists that he will find the answer to his own inquiry.YouTube:  He also notes how Zhongli's placid attitude towards the fall of Morax as interesting, and wonders if Zhongli could be a player in the Rite of Descension. To his own theory of Zhongli, he persists on waiting, for he does not "lack time."YouTube:  In "Bough Keeper: Dainsleif," his curiosity is all the more evident as he requires three answered questions from the Traveler regarding recent issues concerning mortals and deities, along with 500 Mora, in order for him to become available as an ally of the Traveler during particularly difficult commissions regarding the Abyss Order.
Although Dainsleif detests deities that side with the Seven and dislikes the adepti for signing contracts with Rex Lapis, he has great respect for those who are hard at work, such as Ganyu.YouTube:  He also greatly respects Diluc's unwavering attitude when it comes to protecting Mondstadt, but wonders if his resolve would stay the same if Diluc were to experience the same disaster that he had witnessed himself; the fall of Khaenri'ah.YouTube:
While indifferent to most crises, Dainsleif states that he would not tolerate the dangers posed from his former homeland, as he is only interested in opposing the Abyss Order. Likewise, he is particularly wary of Albedo due to his knowledge on the Art of Khemia, a form of alchemy that brought ruin to Khaenri'ah, and would personally intervene if Albedo made a single mistake with it.YouTube:
During the cataclysm, the Pari Zurvan found Dainsleif in the wilderness and brought him to the Vourukasha Oasis. According to Zurvan, "Half of his body had become that of a monster," and "he was holding a ring tightly in his hand." After his arrival, Dainsleif and Zurvan traveled together and fought off invading monsters from the Abyss. Afterwards, Dainsleif left, accompanied by the Traveler's Sibling.The Hymn of Tir Yazad (Part 2)
At one uncertain point in time, Dainsleif desired to take fate into his own hands.YouTube:
Appearance
Dainsleif is a tall man with light blond hair and sea blue eyes with distinct, star-shaped irises that are common among "pure-blood" Khaenri'ahns, such as Chlothar and presumably Pierro and Kaeya.Destined Encounter Kaeya: [...] I recognize your eyes...Kaeya: You're a pure-blood Khaenri'ahn, aren't you? He wears a mask-like eyepatch covering the right side of his face while still showing his right eye. Dainsleif wears a black jacket with blue details, a gray vest, and black pants along with black armored gloves and boots. He also wears a black cape with a starry, space-patterned interior.
Parts of the right side of his body appear to be covered in a blue veined pattern; namely his right arm, part of his right foot, the upper portion of his right pectoral, and as a faintly visible streak along the right side of his neck. This is more prominent in his artwork that depicts him demonstrating his abilities; in which the glowing veins marble the entire length of a fully blackened right arm, with a similar effect appearing on the foot.
Official Introduction
Dainsleif:"Bough Keeper" - Dainsleif
The confluence between the past and future.
The original calamity had been overturned, yet the island in the sky set the earth to burn. Chalk pursues gold, in this time inopportune, the eclipse is swallowed by the crimson moon. The future must atone for bygone mistakes, as the bond familiar falters and breaks- of the same blood, elders and the youth... Such is the cycle of the world, in truth. Dain, what is that strand of blonde hair to you? Someone you must kill? Or the object of your penitence?

Weak Point Location
New Abilities and Attacks
Elemental Switches
After every use of Primordial Shower, the Primo Geovishap will change into another element. When the Primo Geovishap is low health, it will  perform Scattered Rocks instead of Primordial Shower which will also change the Primo Geovishap's element. The starting element is random, but the order of elements is a fixed loop: Hydro, Electro, Cryo, Pyro, repeat.
Elemental Shards
Returning Abilities and Attacks
*Elemental-Infused Stones: Certain attacks will produce stones that detonate after a few seconds delay, dealing elemental damage of the currently infused element. Although the stones themselves, when created, deal no damage, the explosion(s) that occur do deal damage. Each element has different effects on the stones:
** Pyro-Infused Stones: Leaves a large pool of lava in its wake for a while, dealing continuous Pyro DMG to characters in the affected area.
** Hydro-Infused Stones: Cause seven small eruptions that deal Hydro DMG. Each eruption occurs close to the stone's original position.
**Cryo-Infused Stones: Generates a ring of ice spikes that start from the center of the stone and propagate (up to 3 times) outward, dealing Cryo DMG within a moderate area.
** Electro-Infused Stones: Explodes in an X-like pattern, dealing Electro DMG.
*Punch: Quickly punches at the player.
*Whirlwind: Looks behind itself, then performs a quick spinning attack. This attack is heavily prioritized if any players are behind the Primo Geovishap.
*Slash: Claws in front of itself once.
*Combo Slash: Attack forward twice, and ends with a slam towards the player.
*Burrow: Targets outside Primo Geovishap's melee reach will cause it to submerge underground and dig towards the enemy, creating Elemental-Infused Stones as it travels. It will also damage characters on contact as it bores through the ground. Upon reaching its destination, it resurfaces and performs a slam.
*Scattered Rocks: Raises up its tail and scatter a number of rune-covered rocks around the arena that will explode after a short while, dealing the current type of infused elemental. The attack itself does no damage.
*Elemental Breath: Unleash a breath of pure elemental power, whilst arcing the attack in a cone-like area in front of itself, dealing heavy elemental damage of the currently infused element.
*Primeval Spring: Spawns a barrage of Elemental-Infused stones around itself.
*Primordial Shower: Unleashes a blast of pure elemental power in a huge AoE around it, dealing immense elemental damage of the currently infused element. Primordial Shower will not be performed once Primo Geovishap reaches critical health (Approximately less than 10% Max HP) and will instead perform Primeval Spring.
Descriptions
Even in its long dreams, it would constantly draw energy from the ley lines, perhaps waiting for the day to come where it could rise to meet the sun once more and unleash its long-festering fury, shattering rocks and tearing mountains asunder.</text>

<title>The Wingalet</title>
<text>The Wingalet is a ship located inside the Fortress of Meropide. It made its first quest-exclusive appearance in the Archon Quest Secret Keepers and Forbidden Zones in Chapter IV: Act IV: - Cataclysm's Quickening, and a second quest-exclusive appearance in Chapter IV: Act V: - Masquerade of the Guilty.
The ship currently lies hidden in a production zone of the Fortress of Meropide.
Story
Years prior to the Traveler's arrival in the Fortress of Meropide, its administrator Wriothesley speculates that the Primordial Sea is right below the Fortress. To ensure that Fontainians can reach safety from the Primordial Sea as well as having "something to hold on" to cope with the "impending disaster", Wriothesley launches a secret project of building a ship inspired by the Fortuna, the Wingalet, with some guidance from researchers Jurieu and Lourvine of the Fontaine Research Institute. A factory worth of "labour, materials and technology" was also required in the project. He is determined to finish it even if it might prove futile in the end.
After sharing this information later with the Traveler and Paimon, Wriothesley further adds on that should the workers find out the "truth" behind the Fortuna, "riots" will break out and put the Fortress of Meropide at risk. Although Wriothesley is not concerned with the Traveler sharing what they just saw to Lyney, Lynette, and Freminet, he warned them that whatever action they decide to take will likely affect them.
When the nation is flooded and the Prophecy of Fontaine came true, the Wingalet finally emerges to the surface and saves the people who got caught in the water, with Wriothesley commanding it. After the prophecy was averted and Fontaine returned to normal, the Wingalet returns to the factory in the Fortress of Meropide.The Opera of Noirceur and BlancheurFinale</text>

<title>Fishing</title>
<text>Recently, the Teyvat ecology has seen an increase in fish population, with many new fish species appearing in various waters. The grassroots Fishing Association has its hands full and had to put up a commission for help at the Adventurers' Guild...
Bring your fishing rod, choose the bait, find the spot, cast your rod, reel it in, and voila, a big catch!The fish caught can not only be used to make dishes, but also can be exchanged for precious treasures at the Fishing Association. There's even a chance to catch vibrant ornamental fish to admire at your home!What are you waiting for? Let's become anglers together!
Fishing is a Game System available after unlocking the Serenitea Pot and completing the Exploding Population.
It involves crafting bait to catch different types of fish, with each type only being attracted to one specific bait.
When fishing, players need to cast their line into a body of water. The exact casting spot can be adjusted by the player, and should not be too close to the fish to not scare it away, but close enough to grab its attention. Once the fish bites, the player has to time their reaction and control the line's tension to reel in the fish.
The ripple effect indicating available fishing spots will disappear once all its available fish have been caught, and will return once at least one fish has respawned. New fish will Reset respawn every 72 hours.
Even though adjusting ingame-time does not influence the respawn rate, it should be noted that each fishing spot has a different set of fish for night and day. This means that players can fish twice the amount if a fish can be caught during both day times.
Fish caught can be processed in Cooking to produce Fish as a cooking item, and can also be exchanged for rewards in Fishing Associations of various regions, where the player can notably exchange new fishing rods with different effects.
The Map includes a Fishing Pin 20 Pin that can be used to mark Fishing Points.

Notes
* Fishing forcibly switches the character to the Traveler. As such, if they are currently knocked out, the player will be unable to fish until they are revived.
* Entering a fishing spot (by swimming, using an Alternate Sprint or using the Waverider) will scare all the fish away, replacing the ripple effect with a bubble effect until the fish return a few seconds after the player and Waverider left the spot.
** Additionally, gliding over a fishing spot will scare all the fish away, regardless of vertical distance.
* If there is bait in the proximity of an Ornamental fish, while it is in the jumping animation, the animation does not affect the rate of the fish taking the bait.
** Meaning, you don't have to wait for the fish to finish its animation for it to approach and take your bait. The animation cancels when it takes your bait.
* Although Ornamental fish can appear in either day or night time, the blue glow indicator will only be present at during the time period where the fish can be caught.
** For example, a Fishing Spot containing an Ornamental Dawncatcher will only display the indicator during 18:00 – 6:00, based on in-game time.
* Fishing cannot be started while the character is standing on frozen water, a Geo Construct, performing an idle animation, or in combat.
* All worlds have fish, even worlds whose host has not completed 'Exploding Population'. Other players who have unlocked Fishing can catch their fish if they join their world.
* Extra fish obtained from Thoma's Talent Snap and Swing do not count towards the Achievement Ding Ding Ding!</text>

<title>Yun Jin/Lore</title>
<text>The current director of the Yun-Han Opera Troupe, a renowned Liyue opera singer who is skilled in both playwriting and singing. Her style is one-of-a-kind, exquisite and delicate, much like the person herself.
Personality
quote = A renowned Liyue opera singer who is skilled in both playwriting and singing. Her style is one-of-a-kind, exquisite and delicate, much like the person herself.
Yun Jin is a skilled director, playwright and singer who is well renowned throughout Liyue for her plays, enjoying this passion and going to many lengths to ensure that everyone who watches her performances leaves satisfied. While appearing to be refined and graceful in formal occasions, she is also known to be exceptionally friendly in private. She draws inspiration from many sources for her plays; she enjoys a wide variety of special drinks as one of her pastimes and she can write a play about one if she enjoys it.
Despite enjoying her passion, she also enjoys variety; while she gets along with the troupe in theater-related issues, she frequently clashes with them over personal affairs as she feels that they are too traditional. She is particularly fond of rock 'n' roll, visiting Xinyan and watching her performances at least three times a week no matter how busy she is. Xinyan believes that she comes to visit her due to the finer arts being "suffocating". She tries to keep her visits a secret, as her interest in non-traditional music would cause much consternation among her elders.

Official Introduction
Yun Jin:The opera star's performance is a genteel display of melodious harmony.
One performance by Yun Jin at our tea house rakes in enough Mora that we won't have to open for a whole month!
She is the director of the Yun-Han Opera Troupe and is also a famous figure in Liyue Harbor's opera scene.
Yun Jin is known for her sweet singing voice and intricate costumes, as well as her animated and dynamic performances. Whether it's a delicate and dignified young lady or a mighty and honorable heroine, she can play any role.
What's even rarer is that this young actress is also a playwright. Other than "The Divine Damsel of Devastation", the Yun-Han Opera Troupe has performed many other new plays in recent years, all of which were written by Yun Jin.
However, what is surprising is that Yun Jin, who has always displayed a dignified and elegant image, has a little hobby that is not known to the public - she likes listening to rock 'n' roll.
If you see Yun Jin at a rock 'n' roll performance in Liyue Harbor, please refrain from telling the whole world about it.
Otherwise, she might get nagged by the elders again.
Character Stories
Heyu Tea House has been a popular leisure spot for the people of Liyue.Its business thrives on two things, one of them being its boss Fan Er'ye's business acumen in inviting a top-notch Tea Master Liu Su Tea Master who tells the best stories of all.Besides that, there is also the performance of the acclaimed troupe, Yun-Han Opera Troupe. Its director and soul - a famed opera singer named Yun Jin - takes the stage at the tea house from time to time.While one can always get delicious delicacies or good storytelling as long as one knows where to look, Yun Jin's performance does not just await one there.As a result, you can always find fans of Yun Jin trying their luck at Heyu Tea House. While waiting for Yun Jin's performance, they discuss her past performances and how they feel about them.As such, more people frequent the tea house, with nine out of ten of them being Yun Jin's fans.Fan Er'ye couldn't be more satisfied with this state of affairs.
Liyue Opera is one of the traditional arts of Liyue that has been passed down for generations.Liyue Opera enjoys a long history, and it has gone through quite some changes from what it was originally created to be.The good thing is, the Liyue Opera we see now retains the sophisticated-sounding vocals and richly varied melodies of old.Liyue Opera performers usually perform in troupes, and the most acclaimed one of them is the Yun-Han Opera Troupe.For generations, the troupe has been run by the historic house of Yun, and its current director is a prominent figure in Liyue Harbor - the opera singer Yun Jin.Yun Jin made her name at a young age when she stunned her audience with a sweet voice and lively costumes in her debut performance.The more she performs, the better-honed her animated and dynamic style becomes.Whether it's a delicate and dignified young lady or a mighty and honorable heroine, she can play any role.What's even rarer is that this young actress is also a playwright. Other than "The Divine Damsel of Devastation," the Yun-Han Opera Troupe has performed many other new plays in recent years, all of which were written by Yun Jin.With her superb skill, it is no wonder why long-time opera fans often visit Heyu Tea House to ask about Yun Jin's performance schedule when their starving ears demand good opera singing.
Yun Jin was born in a family of Liyue Opera performers.Her father is a playwright, and her mother used to be a famous opera singer in Liyue Harbor, taking up the mantle from Yun Jin's grandfather.In such an environment, Yun Jin was exposed to Liyue Opera at a very early age, often amusing herself by echoing her mother's singing.A childhood hobby, as many would tend to believe, seems unlikely to be developed into a lifelong career, yet Yun Jin proved to be an exception.She was serious about it and insisted on learning the art.Her parents were delighted to see their daughter's determination and imparted everything they knew about the Liyue Opera to her. As such, Yun Jin started learning the opera early.However, Liyue Opera is a complex art that takes years of perfection to master.So even for a child as gifted as Yun Jin, what awaited her was sweat and tears. While ordinary children might shy away from the pain of hamstring stretches and the tedium of memorizing lyrics, little Yun Jin hung tough and became quite accomplished.By the time she finished all the subjects in Liyue Opera, veterans of Yun-Han Opera Troupe who watched her grow up couldn't help but exclaim,"Yet another rising opera star is about to shine upon Liyue Harbor!"
Many veterans of the Yun-Han Opera Troupe first joined the troupe when Yun Jin's grandfather was in charge.They have remained committed since Yun Jin took the troupe over.Their love for the art of Liyue Opera is so deep - perhaps even to an excessive degree - that they frown upon any other forms of music performance, including rock 'n' roll.Yun Jin, however, thinks otherwise. She finds that rock 'n' roll vibrates with vigor and even became friends with the rock 'n' roll musician Xinyan.Elders of the troupe are glad to follow Yun Jin's lead during rehearsals, but when it comes to daily life, they treat her like their little granddaughter."Sweetie, listen to us. No spicy food, it hurts your voice. Meat is fine, but refrain from eating too much, or you will put on weight.""If you really can't help yourself, have more shrimp. Stay away from the... roll 'n' roll thing. All they know is yelling."These caring elders will nag Yun Jin about attending rock 'n' roll performance for hours on end.Faced with the impossible mission of persuading stubborn granddads and grannies, Yun Jin has to be creative.While it's not an option to go to Xinyan's performance, it's perfectly acceptable to visit Fan Er'ye's adopted daughter Xingyan and discuss Liyue Opera with her.The elders are not fond of the rock star Xinyan, but they have taken a shine to Xingyan the adopted daughter of Fan Er'ye."I've heard that Xingyan can cook and do embroidery. She must be a polite and accomplished young lady. Yun Jin may be able to pick up a thing or two from hanging out with her. How capital!"Yun Jin has long got Fan Er'ye to agree on the details concerning the made-up Xingyan, so don't worry. No one's gonna call her out on this!
Yun Jin goes by many names. To some, she is Director Yun, and to others, Sir Yun.They call her Director Yun for her leadership of the Yun-Han Opera Troupe. Though there are managers to help with everyday work, Yun Jin is the one who makes the big decisions. She thus earned the name of Director Yun from people in business circles.As for Sir Yun, that is another story.When Yun Jin's grandfather was in charge of the Yun-Han Opera Troupe, long-time fans respectfully addressed him as Sir Yun. After Yun Jin took charge later, these fans frequented her performances as well.There was once after a show when an impressed fan half-joked with others, "the Sir Yun we have now sings rather well too."A voice from the crowd immediately countered by saying: "How can you address a young girl as Sir?"Upon hearing this, Yun Jin curved her lips."Those who were born early, learn early. They are naturally better-informed than others. It's every bit right for them to be referred to as Sirs.""But one doesn't have to be old to be knowledgeable. Besides, why can't a girl be knowledgeable?""You are quick in mind and speech, and are thus qualified to be called Sir. I have answered your eminent question - that also makes me a Sir."Her remarks impressed the fans present, who shared this story to many. In the end, everyone followed the trend and started to call her Sir Yun whether they had or had not met her in person.
Many traditional Liyue Operas revolve around the theme of the adepti and Rex Lapis himself.A prime example would be "The Divine Damsel of Devastation." People are full of wonderful fantasies about the adepti and would like to see the representation of their joy and anger on stage. Thus, stories portraying them make up the majority of the repertoire of Liyue Opera.When Yun Jin was young, she would find these stories engaging, but having exhausted every adeptal legend in her performing career, her take on theming gradually changed.Why not experiment with other themes? For instance... stories of our own, perhaps?Stories that tell of our earthly joys and sorrows, songs that sing of the hatreds and passions of humanity.Maybe these stories of mere mortals may not make it as classics of Liyue Opera, but there will always be some people who remember them.In love our thoughts linger, in rage our hearts burn, and in obsession, our minds go astray. These emotions, good or bad, lift the veil that covers our feelings and souls.Yun Jin is no adeptus. She can never put herself in the shoes of the adepti, yet she is endowed with the most accurate and sensitive grasp of human emotions."So, let me sing of human stories. May my brush be the brush of all hearts and my voice the voice of all souls."This is the unspoken wish that Yun Jin has so far only kept to herself.
Her Yun Family ancestors used to work as weaponsmiths instead of opera performers.Later, someone in the family who was tired of weapon forging grew an interest in the performing arts. By the time it came to Yun Jin's generation, few of the Yuns still practiced the art of forging.Many forged things have been passed down, though. The lock-shaped copper pendant that Yun Jin carries with her is one such item.In her childhood, she often practiced dancing for a whole day under the scorching heat of the sun. Sometimes, she would even faint from the exhaustion.Her parents' hearts ached for her, but they knew well that she had to go through such things to lay a solid foundation.So instead of stopping her, they gave Yun Jin the lock in the hopes that it would keep fortune and health within her.Since then, the lock has never left Yun Jin's side. Before every performance, it is a routine for Yun Jin to reminisce about those days of bittersweet training by cleaning the lock with great care.It feels as if she was caressing the devoted heart of the little Yun Jin who was learning the opera.
Shortly after Yun Jin's debut, Yun Jin quickly got the hang of stage performance through dozens of shows and her great intelligence.At the time, her appearance meant a whole night of applause for a performance. However, the more she played, the more she felt at a loss - these were not the operas she wanted to perform.In every opera, the pitch and tempo would invariably go either up or down to indicate drama or doldrum.As time passed by, the visage of the various characters seemed to blend and blur.The music would come on, followed by a neat dance, and then her sweet voice. The girl in "The Divine Damsel of Devastation" seemed no different from the fisherman's daughter in "String of Pearls."While the audience did not object, Yun Jin was not satisfied. "Is skillful singing and dancing all it takes to tell a moving tale?"What broke her bottleneck was an opera named "Snow Treading."It was a monodrama about a strenuous walk in the snow. It happened to be a snowy day when Yun Jin first performed the opera.Having gone astray in the snow, the character felt lost and lamented her helplessness. Somehow, the snow in the story seemed to fall into reality. Yun Jin, who had also found herself adrift, felt as if she had become her character.That was what she had been looking for, the feeling of leaving herself behind and walking in the shoes of the many characters she played.To breathe, to live, and to smile just like them.That was the opera she had wanted to sing, the story she had wanted to tell - one about true emotions, a world built on tens of thousands of individuals who live lives of their own.Yun Jin could no longer recall how she returned backstage after the epiphany. All she knew was that when she finally had time to take off her costume, she found a Vision in her sleeve.

<title>Egeria</title>
<text>Egeria, also known as the Mistress of Many Waters,Splendor of Tranquil WatersLa Chanson d'Erinnyes was the original Hydro ArchonFinale Paimon: Yeah, and in a manner of speaking, Focalors finally managed to fulfill the original Hydro Archon's wish to turn Oceanids into real people, too. and the predecessor of the latest Hydro Archon, Focalors.
Egeria assumed control of Fontaine after the fall of Remuria and the death of its God King, Remus.The History of the Decline and Fall of Remuria She died in battle at Tunigi Hollow during the cataclysm 500 years ago and her body turned into the water of the Amrita. Greater Lord Rukkhadevata grew the Harvisptokhm from the Amrita to anchor Egeria's consciousness to the mortal realm,Vibrant Pinion allowing Egeria to contain and cleanse the Abyssal defilement in the Girdle of the Sands.Pale Fire
Her voice was first heard in ''.
Profile
Egeria became the god of Fontaine after Remus' death, uniting the various tribes that remained after Remuria's destruction. She established Fontaine's laws and was known by various titles, including "Noble Navigator," the "Ruler of Rivers and Seas," and the "Queen of All Waters." Little is currently known about Egeria's reign, although it is believed that she knew about Fontaine's future conundrums; rumors claim that the Prophecy of Fontaine prophecy now spreading around Fontaine - that all Fontainians are born with sin, and that the waters will rise and dissolve the people of Fontaine, leaving only Focalors behind - are rooted in Egeria's last words.When All Return to the Waters In 'The Final Feast', Egeria states: "The original sin is the fairest: Everyone sinks... Make the most of the final feast, because for the sinners, the curtain call has come," although this has not been identified as her last words.
Egeria is the alleged creator of the Oceanids, and although this view has been challenged by later researchers,Interactable, Institute of Natural Philosophy: Institute of Natural Philosophy Ancient Natural History Excerpts Ancient Natural History Excerpts the Oceanids willingly followed Egeria and the strongest of them traveled all over Teyvat to follow Egeria's command of "connect[ing] everyone in the world."Life Flows On (II) Following Egeria's death, many of the Oceanids chose not to return to Fontaine, in part out of a refusal to recognize the new Hydro Archon Focalors, and in part because Fontaine's waters suddenly grew bitter from pain and hate, and finding other sources of pure water was necessary for survival.Idyia With Egeria's death, most of Fontaine's waters are no longer capable of naturally creating Oceanids.Tainted Water-Splitting Phantasm
When the cataclysm struck and the Abyss' power emerged all over Teyvat, Egeria was among the Archons who fought at Tunigi Hollow. After she was slain, her body transformed into the pure, primordial waters of the Amrita, from which Greater Lord Rukkhadevata grew the Harvisptokhm. When even the Amrita began to succumb to the Abyss, Rukkhadevata summoned Simurgh, the Khvarena given to her long beforehand by the late Nabu Malikata, to drink from the Amrita and burst into thousands of motes of Khvarena which would then cleanse the Abyss' defilement. The Pari, who are motes of Khvarena which have sentience, consider the Harvisptokhm their god.The Splendorous Sky That Day
Story
History
An Oceanid legend states that after the Dragon of Water was removed from its position as the "heart" of the Primordial Sea, the Shade of Life, one of the Four Shades of the Primordial One, created Egeria as the Primordial Sea's new heart. Despite the Primordial One's alien origins, Egeria's substance and essence were formed entirely from material originating from Teyvat. At the time, no divine duty had been assigned to her.Wings of Merciful, Wrathful Waters
According to legend, the first Oceanid was born after Egeria shed the "first tear," which then gave birth to all other Oceanids. Egeria bestowed a task to the Oceanids "to seek an understanding of the diverse array of species and to love every creature." The Oceanids, following their master's desire to connect everyone in the world, thus dispersed across the waters of Teyvat to act as spies,The original Chinese term used in 'Life Flows On (II)' is 間諜, which can be translated as either "spy" or "secret agent." the most powerful of whom was Rhodeia of Loch. Despite the usage of the term "spy," however, Endora (NPC) Endora - communicating on Rhodeia's behalf - denies any ulterior motive on Egeria's part.
Egeria's followers soon desired to live on the surface, having seen and envied human life. Not wanting to refuse her followers, Egeria decided to fulfill the request herself, taking water from the Primordial Sea and inserting it into the Oceanids' "blood" vessels, thus creating humanoid forms for them to walk on land. This act of "life" did not go unnoticed by Celestia, who deemed it a sin and sentenced her to be sealed for her crimes, claiming that a prophecy would come to dissolve the people of Fontaine back into their original forms.
After Remuria was destroyed by conflicts and rebellions, Celestia commanded Egeria to return from her primeval prison to take over Remus' position and rule Fontaine.page=Splendor of Tranquil Waters Egeria returned to Fontaine and gathered the survivors, mediated between their feuds, and instructed them to establish new cities around flowing springs, thus commencing an era guided by law which has endured to the present day.The History of the Decline and Fall of Remuria She was awarded a Gnosis, ascended as the Hydro Archon, and became one of The Seven.
She exiled all of the criminals from her nation, who lived in misery as they were shunned by society. Eventually, some of these criminals begged for forgiveness, which she heard through the waters. Egeria granted their wish for redemption, ordering them to guard her secret beneath the waves, which they did. This resulted in the construction of the Fortress of Meropide, a living place for them, with its main purpose to stop the path leading to the Primordial Sea, though this was eventually forgotten over time.
While knowing she could not make an enemy of the divine, Egeria did not want harm to befall her followers because of the prophecy. She assigned Focalors, one of her Oceanid followers, to be her successor, hoping that she would be able to concoct a plan to deceive Celestia.The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur
The Cataclysm
Five hundred years prior to the events of the main story, the cataclysm began. Egeria was among several gods who ventured to Tunigi Hollow to combat the forces of the Abyss spewing forth from the rift there. However, she was eventually slain during the conflict, and her body was subsequently turned into a pool of pure dew called the Amrita Pool Amrita.
As Egeria had been stained by corruption and unable to be reborn in a purer plane, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata grew the Harvisptokhm from the Amrita, allowing Egeria's consciousness to remain anchored to the mortal realm by dwelling within the Gaokerena, a giant lotus within the Harvisptokhm.The Hymn of Tir Yazad (Part 1) The power of the Harvisptokhm would maintain the seal and absorb the defilement at Tunigi Hollow, keeping the Abyss at bay for years to come while the Amrita nourished the Vourukasha Oasis around the Harvisptokhm.
Eventually, as the corruption of the defilement began taking its toll on the Harvisptokhm, a Khvarena bird named Simurgh was forced to make her destined sacrifice by drinking the water of the Amrita and transmuting herself into limitless Khvarena lifeforms. This resulted in the creation of the sentient Pari and other Khvarena forms, who began to defend and worship the Harvisptokhm as their god.
Legacy
Following Egeria's passing, she was succeeded as Hydro Archon by Focalors. However, the Oceanids, who worshipped Egeria and refused to recognize Focalors as the new Hydro Archon, ventured to the Harvisptokhm in search of their master.Pale Fire (Quest) Upon discovering what remained of their former god, the Oceanids spread across Teyvat to continue their former god's wish in exile.Rhodeia of Loch Since then, many of the Oceanids have cut all ties with Fontaine.
Over 400 years ago, Rene de Petrichor, Jakob, and Karl Ingold traveled to the Girdle of the Sands in hopes of finding a way to avert Fontaine's impending water crisis. There, Rene discovered that his and Jakob's physical constitutions were similar to the Gaokerena's, but Karl's was not.Rene's Investigation Notes
Present Day
Centuries later, massive defilement build-up - which was not ritually cleansed by the Order of Skeptics, who had lost their connection to the Pari - caused the Sign of Apaosha to form over the Harvisptokhm, threatening to erode it. During the Khvarena of Good and Evil, the Pari Sorush teams up with the Traveler and Paimon to purify the defilement and awaken Egeria's consciousness. With help from Mihir and Rashnu, the trio perform the Rite of Chinvat at Tunigi Hollow to gain access into the Harvisptokhm.
.]]
Inside the tree, the trio traverse through various Defiled Chambers within Egeria's consciousness to extract several Spenta Hearts within them. With the hearts, the trio perform the Rite of Ab-Zohr to bloom the Flower of Sanctity within the Gaokerena and awaken Egeria's consciousness, which then unleashes Amrita across the land to rid it of its defilement, extinguishing the Sign of Apaosha and allowing the withered Harvisptokhm to regrow.The Hymn of Tir Yazad (Part 2)
When the Traveler and Paimon arrive in Fontaine, they learn that a prophecy has recently been circulating around Fontaine: That all people from Fontaine are born with sin that cannot be absolved; one day, the waters of Fontaine will rise and the sinful people will all be dissolved into the waters, and only the Hydro Archon will remain, weeping on her throne - only then will the sins of the people be washed away. Neuvillette speculates that it is rooted in Egeria's last words before her death, believing that it is the "conundrum" she left behind for her successor.

<title>Istaroth</title>
<text>Istaroth is a god with control over time and wind,The Byakuyakoku Collection and is likely one of the four shining shades of the Primordial One.In 'Before Sun and Moon', the author states that the Primordial One and its "three other shining shades" did not hear the people's lamentations, and leaves the fourth shining shade from "When the Doves Held Branches" unaccounted for. Later, they call Istaroth the only one who had not forsaken them, which makes her the fourth shade. She is known by a plethora of titles, including the God of Moments, the God of Time (alternatively, 'Master of Time' or 'Ruler of Time'),Weapon Series Lore: Sacrificial Series Kairos, the Thousand Winds of Time (or simply 'the Thousand Winds'),The Byakuyakoku Collection the Undying Wind, and Tokoyo Ookami.The Byakuyakoku Collection
She has been worshipped in Mondstadt and Enkanomiya both before and concurrently with the rise of The Seven.Time and Wind However, the worship of Istaroth or even the knowledge of her existence has been all but forgotten in Teyvat, though her legacy has been subtly preserved through phrases related to "the winds of time."SayidRagged Notebook (Time and Wind) The Enkanomiyans continued to worship her after their island sunk beneath the surface world, seeing her as the only one who had not forsaken them. Later, this worship faded following Orobashi's appearance, and disappeared completely after the move to Watatsumi Island.
Profile
Introduction
Seeds of stories, brought by the wind and cultivated by time. Stories brought on the wind will bloom into legends in due time.We knew the only one who had not forsaken us as the "Ruler of Time." She was the moment. She was every moment. She was the measure of a thousand winds and the sun and the moon. She was every second of joy, every moment of rage, every instant of longing, every minute of obsession. She was every flash of delirium.
Story
History
After the arrival of the first throne of the heavens, the Primordial One appeared and fought against the Seven Sovereigns of the old world. To that end, it created four shining shades of itself, one of which was likely Istaroth. 40 years after the Primordial One's appearance, the Seven Sovereigns were vanquished and the seven nations submitted to its authority. Istaroth may have contributed to the new world the Primordial One made.
Following the arrival of the Second Who Came and the catastrophe that followed, Istaroth presumably participated in the war on the Primordial One's side against the Second Who Came. In the midst of the massive destruction, the land of Enkanomiya sank below the waters and was cut off from Teyvat.
In Mondstadt
Istaroth's direct role in Mondstadt's history is currently unknown, but in the early days of Barbatos' Mondstadt, she was worshipped alongside the Anemo Archon himself.
Barbatos amassed power during the Archon War as a result of the Gunnhildr Clan's worship of him, and he later participated in the rebellion against Decarabian.Biography of Gunnhildr Before he gained power, he was a "single thread of the thousand winds that roared through the northern lands," an elemental spirit without any divine power. Istaroth herself is known as the "thousand winds," but no direct relation between the two has explicitly been made.
After the fall of Decarabian's Mondstadt, Barbatos ascended to godhood and became the Anemo Archon. During the formation of the new Mondstadt, at least three of its prominent clans - the Gunnhildr Clan, the Imunlaukr Clan, and the Lawrence Clan - all worshipped both the Anemo Archon and the God of Time. The worship of both gods was primarily conducted on a tall clifftop facing the eastern sea, likely at the Thousand Winds Temple which shares its name with one of Istaroth's epithets.
Somewhat ironically, Istaroth was forgotten over time and people came to believe that Barbatos was the sole deity of worship in Mondstadt. Two notable incidents may have contributed to loss of information pertaining to Istaroth: During the Mondstadt Aristocracy's corrupt period, the Lawrence Clan suppressed knowledge about Mondstadt's history and destroyed historical records and relics to hide their own degeneracy.Royal Grimoire After the fall of the aristocracy, the Mondstadt Library - once the largest library in northern Teyvat - was reduced to a sixth of its former size following the Great Fire of Fall Equinox.Favonius Codex
In Inazuma
Ei believes that Istaroth may have assisted Makoto, with or without her knowledge, in manipulating time to plant the Sacred Sakura, as both her and Yae Miko were unconvinced that Makoto would be able to do so herself.Radiant Sakura
In Enkanomiya
After Enkanomiya fell into the depths, their pleas and prayers went unanswered by the Primordial One and its other three shades. Only Istaroth continued to answer them, and there were "scribes of Tokoyo Ookami" who dedicated themselves to recording history and the passage of time in the lightless land. Out of reverence for her, her worshippers refused to say her name directly and usually opted to call her Kairos, her traditional name, or its Narukami-style rendering, Tokoyo Ookami. In the event that they used her true, secret name, they wrote it backwards.
Istaroth's power of "undying wind" was recognized as one of the major elements in Enkanomiya, along with the Bathysmal Vishaps' "water."
Enkanomiyans practiced the Sentou Ceremony, which was capable of dispelling the abyssal Void Realm's darkness by gathering light in the Bokuso Box,Three Realms Gateway Offering: The Eve and the Light Realm Sigils used to upgrade it are said to bear a mark symbolizing Tokoyo Ookami's recognition. Both the box and the ceremony only work in Enkanomiya and were not brought to Watatsumi Island, although both are rediscovered and utilized during the 'Three Realms Gateway Offering' event.
Legacy
In Mondstadt, Istaroth's legacy has been preserved primarily through the phrase "winds of time." The carvings on the sundials at the Thousand Winds Temple and the Nameless Island leave messages associated with both her and Barbatos which respectively read:
'"Seeds of stories, brought by the wind and cultivated by time."Stories brought on the wind will bloom into legends in due time."'
During the quest 'Time and Wind', a faint voice is heard saying '"An ancient tale comes whisked in the wind... In time, it will grow and sprout once again..."' while fighting an Eye of the Storm by the Sundial near the Thousand Winds Temple.
The Sumeru scholar Sayid, while visiting the Mondstadt Library during nighttime, recites a truncated version of the phrases inscribed on the sundials: '"Seeds brought on the wind will sprout in due time..."'
In Old Mondstadt fairytales surrounding Sal Vindagnyr and the area of Dragonspine, the "Wind of Time" had abandoned the mountain and left the winds to freeze it over in its moment of destruction.Diary of Roald the Adventurer Roald does not specify whether "Old Mondstadt" refers to Decarabian's Mondstadt or the Mondstadt Aristocracy, making it difficult to determine the origin of these fairytales.
One of the incidents that reinforced Ei's belief in the inextricable link between progress and loss is referred to in the format of "the winds of time": 'The winds of parting came whistling in from the outer edge of time.' This phrase comes after references to incidents in Khaenri'ah and Liyue, indicating that the phrase relates to Mondstadt.
Hilichurls may also have a connection to Istaroth and the Primordial One. Jacob Musk believes that hilichurls worship elemental power itself, giving the example that hilichurls worship the power of Anemo rather than the Anemo Archon,Hilichurl Cultural Customs and there is a notable cloister of hilichurls dancing around the Sundial by the Thousand Winds Temple that the Traveler may be commissioned to exterminate.Crisis of Shields According to people from Enkanomiya, Istaroth is the personification of undying wind, and her name is sometimes rendered as the "thousand winds of time." Furthermore, the Musk Family's research has indicated that the Hilichurlian word "Unu," which means "one," is also a holy word which they use to refer to gods.Handy Handbook of Hilichurlian Altogether, this points towards a connection between hilichurls, the Primordial One and its shining shades, and the unified human civilization that once existed (which Enkanomiya was originally part of).
During 'The Final Chapter' World Quest, The Aranara, Aranaga gifts the Traveler a flower which they describe as being unable to be destroyed by the "Ad Oblivione", a title they later clarify to be "the wind that flows forever, the thousand winds that return to one."The Final Chapter This is very likely to be referring to Istaroth, as her titles include "The Thousand Winds", the "Undying Wind", and similar.

<title>Akasha System</title>
<text>The Akasha System was developed by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata by using her Gnosis and expanded on by Sumeru Akademiya after her death. It allows for the transfer and sharing of information via a device called the Akasha Terminal that is powered by the Dendro Archon's Gnosis.
Background
The Akasha Terminal is a unique piece of Sumeru technology invented by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata and further developed by the Akademiya.Where the Boat of Consciousness LiesSilent Seeker of Knowledge It takes the shape of an earpiece. It is capable of granting the user any sort of knowledge they desire to have, as long as they have the required credentials. Although this device can be used anywhere within the borders of Sumeru, its potency is best achieved in larger settlements such as Port Ormos or Sumeru City. Everyone who arrives at Sumeru City is provided with one, the Traveler and Paimon included. In order to activate the device, the user must hold it in their hand and say the phrase "May the Mighty God bless us with their voice of wisdom." Upon uttering this phrase, the device will instantly activate and be available for use.The Trail of the God of Wisdom Aside from travelers and outlanders, it is also utilized by the majority of Sumeru's population. However, because of the old prejudice between the Desert and Rainforest people, when people originating from the Desert come to Sumeru City, they are automatically given lower clearance than people from the City no matter what their job is.
Prolonged use of the Akasha System and Canned Knowledge carries great risks: firstly, the knowledge asserts itself as true to the user and is difficult to forget, which makes it difficult to correct if the knowledge turns out to be wrong, and secondly, excessive use diminishes one's ability to think.Suspicious Smuggling Case Even experienced users have had difficulty perceiving the world accurately when the Akasha already funneled knowledge into them, as seen by Grand Sage Azar when he went to check Lesser Lord Kusanali's status.Jnagarbha Day
The Akasha Terminal is capable of harvesting the Jnana Energy of Sumeru's people, and is the reason people in Sumeru do not dream.The Empty Illusions of the Sabzeruz Festival By gathering people's dreams, the Akasha Terminal can combine the knowledge of all the people in Sumeru City, something Dehya likens to turning Sumeru City into a "single, massive brain."The Continuation of the Sabzeruz Festival Greater Lord Rukkhadevata created the Akasha System to "borrow" the dreams of her people and empower her, as she was unable to eradicate the second coming of the forbidden knowledge invading Irminsul with her strength alone. Recently, the Akademiya's sages maximized the Akasha's output by trapping the denizens of Sumeru City in a samsara, harvesting their dreams repeatedly as part of their plans to elevate Scaramouche to godhood.Secret of the Scorching Desert
The Akasha System is also capable of computation.Cry From the Eleazar Hospital With this function, the Akasha System can produce new data, such as predicting the movement of certain persons based on their existing data. The Akademiya used this to escape the claws of Cyno General Mahamatra Cyno during his investigation.
Lesser Lord Kusanali is referred to as "The First Akasha Terminal," and can enter anyone's mind as long as they're wearing their Akasha Terminal. However, she refuses to possess living beings unless absolutely necessary, instead opting to control Katheryne due to her being an artificial lifeform.Dawn (Quest)
A weaponized upgrade of the Akasha Terminal, the "Neo Akasha Terminal," was created by Kusanali. This floating device assisted the Traveler in their battle against Joururi Workshop Shouki no Kami.
After Kusanali was freed from the Sanctuary of Surasthana, she chose to halt the usage of the Akasha System, as it had fulfilled its purpose in restoring Irminsul and she deemed it not beneficial for her people's well-being, even though it was pointed out that some may resent her for it. The system is no longer operational, as she gave up her Gnosis to Il Dottore following an information exchange. This in turn has also allowed the people of Sumeru to dream once more.
Before the Akasha System was shut down, Moseis was able to create imaginary, hyper-realistic models of people within a dream, requiring only a miniscule portion of the Akasha's Jnana Energy supply to do so. By transferring his consciousness to the Akasha, Moseis was able to become the host of that dream while still being fully awake, ensuring that it would never collapse due to him waking up. Thanks to signaling devices which he implanted on specific individuals, Moseis was able to continue harvesting Jnana Energy from them to fuel his dream, even after the Akasha was turned off. Additionally, those with the signaling devices planted on their bodies were thus connected to a network that allowed them to enter the dream.Dream of Falling
Canned Knowledge
Canned Knowledge is information contained within a Knowledge Capsule. Unlike the information from the Akasha System, which restricts access to knowledge based on the user's demographics, anyone can learn the information in a Knowledge Capsule. To use it, one must link it to their personal Akasha Terminal.
While Canned Knowledge is safe to use if used sparingly, the risks are such that the Akademiya has banned the possession, sale, and usage of Canned Knowledge across Sumeru, with those found guilty of those things having their right to study at the Akademiya revoked.Puspa Café Message Board Matra's Message Despite its illegality, extensive smuggling operations have been formed to create Canned Knowledge and sell it on the black market. Canned Knowledge is used by those who are dissatisfied with the information provided to them by the Akasha, like the Eremites, commoners, and some Akademiya students.Lost in Prosperity
Some Knowledge Capsules are higher in quality than others; more valuable ones are richer in Dendro energy and thus tend to show up brighter when using Elemental Sight, though this is not always completely accurate. For example, once-useful knowledge may still shine brightly even when it has become less relevant in the modern day.
The Canned Knowledge contained within Knowledge Capsules can be relatively obscure, ranging from "An Analysis of the Sociological Ideology and Dialectics of the Hilichurls" to "An Introduction to Traditional Sumeru Brewing Techniques." Much Canned Knowledge has been leaked from the Akademiya itself.
Lesser Lord Kusanali was able to extract Moseis' consciousness from the Akasha into a Knowledge Capsule so that it could be imported back into his brain.Dream of Farewell
Divine Knowledge Capsule
A Divine Knowledge Capsule is a Knowledge Capsule that supposedly contains the wisdom of the gods. Divine Knowledge Capsules glow bright red. The knowledge from Divine Knowledge Capsules is extracted from scholars that have gone mad trying to link their minds to Irminsul; the tree contains remnants of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's consciousness,  which is the source of the divine knowledge, but is also contaminated by forbidden knowledge, which drives the scholars insane. Anyone who attempts to draw knowledge from Divine Knowledge Capsules goes mad, as seen when Mizri violently attacks the Traveler and Alhaitham before muttering Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's last words, "World... forget me."Ever So Close Sumeru Akademiya's sages seek to use the divine wisdom contained in the Divine Knowledge Capsules to turn Scaramouche into a god.
Jnagarbha Day
Jnagarbha Day is a special occasion when the Akademiya enters new information into the Akasha System. Beside data for the general granting knowledge function, data of specific people can also be entered to make use of the Akasha's computation function. The Akademiya is typically more crowded than usual during Jnagarbha Day.
After Lesser Lord Kusanali shut down the Akasha System, Jnagarbha Day was no longer needed.</text>

<title>Barnabas</title>
<text>BarnabasBecause the Sumeru Fatuus is never directly referred to by name in the Manga, the name "Barnabas" has been assumed for convenience of description, based on the voice in Collei's head during "Serpent's Dance" and his description in Dual Recurrence's official synopsis as a "mysterious foe from [Collei's] past." is a Manga-only character. A Fatuus from Sumeru, Barnabas pursues his former experimentation subject Collei to Mondstadt upon discovering that she may still be alive.
Profile
Barnabas appears to have been a respected seer in Sumeru, which led Collei's parents to bring her to him in hopes of saving her from her chronic illness. Unbeknownst to them, he was in league with the Fatui and, rather than taking her in to cure her of the "[touch of] the deev," he took her in so he could use her as a test subject for the effects of directly injecting a god's remains (originally translated as ' archon residue')The original Chinese name for "archon residue" is 魔神残渣 rm=demon god residue, referring to gods who predate the rise of the The Seven Seven Archons, and can be likened to Tatarigami and karma. into a human being.
In the present, Barnabas is a subordinate to the Fatui Harbinger Il Dottore. After Dottore expresses his disinterest in handling the Black Fire Incident, Barnabas takes responsibility for it and promises to bring back something interesting. However, due to Kaeya and Diluc's plan as well as unexpected resistance from Amber and Collei, Barnabas is instead left severely wounded and humiliated upon his return to the vexed Harbinger.
Appearance
Barnabas is a short old man with dark gray-brown skin, yellow eyes, white hair, and a white mustache and goatee. He wears a patterned purple and orange scarf around his neck and shoulders, a white vest with gold accents unbuttoned to expose his bare chest. An eye symbol is tattooed onto the side of his left shoulder. Most of his arms are wrapped in bandages.
In his beast form. Barnabas resembles a gigantic muscular lion with navy blue skin, black mane and glowing red eyes. He has fangs, a snake-like tongue and a pair of three pink horns.
Story
When Collei was a baby, her parents left her with Barnabas in hopes that he could cure her of her affliction. Instead, he used her for human experiments and ordered his men to "get rid" of Collei's mother when she attempted to visit her daughter. Collei was left deeply embittered by these painful experiments, the innate destructiveness she embodied after becoming a successful test subject, and the rejection she faced in Sumeru for being "unclean." In her quest for vengeance, she traveled from Sumeru to the City of Mondstadt in hopes that the Mondstadt Library would have information on him.
Collei arrived at Mondstadt right as a Fatui diplomatic convoy was about to depart on Dottore's whims. When the guards at the gate proved hesitant to let her in on account of her disease, Collei used her powers to target the convoy, killing the two diplomats inside the carriage. In the ensuing panic, Collei slipped into the city. The Knights of Favonius dubbed this event the "Black Fire Incident" and began investigating the matter, eventually finding a document which revealed that Collei's power was connected to an incident from three years prior involving Crepus Crepus Ragnvindr and a Delusion,Observing the way Jean holds the burnt document in Chapter 6 (Part 2), pages 2–3 reveals that it is a single, folded document which details both Crepus' Delusion and the syringe used to inject Collei with the god's remains, which is seen in a flashback in Chapter 10 (Part 1), page 18. although Barnabas' role in that incident is unclear. After learning the document might contain information on how to treat Collei's affliction by sealing the god's remains, Lisa sent word to Sumeru Akademiya to request Cyno's assistance.
Meanwhile, the Knights of Favonius' report about the Black Fire Incident reached Dottore and Barnabas. Intrigued by the description of the event, and given free reign over the situation by Dottore, Barnabas vowed to bring back "something worthy of [his] interest." He arrived during Ludi Harpastum and witnessed Kaeya's clash with Collei, as well as Amber's intervention. The next day, he brought up the incident, framing Amber as a traitor working with the murderer. Kaeya feigned cooperation but had already concocted a plan with Diluc to trick the Fatui: Diluc would distract Barnabas and his men by wielding Crepus' Delusion, which gave off a nearly identical effect as Collei's injected god's remains due to their shared origin, and posing as the perpetrator of the crime. While they were able to trick Barnabas' bodyguards, Barnabas sensed Collei's power as Cyno sealed it away and left on his own to hunt her down.
Intrigued that someone managed to survive being injected with the god's remains, he harangued Collei in a bid to convince her to reawaken the freshly sealed god's remains, which would take her over if activated again. Amber attacked him to avoid letting Collei lose control again, disarming him and pinning him down with her arrows before he unleashed a god's power through a seal on his neck, which transformed him into a giant beast.
Despite facing incredible odds against Barnabas' new form, Amber refused to give up. Collei's desire to gain the power to protect those she cares about caused a temporary change in Amber's Vision, and the two stood against Barnabas together. At a critical moment, Diluc used his Delusion to pin down Barnabas, giving Amber an opportunity to land a critical blow. His power spent, Barnabas returned to his human form and collapsed the ground. Upon seeing Diluc, Barnabas uttered his surprise at seeing the Delusion in the redhead's hands before falling unconscious. At that moment, Kaeya and Barnabas' guards arrived on the scene and arrested Diluc, thus "capturing" the culprit of the Black Fire Incident and drawing the situation to a close.
Barnabas is last seen before Dottore, who is less than pleased by the results he had obtained. Dottore tells his men to "dispose of this garbage," with the heavily wounded Barnabas unable to plead for mercy with his mouth bandaged up. Meanwhile, Diluc had escaped and destroyed the Delusion in the process, leaving Dottore's men with nothing to show for their last four years of work.

<title>Mikage Furnace</title>
<text>The largest smelting facility in all the islands of Inazuma, surrounded by jagged, rocky terrain. War has brought production to a halt. Version 1.5 Special Program
Mikage Furnace ja=御影炉心 ja_rm=Mikage Roshin is a location in Tatarasuna, Kannazuka, Inazuma. This plant is where Inazuma's famed Jade Steel was produced en masse until production was halted due to the war. By the time the Traveler reaches Inazuma, the area around the Furnace is blocked by a blue dome barrier until the rifts on the barrier are destroyed in the Tatara Tales (Quest) Tatara Tales quest. Additionally, the area inflicts Balethunder until completion of the World Quest Tatara Tales: The Last Act.
Containment Dome
Initially, the furnace is surrounded by a large containment dome, preventing the player from entering. The barrier extends far upward, preventing the player from even stepping on the cliffs above the furnace.
Breaking the barrier involves completing the first stage of the Tatara Tales (Quest) Tatara Tales quest chain and using three Kamuijima Cannons to break the tears in the dome. After this, the player will be able to enter the area.
Lore
The Mikage Furnace was initially established as a smelting plant for Jade Steel 400 years ago, a material unique to Inazuma-made swords. It used the power of Tatarigami energy sourced from Yashiori Island and was built with the help of some experts from Fontaine, one of which being an engineer named Xavier. He was the only one who stayed behind for the equipment maintenance meant to be overseen by Hanbei.Tatara Tales (Quest)
At some point before the war between the Shogunate and the Watatsumi Army, Alice visited Tatarasuna, accompanied by then leader of the workers, Kagami Gozen. She "took the liberty of modifying the Mikage Furnace", improving the containment dome and limiting the production output at the expense of better safety and potentially smaller explosion.Teyvat Travel Guide
However, during the war, high saturation of Tatarigami energy "caused deactivation of the Mikage Furnace and the failure of even its auto-restart program."Tatara Tales: Process Is Everything and production came to a halt. Xavier then set up the containment dome to surround the plant and contain the Balethunder.Tatara Tales: Priority Investigation
The instability of the plant caused a conflict of interest between Shogunate officials and Shrine maidens; Shogunate lackeys were more concerned of the effect of halted Jade Steel production in the war effort, while the maidens were worried of the Tatarigami's effects emanating from the damaged Furnace, being felt as far as the Sacred Sakura all the way in Grand Narukami Shrine.
When the Traveler talks to Xavier and undergoes the Tatara Tales quest chain, parts of the containment dome had been breached by the Fatui, who had started to take an interest in the power of the Tatarigami. In an effort to drive the Fatui away as well as break down the dome for both Xavier and the Traveler to better monitor the Furnace, three unused Kamuijima Cannons found along the eastern side of Tatarasuna are fired at the dome. Over the course of the quest chain, the Traveler helps Xavier monitor and eventually repair the Furnace while dealing with the Fatui, removing Balethunder from the area.</text>

<title>Field Tiller</title>
<text>the specific object in the world named "Field Tiller" the type of enemy also known as "Field Tiller" Ruin Guard
The Field Tiller, referred to as Weird Statue before completing 'We Will Be Reunited', is an inactive Ruin Guard located in Mondstadt, on the upper deck of the central tower of Stormterror's Lair. It was the first Ruin Guard ever created, being a prototype that was far stronger than the Ruin Guards created after.
Lore
"The land is not to be tilled with farming tools, but rather to be fought for with steel and blood." -This is how the "Field Tiller" came about.
"Field Tiller" was a codename given by the people of Khaenri'ah to the war machines now known as Ruin Guards.
The first Field Tiller was a prototype that was far stronger than a normal Ruin Guard, despite sharing a similar appearance to them. At some point,It is unclear whether the first Field Tiller came to Mondstadt before or after the cataclysm. Barbara's story only vaguely frames the story between Decarabian's death and before the present day, and Andrius' account of his fight against the Field Tiller places it after he moved to Wolvendom - except there is no timeframe for that either. Note that Guizhong, who lived far before Decarabian fell, had access to Ruin Guards and Ruin Hunters; in addition, Ruin Guards accompanied the Khaenri'ah delegation to Enkanomiya. Since Ruin Guards have existed for such a long time, it is possible that the first Field Tiller wandered into Mondstadt before the cataclysm and not after it, like most other Ruin Guards. this Field Tiller left Khaenri'ah and mindlessly roamed around Teyvat like most Ruin Guards did after the cataclysm, eventually arriving at Wolvendom. Andrius encountered the Field Tiller; mistaking it as a challenger, he fought the Field Tiller in battle, and after Andrius had dealt enough damage to it, it subsequently fled to the ruins of Old Mondstadt.
Severely damaged, it eventually became immobile but still active. Believing to have sensed danger, it launched missiles at anyone that it detected was attempting to enter Old Mondstadt to drive them off. The people of Mondstadt, who had little knowledge of the Ruin Machines, believed it to be a final act of fury from the deceased Anemo Archon Decarabian and called the phenomenon the "Tyrant's Final Fury." This lasted for around a year before the Field Tiller shut down.Dishonorable Trial
All of the Ruin Guards today are just replicas of this machine. As the prototype, its combat capability was unrestricted.
The Abyss Order had a plan to place the eye of the first Field Tiller into the Defiled Statue and attach Osial's limbs to it to create a mechanized god. When the Traveler tries to use Elemental Sight to extract the eye of the first Field Tiller, it does not work. Dainsleif explains that is because the Field Tiller is not powered by elemental energy. Dainsleif then uses his own power to extract the eye and vows to protect it himself to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands.A Soul Set Apart

<text>The Elemental Burst - or Burst for short - is a Talent that requires Energy to use and is usually more powerful than the Elemental Skill. In community circles, it is sometimes referred to as an "Ultimate" ("Ult" for short) or Q (reference to the corresponding default hotkey on PC).
Elemental Bursts grant a varying number of Invincibility Frames upon casting, during its duration where the character is immune to damage. For the duration of these i-frames, the HP bar locks, effectively preventing any forms of damage from enemies or debuffs for at least a few seconds, depending on the character.
Overview
Every character has the talent associated with the Elemental Burst unlocked by default. In order for it to be used, it is required to fulfill two conditions:
# Just like with the Elemental Skill, the Burst must not be on cooldown. When it is on cooldown, the Elemental Burst icon on the HUD located at the bottom-right side of the screen will show how much time it takes for it to be ready again, similar to Elemental Skills.
# The character must have gathered as much energy as the Burst's Energy Cost indicates. The Energy collected since the last time the Burst was used by the on-field character is reflected in the Elemental Burst icon as it fills with the character's element's color. Excess Energy is not taken into account.
Whenever both conditions are fulfilled, the Elemental Burst icon will glow and an audio cue will play, indicating that it is ready to be used. When a character off field has their Burst ready, the icon will appear next to their portrait and life bar. On certain mobile versions, this icon is replaced by a checkmark of the same color. The same checkmark will appear below other players' names in co-op and in the sidebar. After using an Elemental Burst, all Energy will be consumed and the skill will enter a short cooldown (Energy can still be gathered while in cooldown).

<title>Ako Domeki</title>
<text>Captain Ako Domeki Zaemon ja=赤穗百目鬼左衛門 ja_rm=Akou Doumeki Zaemon was a famous bandit and pirate from Seirai IslandHamayumi who lived around 500 years ago,Interactable: Pirate's Diary best known for leading a rebellion against the Inazuma Shogunate.
He commandeered a fleet of over ten ships and helmed his flagship, "Seiraimaru" . He was also the original wielder of "The Catch" and possessed Ako's Sake Vessel."The Catch"
Story
Early life
Following the cataclysm 500 years ago, Asase Hibiki retired from the Grand Narukami Shrine and returned to her hometown shrine, Asase Shrine. Domeki frequented the shrine and became familiar with her, and despite calling her a "naggy, fretful aunt," still listened to her stories and helped take care of the shrine. Neko thought of him as a "very tall and loud human"Neko Is a Cat: Shrine Cleanup as well as an "undignified glutton."Neko Is a Cat: Shrine Recipe
Rebellion
Some years later, after the city at Ritou was built,Ornate Kabuto Domeki led a rebellion against the Shogunate. During one battle, he managed to defeat and steal a Maguu Kenki puppet,Event Echoing Tales Conch Retrospection, II: Echoing Tales Story II: Strangers in a Strange Boat Strangers in a Strange Boat a machine built based on Iwakura Michihiro and his techniques. Ako Domeki grew in notoriety throughout Narukami Island, although Hiiragi Hiroshi believed he would still be no match for the actual Doukei, who was at the time the Kujou Clan's sword instructor.
Although Domeki tried to deter Hibiki from becoming involved with his rebellion, she ultimately attempted to aid his cause by unsealing the Thunder Manifestation to destroy the Shogunate's ships. While it was successful on that front, it also created a massive Electro storm in the middle of the island that destroyed most of the area in the process. Both Hibiki and Domeki headed into the storm, leaving Neko behind at Asase Shrine.Seirai Stormchasers: Part I
In the ensuing devastation, Ako and his crew were swept away. His chief mate, Janome, and some of their other men, including Kosekimaru the ship holding the Maguu Kenki, protected Domeki but became stranded on the Golden Apple Archipelago as a result. Eventually, they managed to escape the Archipelago alongside the archipelago's other inhabitants,From Outer Lands and return to Seirai Island.Treasure Voyage
Ako Domeki himself managed to return to Seirai Island, only to find it now in ruins. There he made his final vow - to fulfill Hibiki's wish to see the world in her place - and sailed away once more.
Legacy
During the events of Summertime Odyssey, Ako's previously wrecked ship, Kosekimaru, temporarily gained sentience and was named as Miitoboru.
Notes
* Ako Domeki addresses Asase as an "aunt," but it is left ambiguous whether the two are actually blood-related or if he is using an affectionate term out of courtesy for an older woman.</text>

<title>Josephine</title>
<text>Josephine was the alias of a young woman from Fleuve Cendre who lived over 500 years ago. She was Parsifal the Great's younger sister and served as Parsifal's magician's assistant.
Profile
Parsifal and Josephine were sisters born in the impoverished slums of Fleuve Cendre, located underneath the Court of Fontaine. They turned to thievery for survival, using magic performances as a veil for their acts and adopting stage names derived from one of Coppelius' plays - which itself was based on the story of Mondstadt Aristocracy figures Parsifal and the Blue-Eyed Spear Witch. During their trips aboveground, the two grew enamored with the idea of performing at the opera house and pursued legitimate performances over thievery. They started with performances at Eduardo Baker's tavern before making a name for themselves in the Court of Fontaine.The First Great Magic
When the purge of Fleuve CendreFleuve Cendre Ferryman occurred, Josephine rushed back to her home, only to find the death and destruction that had been left in its wake. Josephine's fate afterwards is unclear, although it is said that the destruction of Fleuve Cendre caused her to lose her "place" in life and led her to design a "'grand magic trick' that belonged to them."
The First Great Magic suggests that the younger sister adopted the "Parsifal" persona following the purge,The second-to-last paragraph of The First Great Magic's description starts by implying that Parsifal's assistant was unnotable, before segueing into descriptions of two popular magic tricks: where the assistant is cut in half but emerges in one piece, and where a missing item is returned to the crowd unnoticed. These two tricks are used as parallels for how the girl, referring to Josephine from the previous paragraph, lost her "accustomed place" in life. (The phrase "accustomed" is present in the original Chinese description, but was left out of the English version.) and "Josephine" has not been mentioned in later events involving Parsifal. If this is the case, then "Parsifal"'s involvements at Poisson before the Siege of Poisson, as well as her "unexpected transgression" and death by trial by combat against Marfisa,Moment of Judgment were actually performed by the younger sister who originally played "Josephine."

<title>Invincibility Frame</title>
<text>Invincibility frames, often shortened to i-frames, refers to frames where characters or enemies cannot receive certain damage, either by temporarily disabling their hitbox, or by being granted temporary full invulnerability.
Types
Hitbox Removal
Hitbox-removing i-frames work by temporarily disabling your character's hitbox (invisible model used for collision detection) to most attacks, making them unable to hit the character. Some attacks however cannot be avoided using hitbox-removing i-frames, such as Beneath the Dragon-Queller Azhdaha's Body Slam attack.
Hitbox-removing i-frames are granted to players after Sprinting Dash Dashing (including using an Alternate Sprint). Dash i-frames start 40ms after pressing the dash button and last for 300ms.
Although some Normal Attacks and Elemental Skills can make the character briefly disappear, they do not grant i-frames.
Damage Nullification
Damage-nullifying i-frames temporarily grant your character full invulnerability, nullifying all incoming damage, including those that cannot be avoided using hitbox-removing i-frames, and those from status effects such as Sheer Cold and Corrosion. However, due to your character's hitbox still being present, most status effects such as Corrosion, Beneath the Dragon-Queller Ley Line Disorder Azhdaha's Ley Line Disorder, Enter the Golden House Childe's Riptide, and most elemental statuses will apply as normal on hit. The only exceptions are the Cryo and Hydro statuses, which cannot apply during damage-nullifying i-frames.
Damage-nullifying i-frames can be granted to players by casting any Elemental Burst, casting the hold version of Mona's Mirror Reflection of Doom, or tapping Parry near the precise moment of an incoming hit. Damage-nullifying i-frames are also granted for about three seconds after a forced switch due to a character death. The duration of the i-frames vary between talents.
Previews
Hitbox Removal
Damage Nullification
Enemies
Certain enemies can also grant themselves invincibility frames, while performing certain attacks or transitioning to a new phase.
When enemies are in an invincible state, characters can still generate Energy particles by casting their Elemental Skills, or trigger certain passive effects that require hits to land, such as that of The Black Sword. However, you will not be able to score Critical Hits, therefore passives such as that of the Favonius Series weapons cannot trigger. Exceptions to this rule include all Ruin Machines while activating from their idle state, during which hits on them will not register at all.
Enemies that utilize i-frames include:</text>

The Fountain of Lucine is where all the water flowing through Fontaine converges; even tears would flow back to the Fountain.The City of Rains and Remembrance It is customary for newlyweds to wish for children at the Fountain of Lucine, and the tradition of throwing coins into fountains originates from throwing Hydro Sigils into the Fountain of Lucine.Fontaine Elemental Sigils quote = Few people know that the true origin of throwing coins into the fountain comes from tossing Hydro Sigils into the Fountain of Lucine, which is in fact the correct way of making a wish to the fountain. Originally, wishing at the Fountain of Lucine was a ritual for Oceanids who longed for human life to be blessed by the spring water and become humans in the later months.Finale
Not just water, however, flows into the Fountain; in the case of Vigneire and the victims of the missing disappearances case who all dissolved from contact with Water from the Primordial Sea, their consciousnesses also converged into the Fountain of Lucine, forming an Oceanid. The voice of the Oceanid formed from their collective consciousnesses can be heard by people sensitive to the Hydro element, and heightening that sensitivity will allow a person to meet the Oceanid within the Fountain. The Traveler and Vacher accomplished this by drinking Water from the Primordial Sea. The Oceanid in the Fountain has some degree of psychic prowess, as they attempted to "drown" Vacher during their confrontation with him, which caused him to lose his mind and die from a panic attack shortly after.When All Return to the Waters</text>

<title>Seymour</title>
<text>Seymour, real name Prototype 4ACV07, is an NPC that first appeared in the Ancient Colors.
After completing The Final Question, he can be found in The Narzissenkreuz Ordo.
Profile
Seymour was originally created by Alain Guillotin to assist his sister Mary-Ann Guillotin with her work as a member of the Marechaussee Phantom.Masterpiece's Overture When Mary-Ann was assigned to capture members of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo in Elynas, Seymour accompanied her. A fierce battle broke out between the members of the Phantom and the Ordo, during which Seymour was severely damaged and incapacitated.The Final Question
For (1/7)\times 10^{21} clockwork cycles (around 493 years), Seymour's functions were in hibernation. During this time, he was discovered by Mamere. Mamere would talk about her art with Seymour, unaware that Seymour was inactive and using pre-recorded voice assets to speak to her.The Illusion's Finishings However, after she and the Traveler rebooted Seymour using Mamere's "token" (that Melusines are born with), Seymour restarted his natural language processing unit.There Will Come Soft Rains
During the events of other World Quest series, Seymour would meet the Oceanid Ann at The Narzissenkreuz Ordo, where they would try to find Mary-Ann. Eventually, the Traveler would discover a member of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, Caterpillar, in the Fortress of Meropide, who had been imprisoned there after completing a deed for the "Master". When they escaped the prison and returned to the Ordo, Seymour and Ann had just returned from a trip when he sensed Narzissenkreuz Ordo remnants (Caterpillar) and activated his "Annihilation" mode. Caterpillar gave the phrase "This is my little invention.", which Seymour recognized and downgraded his threat mode, asking Caterpillar to surrender. Caterpillar told him that he had already surrendered to the Traveler, and the group began sharing what information they had found in their travels.
Seymour is able to recognize 103,900 different styles of art, but not Mamere's. He is also able to dive underwater like the Melusines and blast through rocks with his mining module.
Eventually, with the assistance of Ann, Caterpillar and the Traveler, Seymour eventually reunites with his master, "Mary-Ann". Ann and Mary-Ann decides to go on a trip to see the outside world, which Seymour agrees to. He also suggests bringing Mamere along, as she had taken care of him, which they also agree to. Once Mamere was brought along, they embark on their trip.

<title>Golden Apple Archipelago/1.6</title>
<text>Initially only a handful of small islands, the Golden Apple Archipelago turns out to be a cluster of multiple mountainous islands after completing Summer Vacation: Proceed With Caution.
If the player did not participate in the Midsummer Island Adventure event, they can finish the Summer Gift quest to receive the Wind-Blessed Harpastum to complete the various puzzles.
The requirements to unlock the Golden Archipelago are:
* Complete True Treasure.
* Complete Song of the Dragon and Freedom.
* Start the Mysterious Islands: Journey to the Unknown.
Subareas
Once unlocked, the archipelago can be accessed in the Map via the Map Tabs, alongside the Teyvat map and Serenitea Pot map. Upon zooming out, the names of the four subareas will appear:
* Pudding Isle 1.6 Pudding Isle
* Twinning Isle 1.6 Twinning Isle
* Broken Isle 1.6 Broken Isle
* Minacious Isle 1.6 Minacious Isle
In Part I, each Isle has 1 Teleport Waypoint and 1 Waverider Waypoint. The player starts on Pudding Isle. One can follow the Glimmering Beacons to unlock the Teleport Waypoints in a "counterclockwise" fashion, heading north to Twinning Isle, then west to Broken Isle, then south to Minacious Isle. However, it's easier to click "Navigate" on the locked teleport waypoints and go directly towards them from there, in whichever order you wish.
Initially, the entire archipelago is filled with dense fog. However, after unlocking the four Teleport Waypoints, the fog lifts, turning bright during the day. The sun glows gold like an apple in the sky, revealing the tropical backdrop of the archipelago. The background music will also change into a relaxing tropical theme.
In Part II, some more islands (like the Central Platform) emerged along with new Waypoints. Sea Ganoderma appeared as well. Fog and fog-like conditions appear in certain parts of the archipelago, mostly tied to World Quests.
After completing Dodo-King of the Sea: Lying in Wait, the player can challenge the Maguu Kenki at the Central Platform, similarly to the other Bosses Normal Bosses.</text>

<title>Musou no Hitotachi</title>
<text>the sword technique Raiden Shogun's Elemental Burst Secret Art: Musou Shinsetsu
The Musou no Hitotachi (Japanese: 無想の一太刀, also written as 夢想の一太刀 following the events of Chapter II)Secret Art: Musou Shinsetsu is an extremely powerful and legendary sword technique performed by the Electro Archon, the Raiden Shogun, specifically Ei and the Shogun.
Overview
The profoundest of the profound is the Musou no Hitotachi. A sword art without parallel in all the world.
When Ei uses the Musou no Hitotachi, she dashes behind her target and slices through a point in space with the Musou Isshin, briefly freezing time. The target will be marked with the Electro symbol before being surrounded by six lightning bolts before time is unfrozen. Those lightning bolts then all simultaneously slash the target before engulfing them in a beam of lightning, killing them instantly.
When Ei used Musou no Hitotachi on Orobashi and Akuou during the Watatsumi Island insurrection, the resulting slash split Yashiori Island in half and created Musoujin Gorge. The Shogun also used this technique to punish those who lose a duel before the throne, with two known victims being Kazuha's friend and Signora.Duel Before the Throne
The people of Inazuma revere the Musou no Hitotachi almost as much as the Raiden Shogun herself, as they believe no one can defend against it. As a result, it has become a symbol of the Raiden Shogun's power to protect Inazuma from all threats; Kujou Takayuki's hubris in his dealings with the Fatui stemmed from his overconfidence in the Musou no Hitotachi's power. The Traveler managed to escape death from Musou no Hitotachi twice: the first attempt was interrupted by Thoma, who distracted the Shogun by throwing a spear at her,Amidst Stormy Judgment while Kaedehara Kazuha managed to block the Shogun's second attempt with the power of both his own Anemo Vision and his deceased friend's reawakened Electro Vision.The Omnipresent God

<title>Dwight Lasker</title>
<text>Dwight LaskerDwight's full name can be deduced between Forgotten Vessel and Veteran's Visage's descriptions. was the director of the Institute of Natural Philosophy around 400–500 years ago.Interactable: Institute of Natural Philosophy Ancient Notes Ancient Notes He was also a member of the Narzissenkreuz Institute before the cataclysm, and a childhood friend of Basil Elton, Emanuel Guillotin and Karl Ingold.Forgotten VesselVeteran's Visage
Profile
Dwight was born before the cataclysm 500 years ago and was sent to the Narzissenkreuz Institute during his childhood, where he became friends with Basil, Emanuel, and Karl.
At some point, Dwight became the director of the Institute of Natural Philosophy, a position he held until middle age.The director's age is presumed to be similar to that of Basil and the other friends. This inference is based on details found in stories such as the Heroes' Tea Party and Basil's quotes, which indicate that they are no longer young. He recruited numerous child prodigies as researchers at the Institute. It is known that Coppelius worked at his Institute when he was a child. Dwight mentioned "Ever since he was a child, he's always been incredibly talented."
During the cataclysm, Dwight closed the Institute for the safety of its members. He wanted to prevent the young ones to go out and engage in battle. Dwight believed that it was crucial to prioritize post-disaster reconstruction rather than sending people to die.
After the cataclysm, Fontaine experienced "the first flood period,"Rene's Investigation Notes during which most of the buildings would gradually be submerged. Dwight had selected a good piece of land near the Fountain of Lucine as the new location for the Institute of Natural Philosophy. However, he was informed that the area would be replaced by the Opera Epiclese. Dwight felt dissatisfied with this decision and criticizing "They'd sooner set faces aflame with shame and laughter! To think that anyone could be so comical..."
Later on, Dwight and others paid their respects at Basil's grave. Emanuel Guillotin introduced his adopted son, Alain Guillotin, to Dwight, seeking Institute support for Alain. Dwight later met with the newly appointed Iudex (likely Neuvillette) and believed that he was "much more reliable than Leon and those other clowns."
Alain's research and breakthroughs in clockwork meka caught Dwight's attention. Later, Alain achieved satisfactory results in the early phases of his research on Ruin Machine Khaenri'ah war machines and Primal Constructs energy. Impressed by Alain's progress, Dwight increased the Institute's investment in his work. Additionally, Dwight took notice of Alain's research assistant, Carter Scherbius, frequently taking leaves of absence.
Afterwards, Alain introduced Rene de Petrichor and Jakob Ingold to Dwight. After some consideration, Dwight accepted them and arranged for them to work in Alain's lab. However, this decision caused discontent among other researchers.Interactable: Ancient Log Ancient Log  3 Ancient Log  3
Dwight visited Carter while he was unconscious and collected his blood samples in an attempt to find a cure or a way to mitigate his illness. Meanwhile, Rene learned about Carter's condition. He decided to separate himself and Jakob from Alain's project.Enigmatic Page (IV) Rene approached Dwight with a request for an independent research project related to the Abyss, which included studying Durin's Scarlet Quartz blood, Elynas (NPC) Elynas' remains, and the Dark Mud from Liyue.Enigmatic Page (V) Dwight believed that the proposed research plan held significant practical value in addressing the toxins contaminating Fontaine's soil and water due to Elynas. Consequently, he decided to approve it. At the same time, Dwight discovered that Rene and Jakob were the adopted sons of his childhood friend, Karl Ingold.
Soon after, Alain achieved a remarkable feat by successfully inventing Arkhe energy systems, also known as "Pneumousia Energy."YouTube:  Dwight recognized this accomplishment as the biggest breakthrough in a century and believed that it had the potential to revolutionize society in its entirety.
Dwight received a report regarding the Narzissenkreuz Ordo and their leader, referred to as the "Master."Interactable: Institute of Natural Philosophy Ancient Investigative Report Ancient Investigative Report He entrusted the investigation of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo to Emanuel Guillotin, a former Marechaussee Hunter and his childhood friend.
The whereabouts of Dwight are currently unknown. In present day, the Traveler found the Key to Some Place in the Institute key to Dwight's office inside a chest within The Narzissenkreuz Ordo and discovered several rifthounds in his office.

<title>Yanbo</title>
<text>Yanbo is a Millelith Squad Leader who disguised himself as a Treasure Hoarder to secretly investigate at Tiangong Gorge. After completing the Undetected Infiltration World Quest, he remains at Lumberpick Valley.
Profile
Yanbo is first encountered in disguise as a Treasure Hoarders Treasure Hoarder in The Chasm (Area) The Chasm, alongside other Millelith members that the Traveler must defeat in order to begin his World Quest.
Yanbo reveals that he and his squad members have been sent to infiltrate the Treasure Hoarders occupying the Chasm, as well as securing the area and defending one of the Bedrock Keys in the vicinity. He claims that the Traveler has broken the law and must serve a lengthy prison sentence unless they agree to help him clear out the Treasure Hoarder camps in Lumberpick Valley.
As Yanbo is now undermanned due to the Traveler putting part of his squad out of commission, he requests them to clear out two out of the three supply camps in the area, while he and his men neutralize the third. Once that is done, the Treasure Hoarders at their main camp will be severely weakened, depending on what minor camps were defeated.
At the main camp, Yanbo and the Traveler discover that the Treasure Hoarders are under the command of Brass Bull Zhao and Chen the Flower, who are apparently setting up a deal with the Fatui. It is revealed that the Fatui are apparently buying rations and foodstuffs off the Treasure Hoarders; enraged at the interruption, Zhao sends multiple waves of her men against the Traveler.
With the Treasure Hoarders and Fatui defeated by the Traveler, Yanbo would end up foiling the agreement supplying rations down to the Fatui expedition in the mines, unknowingly dooming his Anton former friends to starvation.
Appearance
Yanbo initially appears wearing Treasure Hoarder attire, before switching into Millelith clothes by the end of the quest.

<title>Decarabian's Mondstadt</title>
<text>Information about rebellion and aftermath
Decarabian's Mondstadt, commonly referred to as Old Mondstadt, was the original location of the nation of Mondstadt. It was created by the God of Storms, Decarabian, who built his capital city within a deep valley and created a large tower from which he ruled. His reign ended 2,600 years ago, when his people rebelled against him and ultimately slew him.Amos' Bow Afterwards, the newly crowned Anemo Archon, Barbatos, moved the people of Mondstadt to Cider Lake, where the current-day City of Mondstadt was built.
During the cataclysm five hundred years ago, Dvalin took up residence in Decarabian's tower to recover from the injuries incurred during his battle against Durin. In subsequent years, after the people of Mondstadt forgot about Dvalin, the area of Old Mondstadt became known as Stormterror's Lair.
History
Little is known about the initial creation of Mondstadt, but Decarabian's City is described as a "dream of prosperity" which was "created entirely by his divine might."Tile of Decarabian's Tower His territory spread to the Brightcrown Mountains and Windwail Highland areas to the east and south, as evidenced by the ornamentation on some of the ruins in the area. Besides Decarabian's City, notable cloisters of ruins in its ornamentation style include the ruins in Brightcrown Canyon leading into the city, and the ruins around Cecilia Garden.
When the region of Mondstadt was blanketed in snow and ice as a result of Andrius' powers,Spirit Locket of Boreas Decarabian created an impenetrable storm wall around his capital city to protect those dwelling within from the bitter cold.
Culture
Architecture and Design
The architectural style of the ruins in Decarabian's Mondstadt is quite distinct from those found in the rest of modern-day Mondstadt, making it easy to identify ruins outside of the Stormterror's Lair area that are related to it.
Tall bridges are a distinctive feature within Decarabian's City and in the surrounding area.
Notably, the ruins associated with Decarabian's style lack Symbols in Teyvat symbols otherwise commonly seen in Teyvat, such as the triquetra. Instead, a symbol seen on ruins of Decarabian's Mondstadt is a cercelée, a type of cross with curled-in ends. The ornamental designs seen on bridges, pillars, and walls are margents, or plant-like motifs, rather than the Celtic knots commonly seen on ruins throughout Teyvat. (In a similar vein, the Wolf of the North arena in Wolvendom is decorated with Arabesques, another type of plant-like design, rather than Celtic knots.)
The structural integrity of Decarabian's ruins are apparently quite sturdy despite their age, remaining in rather good condition in the 2,600 years since its fall. Alice destroyed several arcades inside the tower to make it easier to climb, and the tower has remained stable despite that.Teyvat Travel Guide
Organization
Decarabian micromanaged his city, to the point of arranging who lived where. Even in the present, the residential area of the city is clearly delineated, suggesting that the city's layout was also something Decarabian determined.
Music
Under Decarabian's rule, certain tunes and chords were banned due to their association with dissent and rebellion.Song of Broken Pines
Geography
Based on the similarity between ruin structures as well as in-game documentation, the original scope of Old Mondstadt's territory encompassed the Brightcrown Mountains and Windwail Highland areas, and went as far south as the Teleport Waypoint between Liyue and Dawn Winery. It is currently unknown how far north or west it covered.
The most well-known settlement of Decarabian's Mondstadt was his capital city, located in the area now known as Stormterror's Lair.Debris of Decarabian's City It is located within an extremely deep, possibly manmade valley; it is currently one of the deepest locations on the explorable part of the Teyvat map.</text>

<title>Pulcinella</title>
<text>Pulcinella, also known by his codename "The Rooster," is the Fifth of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers and the Mayor of a city in Snezhnaya.YouTube:
He makes his first clear appearance during 'A Winter Night's Lazzo Teyvat Chapter Interlude Teaser: A Winter Night's Lazzo' alongside his fellow Harbingers.
He also appears as a silhouette during 'Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail' alongside his followers, and they are collectively known as "Pulcinella and followers" as the featured character(s) for Act VI, Snezhnaya.
Profile
Little is currently known about Pulcinella beyond his rank and title. Unlike several other Harbingers who were hand-picked for the position by Pierro, Tartaglia was instead inducted into the Fatui by Pulcinella and worked his way up into the Harbingers.
Appearance
Pulcinella is a white-haired elderly man with white mustache and rounded glasses along with pointy nose and ears. He wears a dark blue longcoat with flared and feathered sleeves over at least a pair of baggy blue trousers and long flared shoes. His coat has a wide feathered collar with some form of hat or headdress with a pair of feathers. He is surrounded by ice, but it is unknown if this implies the possession of a Cryo Vision or Delusion, or serves as just a visual shorthand for Snezhnaya.
Story
When Tartaglia (then known as Ajax) was 14 years old, he was drawn into the Abyss and re-emerged greatly changed by the events that transpired there, gaining unmatched combat prowess and an uncanny habit of having chaos follow in his wake. Following several incidents in Tartaglia's hometown village of Morepesok, his worried father brought him to the Fatui in hopes that they could hone his temperament, only to watch as his son easily beat up well-trained soldiers. Tartaglia's unique attributes piqued Pulcinella's curiosity, and he conscripted the boy into the Fatui under the guise of serving the Tsaritsa as punishment.
Present Day
An indeterminate amount of time ago, Signora made an agreement with the Liyue Qixing and dispatched the Ninth Company, which includes some of Pulcinella's men, on an expedition to The Chasm: Underground Mines The Chasm to explore its depths. Due to the amount of distance between The Chasm and the surface, their supply line with the Fatui stationed in Liyue Harbor was the Ninth Company's only way of getting both supplies and information about the surface.A Company Vanishing Into the DeepLost in a Foreign Land
However, following Tartaglia's actions in Liyue and the revival of Osial, relations between the Liyue Qixing and the Fatui soured greatly. The Qixing pulled their support from the expedition and forbade the Millelith from even making contact with the Fatui. With the supply line cut off, the Ninth Company was stranded without even the knowledge of what had occurred. By the time the Traveler finds them, the Ninth Company's original sixty-four members had been reduced to half its number, was divided into multiple groups, and no longer had a chain of command. Anton, a direct subordinate of Pulcinella's, bemoans that "dispens[ing] with less valuable assets" to achieve a greater goal is the Harbinger's modus operandi.
In 'A Winter Night's Lazzo', Pulcinella attends La Signora's funeral and orders all work to be halted for half a day to mourn her passing. The brevity of this mourning period draws criticism from Pantalone and Arlecchino.
Following Signora's death, Viktor fell under Pulcinella's command. Pulcinella immediately reassigned Viktor to Sumeru City to assist Vsevolod in coordinating the logistics regarding the newly opening Northland Bank branch.Equivalent Exchange Once More

<title>Abattouy</title>
<text>Abattouy was a SpantamadWanderings of a Lonesome Shadow researcher from Sumeru Akademiya and was Tighnari's junior. His background is explored in The Unanswerable Problems.
He is responsible for creating Karkata and the eight Energy Extraction Devices mentioned in the The Foolish Fatuus.
Profile
Abattouy enrolled in Sumeru Akademiya in order to study mechanical lifeforms, seeing them as machines with potential. However, the Akademiya prohibited the study of machines due to people going beyond acceptable norms in their experiments. He was unfazed and continued researching machinery, after being expelled from the Akademiya.
Regardless, Abattouy was determined to continue on with his research, although he lost contact with everyone he had met in the Akademiya, including Tighnari. He created a machine known as "Karkata," which looked much like a Ruin Defender. Abattouy was determined to bring Karkata to life, as the machine had the mindset of a child and could only understand simple responses. Roughly two years before the start of the game's events, he found a secluded area and began construction of a laboratory to continue his research and experiments.
Abattouy eventually made modifications to Karkata, giving it basic survival instincts so it could maintain itself when it was damaged or low on energy.
In order to make the most of his limited Mora, Abattouy began taking power from the Ley Lines by creating three generators and selling the failures to an Eremite named Kasim for some Mora.The Foolish Fatuus He also cut medication for his heart from his expenses, and he likely ate much less than usual. As a result, a malnourished Abattouy died when his heart acted up as his body became overwhelmed by the energy from Ley Line energy extractor and Karkata failed to understand Abattouy's request to shut it off. After Abattouy's death, Karkata, not understanding the concept of death, tried to collect parts to "repair" Abattouy to no avail.
Abattouy's body and laboratory would eventually be found by the Traveler and Tighnari, who had been investigating rumors of a supposedly contaminated zone different to that of The Withering, which had attracted droves of Ruin Machines to the area. Learning what happened to him through tape recordings, they shut the devices down before Tighnari buried him and destroyed his laboratory and most of his research to prevent the Akademiya from getting their hands on them.</text>

<title>Electro-Charged</title>
<text>Elemental Reactions in Genius Invokation TCG Genius Invokation TCG/Rules Elemental Reactions
Elemental Gauge Theory
Electro-Charged cannot damage off-field characters. Switching to a different character after being affected by Electro-Charged will temporarily pause its DoT ticks. However, if the Electro-Charged character becomes the active character again while still affected by Electro and Hydro, the DoT ticks will resume.
Overview
Electro-Charged targets will have both a Hydro and an Electro aura simultaneously. Electro-Charged DMG ticks once per second. Every tick reduces the Hydro and Electro auras of affected targets by 0.4 gauge units, and the ticks will stop once one of the auras is depleted. Note that the normal decay of elemental aura will still apply during Electro-Charged.
The coexistence of elements allows for effects like Thundersoother to be applied without forgoing Elemental Reactions entirely, and makes it possible for multiple reactions to be triggered on an Electro-Charged target if a third element is applied (e.g., Overloaded + Vaporize, Superconduct + Frozen, Electro + Hydro Swirl). However, when triggering reactions on an Electro-Charged target, the Electro reaction is prioritized, and the Hydro reaction will only be triggered if there are still gauge units of the triggering element left over after depleting the Electro aura.
Damage
Damage Transformative Reaction Damage Elemental Reaction/Level Scaling
Electro-Charged Damage is only affected by the level and Elemental Mastery of the character causing the reaction, and the target's Electro RES. It ignores the target's DEF and the attacker's ATK, and it cannot deal Critical Hits.

The Elemental Mastery bonus and any the target's Resistance multiplier are applied multiplicatively with the Base Damage.
Number of Hits
Electro-Charged deals damage immediately and continues to tick once every second for as long as it lasts. If Electro-Charged ends from either the Hydro or Electro aura expiring, another tick of damage will be dealt if over 0.5 seconds have passed since the last tick. Ticks of Electro-Charged will reduce the timers on both the Hydro and Electro auras unless the reduction would remove said aura.KeqingMains Theorycrafting Library:
Electro-Charged will also deal damage to nearby targets with the Hydro status, but will not apply an Electro aura.Reddit:
Environment
If an Electro attack hits a body of water, the water will become Electro-Charged for a short amount of time and any target that walks into it will take Electro DMG. Electro-Charged Water can cause Overloaded and Superconduct when attacked with Pyro and Cryo respectively.

This would likely mean that Pierro's Director position is unranked and that the Tenth of the Fatui Harbingers has not yet been introduced. However, Pierro's numerical rank, if he has one, will be left unknown until it is officially confirmed.
He makes his first appearance during '' alongside his fellow Harbingers.
Profile
Each one of us has borne witness to the absurd callousness of the foundational principles of this world.
So, let us don our masks in mockery of the world as we go forth and rewrite the rules of destiny.|Pierro
Pierro is the Director of the Fatui and the very first member of the organization. He has personally recruited several Harbingers, including Il Dottore, Scaramouche, and Signora.
Story
History
Before the cataclysm, Pierro was a royal mage of Khaenri'ah and lived with the Traveler's Sibling for a time. He failed to gain favor with Khaenri'ah's ruler, likely Irmin King Irmin, due to being less capable than the country's sages and could not stop them from doing something that tore away the "veil of sin." This brought "divine wrath and destruction" to the nation,Mocking Mask and Pierro was presumably among the pure-blooded Khaenri'ahns cursed with immortality.Fortune-Mocking Pedigree Eide: When the cataclysm came, we pure-blood Khaenri'ahns were declared the "greater sinners." Upon us, the gods placed the curse of immortality... For this reason, he became embittered with the "foundational principles of this world" and joined the Tsaritsa's cause, establishing the Fatui.
Recruiting Other Harbingers
At some point in the past, Pierro went to the Great Red Sand in pursuit of rumors surrounding an expelled Sumeru Akademiya scholar there performing heretical acts. He found Zandik, who readily agreed to join the Fatui Harbingers upon discovering that they were supportive of his efforts to create an enhanced human who could surpass the gods. Pierro proposed that Zandik take the title Il Dottore, or The Doctor, which Zandik found humorously ironic.
400 years ago, Pierro and Dottore had a hand in the event known as the Tatarasuna Tatarasuna Mystery Tatarasuna Mystery where Dottore infiltrated the Mikage Furnace as a Fontaine mechanic by the name "Escher" to sabotage the nation per Pierro's order. Upon finishing the mission, Dottore offered to introduce a certain Scaramouche puppet to Pierro, expected to make it their new comrade if it proved useful, otherwise it would be disposed of. Later on, Pierro encountered the puppet and recruited him to the Fatui, who would later become Scaramouche.The Kabukimono's Finale Pierro would send Scaramouche on very important tasks, which also included trips into the Abyss, and for unknown reasons told Scaramouche about his history with the Traveler's Sibling.
At some point, Pierro also recruited Rosalyne-Kruzchka Lohefalter, who had become the infamous Crimson Witch of Flames, to join the Fatui. He gave her the codename La Signora and bestowed her with a Cryo Delusion in order to suppress the intense flames flowing through her body.Ashen Heart
When Tartaglia became a Harbinger and received his Delusion, Pierro was the one to pin it on him.
Present
During the event Unreconciled Stars, while Pierro does not make a personal appearance, he was responsible for sending Scaramouche to Liyue. While investigating the meteor at Musk Reef, Scaramouche makes a discovery: '"The stars, the sky... It's all a gigantic hoax. A lie."' Believing that Pierro had foreseen the meteorite showers and the discovery he would make, Scaramouche leaves in an irritable mood, presumably to confront the senior Harbinger.Where Ancient Stars Align
It is currently assumed that Pierro is the "First Lord Harbinger" mentioned in Borenka's Orders, who masterminded the Fatui's involvement in Inazuma.Clean House note=Borenka's Orders To prolong the war, create a demand for Delusions, and secure their supply of materials to create more Delusions, Pierro sent Nathan to infiltrate the Watatsumi Army, sabotage their efforts, and create chaos on Yashiori Island. Scaramouche was also dispatched to oversee the Delusion Factory's operations,Delusion (Quest) while Signora manipulated the Kanjou Commission and otherwise continued her mission of collecting the Gnosis Gnoses. After the Fatui's actions were exposed, Pierro had an order sent to Borenka to withdraw from Yashiori Island and bring back the few Shogunate renegades to him as test subjects for an unknown experiment.

<title>Tsaritsa</title>
<text>Her Royal Highness the Tsaritsa is actually a gentle soul. Too gentle, in fact, and that's why she had to harden herself. Likewise, she declared war against the whole world only because she dreams of peace.
The Tsaritsa ru=Царица ru_rm=Tsaritsa, her Ars Goetia Goetic name and corresponding ideal yet unknown, is the Cryo Archon among The Seven who presides over Snezhnaya.
With supreme rule over Snezhnaya, she uses her loyal followers in the Fatui to manipulate and intimidate the other nations of Teyvat. She is targeting the other Archons' Gnoses for reasons unknown, though it likely relates to her goal of "burning away the old world."
The Tsaritsa also has the ability to grant her subjects a power separate from Visions, called Delusions. High-ranking Fatui such as Fatui Pyro Agent Fatui Agents, Fatui Cicin Mages, Mirror Maidens, Fatui Operatives and the Eleven Fatui Harbingers use them.

Introduction
Sorry... to also have you shoulder the grievances of the world.Since you could endure my bitter cold, you must have the desire to burn?Then, burn away the old world for me.|The Tsaritsa
The Tsaritsa is not one of the original members of The Seven who emerged victorious at the end of the Archon War. When and how she ascended to the position of Cryo Archon is yet unknown, but it was some time before the cataclysm 500 years ago which left her deeply changed.Ending Note
In the Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview, Dainsleif says of the Tsaritsa and Snezhnaya: '"She is a god with no love left for her people, nor do they have any left for her. Her followers only hope to be on her side when the day of her rebellion against the divine comes at last."' This most likely refers to Celestia, or someone or something located on Celestia.
Appearance
Nothing is known about the Tsaritsa's appearance besides the fact that she uses a female vessel. Her gaze is described as "cold but pure," and it is also suggested she wields a scepter.
Story
History
At some point in the history of The Seven, the Tsaritsa inherited her position from the previous Cryo Archon. She is not the original archon who emerged victorious from the Archon War. She witnessed the events of the cataclysm, which left her severely embittered.
When Il Dottore and Pierro returned with a Scaramouche unique kabukimono from Inazuma after paving the way for future endeavors by sabotaging the Mikage Furnace, the Tsaritsa had the puppet lead expeditions into the Abyss for reasons unknown.
Archon Quests
While the Tsaritsa does not appear in any quests, her Harbingers enforce her will and goal of rebelling against the divine, having tasked them with obtaining her fellow Archons' Gnoses. She has Signora collect the Gnoses, first having Signora take Barbatos' by force due to the animosity between the two. She negotiated with Morax for his Gnosis, offering him something that he accepted as the "contract to end all contracts." After Paimon inquired as to what she offered, Morax's vessel, Zhongli, informed her and the Traveler that they would find out themselves in their journey across Teyvat.The Fond Farewell
In Sumeru, Il Dottore claimed that the Tsaritsa had called them back to Snezhnaya, though through the use of his segments, was able to successfully acquire both the Electro Gnosis that Scaramouche had previously taken and gone missing with along with the Dendro Gnosis held by Lesser Lord Kusanali after negotiating with her.
Lyney claims that the Tsaritsa has allowed The Knave Arlecchino to use the Hydro Gnosis to resolve the disaster foretold by the prophecy of the Primordial Sea before handing it to the Tsaritsa.Lies Cast Shadows Under Gathered Lights She would later acquire it from Arlecchino, who had been given it from Neuvillette as a "diplomatic gift."

<title>Golden Apple Archipelago</title>
<text>The Golden Apple Archipelago is a limited time summer event area located east of Mondstadt that first appeared in Version 1.6 and appeared again in Version 2.8 in the Summertime Odyssey event with a different look. It was historically known as the Haar Islands before the events of Midsummer Island Adventure. This area contains a set of islands that the Dodo-King invited Klee to in the quest Mysterious Islands: Journey to the Unknown.
The archipelago is the first location released where the player can be introduced to the Waverider Game Systems system.
Many of the archipelago's elements have later reappeared at Inazuma.
History
Golden Apple Archipelago/History
These islands are isolated from the outside world, like a secret Domain crafted by nature itself.
According to Venti, the archipelago used to be called the Haar Islands. The islands were created during the terraforming of Mondstadt; as Barbatos reshaped the region, he split off the tops from mountains which then landed upside-down in the sea, becoming the archipelago.Event Echoing Tales Conch Retrospection, VI: Familiar Voices - Echoing Tales Story VI: Familiar Voices An Archon's Deeds Lisa also mentions it "belonging to no nation", likely meaning it is located in neutral waters.Mysterious Islands: Journey to the Unknown
The area appears to be operated by an unusually large mechanism that has not yet been revealed.Summer Vacation: Proceed With Caution Initially, the islands were covered in dense fog, which made travel to the islands extremely dangerous and inaccessible to most. This, along with the changing tides and winds, also made it difficult to escape once anyone made it to the islands. While hilichurls can be found on the archipelago both before and after the islands' rising, it is unknown if the hilichurls had been there first or somehow sailed to it.
Civilization began on the Haar Islands with one shipwrecked group that lived on the archipelago for many generations. Many people tried escaping; it remains unknown if any of them were successful. Around 500 years later, Ako Domeki and his pirate fleet were shipwrecked on the island after Asase Hibiki unleashed a Thunder Manifestation during a battle between his and the Shogunate's forces on Seirai Island. Domeki's fleet also included a stolen Maguu Kenki samurai puppet that protected the islanders until it was damaged and rendered inactive. Then, with the help of the pirates, an escape route was devised that took advantage of the archipelago's unusual features. As it seemed likely that the escape route would work, everyone left the islands.Event Echoing Tales: Echoing Tales Story Conch Retrospection It is not known what happened to the local inhabitants. However, Domeki and his fleet returned to Seirai Island, which was now in ruins.
Some years after the archipelago became abandoned, the events of Midsummer Island Adventure occurred in the present day. Klee received a letter from "Dodo-King" threatening to take Dodoco away from her unless she could prove herself. With the assistance of the Traveler and Paimon, Klee was able to find the location of the archipelago as well as the means to get there, with Acting Grand Master Jean and Deaconess Barbara also deciding to come with her for her safety. The five were taken to the archipelago by Dvalin, summoned by Venti. There they would begin looking for "Dodo-King" and learn about the archipelago's mysterious history in the process.
The group is eventually joined by Kaeya, Diluc, Albedo, and Razor, who were also flown to the archipelago by Dvalin but became separated when Razor jumped off mid-flight. Each also received a letter from Dodo-King with varying, personal messages catered to their concerns, causing everyone to become wary of the true identity of Dodo-King.
After solving the mystery, it is revealed that Alice, Klee's mother, had brought the group to the archipelago so she could ensure that her daughter had a memorable summer vacation. She had visited the area before and found the scenery and history beautiful and spent some time dressing up the islands for her daughter's enjoyment.</text>

<title>Nahida/Lore</title>
<text>Lesser Lord Kusanali dwells deep in the Sanctuary of Surasthana, and has never really been in the limelight, nor has she even been mentioned much.Her burden is heavy, but though she may experience loneliness, and though darkness is all she sees before her, she will not stop moving forward.
Personality
A caged bird secluded within the confines of the Sanctuary of Surasthana who can only see the world in her dreams.
When the Traveler and Paimon first meet Nahida in the Sabzeruz Festival samsara, she was an elusive and secretive individual. She voluntarily left ruling the city to the sages, though like in cases with the samsara, she would intervene as best she could if they stepped out of line. She also suffered from very low self-esteem as a result of the way the sages treated her. However after the downfall of the sages and the cleansing of Irminsul, many of these traits have minimized or vanished. She now openly wanders around the city, when she has time, and interacts with her people and has an overall far more genuinely cheerful view of herself.
Despite her previously difficult circumstances, when she spoke to people she rarely revealed her sadness. She almost always maintains a gentle and kind demeanour when she speaks to others, and treats everyone as equals. However, she admits that her social skills and understanding of human interaction needs work, and she's prone to slightly eccentric speech and behaviour as a result. She also professes a fondness for analogies and frequently makes use of them when attempting to explain things to others. Like many in Sumeru, she believes in helping people come to answers on their own, particularly regarding heavier truths, rather than providing all the answers. As a result she's also prone to peppering her speech with a mixture of analogies and subtle clues about things she wants others to learn.
As the God of Wisdom, Nahida's most notable traits are her exceptional intelligence, knowledge, and planning. She's capable of creating extremely thorough, multi-layered plans and can even be a little manipulative if the situation calls for it. She's also capable of making plans in a pinch, as shown when she bartered with Dottore. Perhaps most of all, Nahida is skilled at realizing when her intelligence is required and when her kindness is required, or both.
Appearance
For All Knowledge, a Verse
Nahida uses the Short Female Characters short female model. She has fair skin, pointed ears, large green eyes, and white hair with Dendro-green tips that glow when she uses her Elemental Skill or her Elemental Burst.
Official Introduction
Nahida: The panacea brings purity, and from the palace depths is spring renewed
One might say she pays too much attention or dotes on people too much... But while her actions can be flawed, I believe her sense of responsibility as Sumeru's deity to be a commendable thing. Ah, that the youngest of gods should be thus, while Furina a certain other person, by contrast, should be so prone to hysterics...
Lesser Lord Kusanali dwelt deep in the Sanctuary of Surasthana. She had never really been in the limelight, nor had she even been mentioned much.
Always learning something new, she constantly strove to become a worthy archon who could guide her people as soon as possible.
If the threat of forbidden knowledge were not pressing so near, would she not desire to take a short break and see Sumeru and those who live in it with her own eyes?
As things stood, she could only see the myriad, vibrant sights the world had to offer in dreams.
Within the meditative silence of her soul, she made companions of the sunlight and the breeze, struck up friendships with humans and animals, told stories, played, and sang songs she had only just learned...
She poured the loveliest of yearnings into her dreamscape, but no matter how bustling the nights, when day came, all things about her would return to silence once more.
She gradually arose. Even through her sleepiness, solitude struck like an icy tide, causing her to hug her shoulders tightly.
-That which fully awakened her was an inconspicuous yet abnormal noise that sounded within Akasha.
"Ah. So it was a dream within a dream..."
Character Stories
Several of Nahida's Character Stories change after completing the Archon Quest 'Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies'. See the  Altered Character Stories Altered Character Stories section for the alternate versions.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata created Sumeru's rainforest and bestowed wisdom upon the people of Sumeru through Sumeru Akademiya the Akademiya. Despite her departure long ago, her name is still praised in the stories told in every household in Sumeru.On the other hand, Lesser Lord Kusanali, who was whisked back by the sages to the Sanctuary of Surasthana following the former's fall, has been more of a symbol - one that signifies that the protection of divinity never ceased to exist on this land.But the answers to who she is, how she descended, and what powers she has, are rarely known.From the highest sage's vague response and evasive attitude toward people's inquiry about Lesser Lord Kusanali, the people in Sumeru deduced that they should no longer expect merciful wisdom to descend from on high as before.The Akasha, the sublime legacy left by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, is just as handy and helpful as it has always been. What people are not aware of is that the Akasha today has become the ears and eyes of the newborn deity.Through the Akasha, she has observed every bit of human emotions and attitudes. She is aware of their devotion to the old goddess, their disillusionment with their new deity, and the many comments that "The God of Wisdom will never come back."She knows in her heart that she must keep learning and grow up as quickly as she can to stand up and face the threats from the most abysmal corners of the world. This is her inevitable duty.Thus, whether she is misunderstood or underappreciated, Nahida makes no argument against it.
The process of learning and growth is joyful, and knowledge concerning this world always satisfies Nahida's exuberant curiosity.Gradually, Nahida came to grasp the principles of nature and the elements, understanding the ecology of the sky and the sea. She could even compose what she learned into fascinating dreams that are logical, yet beyond imagination.Such dreams are, in essence, the same as Nahida's marvelous metaphors - they all lead to a dawning understanding of the similarities between two otherwise unrelated things.But there are times when she meditates on things yet struggles to figure them out, and such incidents usually concern events related to people or society.For example, when honesty and truth could exempt a person from punishment, some people might turn silent and deceitful; and when with their beloved ones, some people would hurt others with brutal words.It feels as if the contradictions of the entire world are focused through and manifested by human beings, whose fickle emotions are perplexing to Nahida.In such moments, her metaphors would not work. Nor could she find any system in this world as a reference for such chaos.She could only explain it by the fact that the difference between every person's uniqueness creates diverse reactions when they undergo similar emotions.But this was not a satisfactory answer to Nahida. To better know human beings, plain knowledge and dogma alone would never suffice.Perhaps it was from that moment on that Nahida came to understand why "she" had to stand firmly by human beings' side and even made tremendous sacrifices for their sake.For each and every one of "them" is a unique existence in this world.
Nahida's life might be uniform, but she owns the most fantastic and lively dream in all of Sumeru.The knowledge she learns through the Akasha during the day is presented vividly in her dreams at night. As she learns more knowledge, her dreams become even more intricate and full of life.The dreams not only relax her mind, but also give her chances to examine her new knowledge to see if it goes against common sense or if she is missing any details.When Dusk Birds first appeared in Nahida's dream, those birds soared through the sky in a standing posture with their wings folded.It looked abnormal and caught Nahida's attention immediately. Nahida thus learned how wings worked, after which the Dusk Birds could fly freely in her dreams.Next, she adopted similar methods to fix Shroomboars that slept underwater, Radishes that grew on apple trees, and crystalfly crystalflies with mismatched wing colors.Knowledge shall not be a mere approach to justify things in this world, it could also be used to satisfy her need for pure innocent fun.Technically, Shroomboars can only walk on the ground. Now that she understood how wings work, wouldn't Shroomboars with wings fly all the same?And where there are flying Shroomboars, it is only natural to have crocodiles that walk on their hind legs and Harra Fruits who speak human languages...The way Nahida develops her knowledge system has subsequently created a little amusement park for her, free of disturbance. In her dreams, she is in the embrace of boundless happiness.
Children have yet to be well-informed and are easily swayed by emotions, but it does not mean that they can be disrespected or mocked.Frustration and disappointments do indeed grant them a taste of reality - but at the cost of robbing them of innocent thoughts and exuberant emotions.The children who unluckily run across such negativity would always hear a gentle, warm voice on some ordinary night.She listens attentively to the children, uses her wonderful metaphors to clarify principles to them, plays with them, and talks about their favorite games and snacks... until dawn.Though the night is short, such company would let the children believe that there is still someone in this world who understands them.Hatred and frustration are thus melted away by the warmth in their hearts, and the children would gain an opportunity to make a change in their lives such that they can grow in confidence and gladness.However, none of them could recognize to whom the gentle, warm voice belonged. Everyone knows, after all, that Greater Lord Rukkhadevata had departed a long time ago.A group of children gathered in secret and discussed this mystical phenomenon. Suddenly, a child who seemed to know a lot more than their peers mentioned a somewhat unusual name, "Lesser Lord Kusanali."They soon accepted that theory. And, of course, none of their parents believed them.But what did that matter? Lesser Lord Kusanali was already their friend.
The greenery-planning personnel in Sumeru City once received a mysterious letter. The sender was, apparently, "An Enthusiastic and Perfectly Leisurely Citizen of Sumeru City."The letter contained detailed suggestions and thoughtful planning that took both the weather and practicality into consideration.Judging by the professionalism of the letter's contents, it was natural to assume that the letter was from a well-known Amurta researcher who would prefer to stay anonymous.Despite the writer's anonymity, the greenery-planning personnel carried out their work in the city exactly as stated in the letter, as if they were implementing orders from their superior.The outcome reaped high praise. Later one day, Nahida borrowed Katheryne's body and took a walk on the streets in the city. To her great joy, she found out that the arrangement of plants was exactly the same as she had expected.The letter was from Nahida, of course. She had written it because she thought that though knowledge is important, practice is also essential.But with the exceedingly strict control the sages exercised, Nahida had to persuade them with great effort before they agreed to let her send this seemingly useless letter anonymously.But so encouraged was Nahida by the great success of her first attempt at putting knowledge into practice that in the following days, even when she walked, she was ever so full of elated confidence.But then she rounded a corner and noticed unexpectedly that several flowers of completely mismatched colors had been planted together.After careful examination, she found out that it was because she had not considered the possibility that one of the flower species might change colors, nor had she specified the cultivation environment for the flowers very strictly in her plans.Then it occurred to her that this bunch of flowers could have been here for dozens of days, during which everyone might have witnessed her "complete lack of aesthetic sense"...That day, many claimed that they saw Ms. Katheryne, who usually stood behind the reception desk with a confident smile, crouching next to a pot of flowers, her hands covering her blushing face.
How might one eradicate the threat that forbidden knowledge poses to Irminsul?Nahida used to believe that she was the one who had the answer, but never did she realize that she was also the answer herself.One who takes action will certainly leave one's traces behind. When one wishes to eradicate oneself, a paradox would thus occur.That is why it is inevitable that one must depend on others to accomplish this goal.By the time Nahida had figured this out, time was running out, leaving her no room for further consideration. The knowledge accumulated through the years could not even help her find a solution to the pressing dilemma before her.But just as ████ said, as one with wisdom, one should feel joy upon the discovery of the answer.She was not born just to accomplish such cruel deeds. Only after eradicating forbidden knowledge could she focus on Sumeru's future and plan for the prosperity and happiness that her nation could call its own.Will a nation walking into the future still remember a name that no longer exists? It does not matter."Does it really not matter?"Nahida would have definitely proposed otherwise. Shame, then, that their time was too short. In that blink of an eye, ████ did not even leave her a chance to retort.
Though it looks no different from a regular box, this container has a variety of experimental replicas within it.Nahida has a strong interest in popular games of all sorts. Their rules are simple, but they are also fun and profound. Be it puzzles or battle games, the fascination they inspire can be long-lasting.Games are simple but not simplistic, exemplifying the wisdom of their designers. Deconstructing and reshaping things also make for valuable opportunities to learn.However, the Akademiya researchers never supported her novel ideas, nor would they satisfy her wish for more toys. So, she compromised and asked for only wood and some tools.Following the instructions offered by the Akasha and applying her imagination, she managed to create various toys, such as chessboards, cards, puzzle pieces, and three-dimensional locks...The sense of achievement from finishing making toys brought Nahida brief satisfaction, but she soon found this out:She could not find an opponent for any battle-type games, and as the maker, she knew the solutions to all her puzzle games."If only there were someone else around to try these out."So she has always hoped. But before that suitable person shows up, these toys shall stay in their box for now.
The existence of the Akasha is the means, not an end in itself. The moment when the forbidden knowledge was eradicated was the moment when the Akasha had accomplished its mission.The Doctor The one who had coveted the power of the Gnosis had written the entire drama from the start, and would show themselves as the curtains fell.Nahida, using the Gnosis of a Inazuma foreign land as leverage, deprived the cunning foe of his "segments" as insurance.But the enemy immediately requested for a bargain as well, offering up critical knowledge of the world's "truth."His knowledge of the values rooted in this land was without peer, and thus had he intended to take advantage of Nahida's curiosity and sense of responsibility from the very beginning. Indeed, the way he saw it, there could be no bargaining chip more suitable than knowledge.With one Gnosis still in her hands, Nahida could not help but hesitate. She barely knew more about the Gnoses than she knew the "truth" of the world.The Gnosis, to her, was but a core that gathers a mass of elemental power at her discretion. But if there is nothing more to a Gnosis, why was a god so eager to gather all of them together?Shaking hands in bargain means an equal compromise for both sides, a far cry from any victory. On the other hand, turning down the bargain indicates a certain type of "ignorance," which, obviously, would more easily invite a loss of control.Thus did the "God of Wisdom" instantly find her answer...
Altered Character Stories
After completing the Archon Quest 'Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies', some of Nahida's Character Stories are altered to the following versions.
Long ago, the Dendro Archon created Sumeru's rainforest and bestowed wisdom upon the people of Sumeru through the Akademiya. Her name is praised in thousands of stories that are written to admire her deeds and virtues.In the eyes of people in Sumeru, the existence of the Dendro Archon is more of a symbol - by which they ascertain that the protection of divinity upon this land has persisted since antiquity.The Dendro Archon is revered by the highest sages in Sumeru City and venerated by the citizens unswervingly.And the powerful Akasha System is Lesser Lord Kusanali's eyes and ears.The Akasha enables her to observe and learn about people's emotions and gives her omnipresent sight and hearing so
The process of learning and growth is joyful, and knowledge concerning this world always satisfies Nahida's exuberant curiosity.Gradually, Nahida came to grasp the principles of nature and the elements, understanding the ecology of the sky and the sea. She could even compose what she learned into fascinating dreams that are logical, yet beyond imagination.Such dreams are, in essence, the same as Nahida's marvelous metaphors - they all lead to a dawning understanding of the similarities between two otherwise unrelated things.But there are times when she meditates on things yet struggles to figure them out, and such incidents usually concern events related to people or society.For example, when honesty and truth could exempt a person from punishment, some people might turn silent and deceitful; and when with their beloved ones, some people would hurt others with brutal words.It feels as if the contradictions of the entire world are focused through and manifested by human beings, whose fickle emotions are perplexing to Nahida.In such moments, her metaphors would not work. Nor could she find any system in this world as a reference for such chaos.She could only explain it by the fact that the difference between every person's uniqueness creates diverse reactions when they undergo similar emotions.But this was not a satisfactory answer to Nahida. To better know human beings, plain knowledge and dogma alone would never suffice.Perhaps it was from that moment on that Nahida came to understand why ████ had to stand firmly by human beings' side and even made tremendous sacrifices for their sake.For each and every one of "them" is a unique existence in this world.
Children have yet to be well-informed and are easily swayed by emotions, but it does not mean that they can be disrespected or mocked.Frustration and disappointments do indeed grant them a taste of reality - but at the cost of robbing them of innocent thoughts and exuberant emotions.The children who unluckily run across such negativity would always hear a gentle, warm voice on some ordinary night.She listens attentively to the children, uses her wonderful metaphors to clarify principles to them, plays with them, and talks about their favorite games and snacks... until dawn.Though the night is short, such company would let the children believe that there is still someone in this world who understands them.Hatred and frustration are thus melted away by the warmth in their hearts, and the children would gain an opportunity to make a change in their lives such that they can grow in confidence and gladness.However, none of them could recognize to whom the voice in their dreams belonged. The Dendro Archon is powerful, but she must have many more important matters to attend to.And so, the children gathered in secret and discussed this mysterious phenomenon. Numerous were the possibilities they came up with, and they discussed at length about each imaginative explanation.But in the end, the conclusion was, unsurprisingly, that only Lesser Lord Kusanali could be capable of a deed so kind and caring. Or, to put it otherwise, that was the only conclusion that these children were willing to believe in.And, of course, none of their parents believed them. But what did that matter? Lesser Lord Kusanali was already their friend.

<title>Wriothesley/Lore</title>
<text>Administrator of the Fortress of Meropide, he was given Fontaine's highest honorary title of "Duke." Both low-profile and dependable.
Personality
Duke of the Fortress of Meropide, Lord Incognito of the murky depths.
Wriothesley is the "Duke" of the Fortress of Meropide, serving as the prison's administrator and overseeing the facility's overall status. Despite his appearance, Wriothesley is fairly calm and collected, not worrying too much about the prison's infamous reputation as he only sees himself as a "leader" of sorts to oversee the population and ensuring they have the "tranquility" they desire. He sees the prison as a place of rebirth and is willing to protect that way of life, not wanting others to suffer like he once did, and becomes extremely angered should such a circumstance occur on his watch. His relaxed policies has made him very popular among many inmates, who tend to address him as if he was nobility, due to being bestowed the title of "Duke" by the Palais Mermonia.
While he owns a pair of mechanical gauntlets for use in fighting, he is not an advocate for violence, not wanting to get more blood on his hands. However, he is willing to kill others should he have no choice to maintain law and order.
Outside of his duties, he enjoys drinking tea.
Appearance
Night's Chilling Howl
Wriothesley uses the Tall Male Characters tall male model. He has tufted black hair with grey streaks, pale grey eyes, and pale skin, and utilizes the tall male model. He bears a scar beneath his right eye; three scars extending from high on his neck down to his mid-chest, with one on the right, one on the left, and one along the midline; and scars on his left and right forearms.
Official Introduction
Wriothesley: Guilty waters run deep
Navia, do you remember when I refused the title of 'Baron' bestowed upon me by the Palais Mermonia a few years back? Well, that's beside the point. Today, I finally met the Administrator of the Fortress of Meropide. I had always assumed that 'Duke' was simply a hollow title too... But it turns out that Wriothesley is far more worldly than he looks.
"Administrator of the Fortress of Meropide"
— If Wriothesley needed a namecard, this would suffice.
No foreword, and no epilogue. Just like that place of exiled convicts he's in charge of, standing there silently at the bottom of the sea.
Despite its discretion, as a resting place for criminals, the Fortress of Meropide harbors a network of conflicting interests that would have a corrupting influence on many.
But even if someone was bent on infiltrating this place, they'd soon be swallowed up like breadcrumbs in a bowl of soup.
Some have lauded His Grace's aptitude for taking care of thorny problems. Hearing such praise, Wriothesley would simply lower his teacup... and pick up his newspaper.
"You've got the wrong end of the stick. They just wanted somewhere to lead well-ordered lives, and I gave them the 'tranquility' they required."
Character Stories
To the great relief of the Maison Ordalie, most Fontainians are law-abiding citizens. As such, the Fortress of Meropide is not a place that they will ever visit in their lives.At the same time, there is an easily understood yet rather tragic truth, which is that those who have served time often find it difficult to reintegrate back into the "overworld," and few will actively speak of their experiences in the "underworld."Rather than a specific place, the Fortress is more like an idea, a warning, a symbol of misfortune and castigation - a byword amongst Fontainians. As for who controls this idea, that is unimportant.Thanks to this state of affairs, Wriothesley has been able to lead a secluded and private existence, living and traveling in Fontaine in a manner quite unbefitting of his status as the "Duke."Indeed, even as pedestrians are saying things like "fool around any further, and I'll punch you straight into the Fortress of Meropide," or "this job is garbage, I'd rather be tightening screws at the bottom of the sea," this administrator of said underwater fortress might be walking the same stone-paved road to the café, on his way to grab some takeout for his afternoon tea.
Wriothesley does not, in fact, leave the Fortress often. Using the network of information and connections that he has personally built up over the years, he can gain any intelligence or resources he needs from the comfort of his office.However, he is also aware of one principle, which is that he cannot be imprisoned in that office by the host of duties that assails him, or he will either never get a good night’s sleep, or soon find himself sleeping forever beneath the waves.Only two things are necessary for him to run this place comfortably: Mora and manpower.Fortunately, the Fortress itself is a giant factory, and he has quite the knack for making money - why, even the Palais Mermonia is one of his valued customers. Very importantly, giving the Palais some extra care is not considered to be hankering after power, and the Court of Fontaine for its part has little power of oversight over the Fortress, and thus simply represents valued customers and Mora - the more of both, the better. As such, Wriothesley is happy to comply with the Maison Gestion’s exhaustively strict demands for proper documentation.(The Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering's incredible demand for Arkhium might have once made it a match for the Palais, but ever since the Institute became a mid-air tourist attraction, it has been forced to withdraw from the partnership. Till we meet again for another big contract, valued customer.)One of the most common pitfalls for the immensely wealthy is over-valuing money and undervaluing people. This is, again, where Wriothesley is a fortunate man, for he was not born rich, and thus knows how important it is to get along with others.He treats all who live at the Fortress equally. Be they criminals, guards, or ordinary staff, so long as they do what they should as they should, he will not nitpick.But as for those who overstep their station - well then, words must be had. The underwater space they dwell in is quite enclosed, and for most, there is nowhere else to go. If possible, of course, Wriothesley would prefer everyone to be reasonable, but where reasoned words fail, he will use even more persuasive means.Occasionally overlooking the trivial, meaningless, but inevitable clashes between people is fair enough. Most people know better than to raise a real stink, while as for those who don’t... there are places where they can go. Just as flowing water can cleanse itself, so can a functioning society get rid of its rot.As such, not only has Wriothesley not been worked into oblivion, he has even found himself significant amounts of free time.Once, the famous Champion Duelist Clorinde paid him a visit, and said this in passing: "Why does it feel like you have even more free time than me? Your title wasn’t bought, was it?""One moment, please."So saying, Wriothesley rifled through three drawers before producing several thick documents with a flourish. "Now, let me see... 'excellent management'... 'leading tax contributor'... 'specially granted this title...' Well, what do you know? Good guess, that's pretty much what happened after all."
No titles may be bought in Fontaine, which prides itself upon impartial justice - certainly not with Mora. That idle exchange between Wriothesley and Clorinde was pure nonsense, just a bit of verbal horsing around to liven up an otherwise bone-dry business interaction.However, while the title of "Duke" itself was not bought, Wriothesley's accession to administrator of the Fortress of Meropide cannot be separated from "money."Credit Coupons serve the role of currency within the Fortress. Here, Coupons are the medium of exchange, and this has been the case for a very long time, with only the details differing. When Wriothesley was incarcerated here as an inmate, trade in Coupons was much freer, and the range of items that could be bought more comprehensive. So long as you had enough of them in your pocket, you could obtain harmful drugs, know the winner of fixed matches, buy the hearts of people sitting on the fence, and even take away the right of others to continue breathing.Many of these were extralegal trades, but even the official channels had their various special tricks, too. If you lacked private connections, you could only buy food and water at exorbitant prices, and your fortune slip would not be some adage of unknown providence, but real, practical, extra work you had to finish by the end of the workday. Coupons in those days resembled nothing so much as the previous administrator's tool for controlling inmates.Hurling lawbreakers into a lawless chaos to fend for themselves was indeed one way of doing things, but Wriothesley could not approve of it. He was perfectly willing to adapt to his environment, but if the environment was not suited for survival in the first place, then he certainly wasn't going to take this lying down.He spent a great deal of time accumulating capital in the underground arena and used that money to make still more. He was always the observant type, and was quite persuasive, too, not to mention humble and reasonable - so before anyone knew it, he had already accumulated more Coupons than everyone else in the Fortress combined.This accumulated wealth made him a man of high repute amongst his fellow inmates. And just as Wriothesley expected, the hammer of punishment soon came swinging down. In a single night, his Coupon account was emptied in one cruel stroke by the Fortress's administrator.But as noted before, Wriothesley had a knack for convincing others. Words have the power to incite, and so long as all residents of the Fortress, rich and poor, understood that they could suffer a similar fate under such management, they would speak up for him. And if he acted in a sufficiently upright manner in a sufficiently impressive setting, others would join with him to fill the void in their hearts.As such, he challenged the Fortress' previous administrator to a duel, in the name of fairness, justice, and order. Of course, their respective standings made poor grounds for this fight even at the best of times, but on that day, not a soul, inmate or guard, said a word in protest.Very fortunately, said administrator's last-minute flight saved Wriothesley from having to get another person’s blood on his hands. But unfortunately, that day was also the day he would have finished serving his sentence, but with the administrator missing, there was no one to sign his exit papers.And so, he walked into the office in the middle of the Fortress, and took over all relevant duties.
After he obtained access to old court documents, Wriothesley pulled out his own case file. There wasn't much in it, but even that was already all that the Fontaine authorities had been able to uncover at the time. According to the accounting ledger of his host family, he had been taken in as an abandoned infant - beyond that, there was no more relevant information.While browsing through his file, Wriothesley encountered some names that he had vague impressions of, and some other foggy faces briefly floated into view before fading to the sound of turning pages. Had he been willing, he could have used his connections to discover how these old companions were faring, but he dismissed those thoughts even as they entered his mind.To them, he must represent a past they no longer wished to recall, and to him, these names no longer constituted any part of his life. He had a new identity, a new home, and new friends.This was a strange experience for him. He'd met and known many people, and of all of them, very few could be considered friends - and he even knew quite a few who weren't human at all, something he puts down to Melusines really enjoying hanging out with humans. Their appearance belies their age, but the goodwill they show humans truly does have an innocence that only one's elders may have, a belief that these young human souls are good-hearted to begin with, and thus worthy of all care and faith in the infinite possibilities their futures hold.Wriothesley himself has benefitted from this many times. When he was out on the streets with only the clothes on his back, it was a passing Melusine who gave him some hot soup. When he did not return completely unharmed from his bouts in the ring, Sigewinne would be waiting to greet him cheerily in the infirmary - not to mention how the officers of the Marechaussee Phantom have always been, within legal limits, his greatest help in investigating certain secret affairs.As such, he tacitly permits their visits to the Fortress, even if this can sometimes mean unneeded trouble. As for anything they might need to know, the Head Nurse warns them, and there's no need to go into details. In any case, anyone so capable of pasting stickers everywhere while he's not looking is hardly someone whose well-being he needs to worry too much about.
Watching the crimson stain spread across the floorboards, a wildly inappropriate thought entered Wriothesley's mind. How many Melusine officers would it take to investigate all the traces of blood in this place?His thoughts then immediately leapt elsewhere. To think that his blood was so like that of those who had deceived him that they could run together, melding effortlessly. How revolting.But he had lost all capacity to vomit. Indeed, he could not move a muscle if he tried. Thought and warmth had both faded, and his mind had begun to fill with a seeping, murky fog - there was nothing in his life till now worth remembering.But he did not die. Fate, it seemed, wanted him to live with the burden of sin, and so when he woke up in his hospital bed, both of his hands had been cuffed to the metal rails. A well-dressed woman was looking at him nervously from her distant chair. No doubt, she considered him to be some manner of young psychopath.Producing pen and paper, she asked for his name, and he paused for a good long time. His thoughts drifted to an obituary he once saw in the papers, in which there was a person who had lived to a ripe old age bearing a long and complicated name. He didn't particularly like it, but he no longer wished to use the one his foster parents had given him.Thus did the woman write "Wriothesley" down, and inform him of his trial date (which was, would you know it, the day the doctors expected him to be able to get out of bed), before hurriedly taking her leave.The trial itself went very smoothly, which he was grateful for. The blood he had spilled had stained his hands and taken root in his heart, driving him to yearn for a just conviction. He told all present of the full circumstances around the killing, and even added some details, such that there was no real room for argument in this case. Argue they still did, though, first on the matter of past cases related to orphans in an inconclusive search for any precedent patterns, and then somehow for clemency, believing that the people he'd taken vengeance on were villains themselves in the first place, and that he should thus not have to bear the burden of guilt.This background noise did not change the ultimate result of the trial, and no sooner was it over than he was sent beneath the sea to serve time. Before he was to depart, the Gestionnaire in charge of recording his sentence asked him once again for his personal particulars."You're... Wriothesley, then? Your birthday, please.""...Today."
Wriothesley’s mechanical gauntlets have gone through a great many iterations.Their origin can be traced back to his escape from his foster home. Given his age and constitution then, it was impossible for him to deal with a single adult, let alone more. As such, he was forced to try his luck on the streets, picking up odd jobs and doing apprenticeships, learning the art of lockpicking and the creation of small gadgets. He wanted to make sure that he would be well-equipped when he finally returned to destroy that accursed place.He fashioned a wrist-mounted device that could launch iron nails at high speed, penetrating any sufficiently soft surface. Unfortunately, it had limited uses, and lost all ability to function after a battle, just like him - and unlike him, it could not be saved.In the past, the underground pankration fights of the Fortress of Meropide had neither a fixed venue nor set rules. To win and keep earning, he had to constantly modify his gauntlets, because a trick you used once could be used against you the next time. Furthermore, even if he didn’t render them scrap on the field, they could still be stolen or wrecked in some other way by others. He certainly had to start over countless times.Once he had the ability to garner better materials, his progress began to accelerate. He no longer needed to rely on chemicals to power the mechanism, and he would gain the support of professionals hailing from the Fontaine Research Institute. Those researchers enjoyed explaining the principles of mechanics to him even as they bellyached about all sorts of outrageous matters that occurred at the Institute. This, Wriothesley found fascinating - technological development increased the number of crimes that were committed, but they could also aid in solving them. Was that development then good or bad? That was hard to say.At that point, he no longer participated in matches all that often, with the gauntlets being saved for dealing with the trickiest of problems. They no longer took life, and instead brought him great praise and respect.But the people of the Fortress also know little of the crime he once committed. The only one who still remembers it like yesterday is Wriothesley himself. And no matter how much glory or repute he has earned, he still considers himself to be the same old Wriothesley he's always known.Neither a good person, nor a complete villain. He's just another soul, still living on in this world.
"But thusly do the ancient writers concur - 'Oceans will rise, empires will fall, and the only constant is change.'"After dealing with the spies that the Fatui planted, Wriothesley took a bit of a swim in the seas around the Fortress. He spent very little time in there, finding afterward that his skin had flushed a slight red tint, though it returned to normal shortly afterward. He did not go to the infirmary for a checkup, nor did he intend to reveal this to anyone. All manner of recent signs had indicated that the prophecy was gradually coming to pass, and all people, regardless of whether they believed in it or not, had their own views on the matter, and did not really need this extra information.He had encountered some inmates with academic research backgrounds, though their numbers were relatively few, and they were prone to mad babbling even when clear-headed. They called this a malady common to all historians, and begged his forbearance in the matter. Wriothesley, of course, did not mind, and indeed, he was very interested in their arguments. And according to some schools of thought, if rising and falling were common in this world, then that great sea that once swallowed Remuria may perhaps return someday. In that sense, the prophecy was not really a prophecy, then, but was instead the expression of a rational pattern.As with many other things, he was somewhat on the fence about this reasoning. The Fortress was no stranger to issues that needed "mediation," with eyewitnesses often giving different testimonies. As such, he would reserve judgment on all records, and especially historical chronicles, for was poetic exaggeration not common practice in such writing? "Even the great dragon beneath the abyssal depths submitted to his power..." And how was anyone to know if this so-called great dragon was not just some very large vishap?Once all embellishments were removed, what still remained were the actual things he needed to take note of.Throughout his as-yet unfinished life, Wriothesley has always seemed to be preparing for something. No matter what, he does not wish for people to be ruled by terror. And once the personal element of fear has been removed, what remains is something more akin to a sense of danger. He would like to make some preparations in response to the crisis, even if it might prove futile in the end.History is, after all, vast and terrible, and humanity is no more than seashells to be smashed upon the seashore by its great waves. Thus, he began to prepare for the creation of the Wingalet, expending vast resources and employing much manpower, though he did not put more stock into its success. It was a ship designed for fleeing disaster - an insurmountable chasm lay between it and golden Fortuna, bringer of civilization and glory.Nonetheless, if it could indeed serve its purpose, Jurieu and Lourvine's many quarrels would not have been for naught."Thusly do the ancient writers concur - 'Oceans will rise, empires will fall, and the only constant is change.'"
Standing before the registration counter at the Fortress, Wriothesley reached into his pocket to produce the sheet of paper that had his name and the length of his sentence on it.But out with that sheet also came a glass ball about the size of his palm.No, wait, this wasn’t just some random glass ball. Wriothesley blinked. When had he come into possession of this?The person at the desk - a stern-looking lady with a wrinkled face - gasped, before steadying her shocked expression, gripping her pen tighter. Her lips moved, and moved again, but at last closed."She must have a lot of experience about living here," he immediately thought, and so he did his best to hold the Vision in his palm, before asking in a small voice, "Miss, may I ask..."The senior registrar did not reply. She took the slip of paper from him and looked coldly behind him, as if sizing up the next criminal who'd come to register. However, when she had finished filling the necessary information in, she had written something unnecessary in the margins of the documents she passed back to him. "Hide it well."Wriothesley realized immediately that life at the Fortress would be even harder than roaming the streets.He felt fortunate that he had blocked everyone behind him from seeing what had happened, and more fortunate still that this kind-hearted registrar had been willing to give him a reminder. Sadly, he would not see her again, though this was no surprise, since staff turnover at the Fortress was quite high in those days.The first thing he did upon officially entering the Fortress was to quietly unravel a few threads of his clothing before using fine wire to sew his Vision into the space between the layers of fabric.He knew a thing or two about being homeless - certainly, that the biggest problem was never getting a hold of resources, but keeping them. People could not avoid sleeping, and occasionally being defenseless. The things you owned could be taken away with ease once you were asleep, and no one would call it a robbery.And a Vision was no ordinary treasure. There were sure to be those who would be interested in it for various reasons, and Vision wielders were often magnets for ill-intentioned gazes.In the days that followed, his suspicions would be verified, for in gossip alone he heard of two to three Vision thefts. As for what happened afterward and the fate of the victims, various inconsistent rumors existed that Wriothesley pretended to pay little mind to.He still felt quite fortunate, of course, but it was hard to feel genuine happiness at staying safe off the backs of other peoples' tragic fates.For a long time afterward, he would pretend that he had not been favored by the gods, and in truth, it was not hard - merely a return to his scrappy past. He could handle that much.This persisted until a time when his age had nearly doubled, and he received an official invitation from the Palais Mermonia.Common practice dictated that citizens who were to receive an honorary title must attend an investiture ceremony, and said ceremony was said to be far more involved for the granting of a title such as "Duke."Wriothesley tactfully declined attending the ceremony on the grounds of his unique duties, expressing the desire to simply sign and take the relevant certificates. Quite un-Fontainian of him, really, to dislike the spotlight and prefer to just muddle along.Many workdays and much correspondence later, the Palais finally agreed.Before leaving the underwater stronghold, Wriothesley took his Vision up once more, for the first time in many years. Weighing it in his palm, he found it lighter than before, and smaller to boot. Finding a good spot on his clothes, he hung it there.The first to comment on it was the Iudex, who was to bestow the title upon him. Neuvillette’s smile was suitably polite, but he somehow seemed more pleased than Wriothesley himself. "Congratulations," said the Iudex. "You have found something you wish to do at last, I see."Wriothesley smiled back by way of reply, but made no further comment.

<title>Elemental Skill</title>
<text>The Elemental Skill - or Skill for short - is a Talent that does not require Energy to use but has a Cooldown period between each use. It is sometimes referred to as E (in reference to the corresponding default hotkey on PC).
Overview
Every character has the Talent associated with the Elemental Skill unlocked by default.
Upon using the Elemental Skill, a Cooldown period will initiate, varying between each Elemental Skill. The Cooldown period's length is dictated by the CD stat of the Elemental Skill. The Elemental Skill cannot be used during the Cooldown period. After the Cooldown period passes, the player can immediately use the Elemental Skill again. Cooldown can be reduced, reset, or extended by certain Talents, Constellations, and other effects.
Some skills can be used more than one time or otherwise accept more than one skill use input before entering Cooldown, such as Diluc's Elemental Skill and Fischl's Elemental Skill. The effects of inputting more than one skill use for these skills vary. These skills also vary on whether their cooldown begins counting down immediately or only after the skill's duration expires. In contrast, all skills that only accept one skill use input start their cooldown immediately after use, including skills that are held (their cooldown does not begin until the hold finishes).
Some Elemental Skills for characters have multiple Charges, meaning they can be used multiple times in succession. The number of Charges is indicated by the number of small squares on the Elemental Skill icon.
Some Elemental Skills have different behavior depending on whether the Elemental Skill button is tapped or held. Elemental Skills with a hold attack are usually more powerful when held, but in return require a longer Cooldown.
Elemental Skills also always deal Black Elemental DMG instead of Physical DMG.
Most Elemental Skills generate Energy Elemental Particles when dealing damage to an enemy.
A special case is Tartaglia's Elemental Skill, which allows him to switch between two different stances, ranged and melee. When switching to the Melee stance, the stats of the Elemental Skill affect the Normal Attack, meaning all Elemental Skill DMG is done through the Normal Attack. Its Cooldown also depends on how long the player stays in Melee stance.

<title>Tartaglia/Lore</title>
<text>Meet Tartaglia - the cunning Snezhnayan whose unpredictable personality keeps people guessing his every move.
Don't be under any illusion as to what he might be thinking or what his intentions are. Just remember this: Behind that innocent, childlike exterior lies a finely honed instrument of war.
Personality
No. 11 of The Harbingers, also known as "Childe." His name is highly feared on the battlefield.
Tartaglia describes himself as "kind of a bad guy", living for the thrill of a fight and causing chaos. As a child, Tartaglia was frightened and hesitant, but he secretly desired to become an adventurer like the ones his father told him about as they fished together. After falling into The Abyss and meeting and training with Skirk, Tartaglia's personality drastically changed. Although he appears to relatively friendly on the surface, Tartaglia is a bloodthirsty warrior. The Abyss and his old master, Skirk, made him self-confident, solipsistic, and brash, thriving on the sensation of being alive. A warrior at heart, he constantly seeks ways to grow stronger, regardless of how he obtains said power. Tartaglia considers those who wish to become strong like him to be friends and takes pleasure in battling them on the battlefield. He lusts for combat and grows excited by fighting strong opponents, even if it could mean dying in the process. He uses bows because he is weakest with them, making his victories with them all the more exhilarating.
Because of his pride, Tartaglia is exceptionally reliable at accomplishing the tasks given to him, no matter how difficult they may be or if they go against his values. This, combined with his straightforward nature, makes him rather easy to manipulate. Despite disliking how his plan in Liyue Harbor could potentially harm innocents, he puts it into motion to fulfill his mission in Liyue - only to learn he was meant to fail as part of an even larger plan he was not privy to, much to his consternation.
Amongst the rest of the Harbingers, Tartaglia is considered an oddball. While his fellow Harbingers prefer clandestine operations and staying behind the scenes, Tartaglia favors being front and center. He is a public figure known for attending social gatherings and even participates as an actor in plays and theater. As a result, Childe's coworkers are wary of him, while he holds them in disdain for their schemes and "intangible" methods. While he is easily capable of scheming, he only resorts to such approaches when necessary due to his straightforward nature. He also appears to treat his subordinates less harshly than the rest of the Harbingers, stating that he doesn't use lethal force against the recruits in his care nor does he threaten any of them.
Tartaglia dedicates himself to those he cares about wholeheartedly. He is unquestionably loyal to the Tsaritsa and holds her in high esteem, seeing himself as her weapon of war.YouTube:  He also cares deeply for his family; he sends money, gifts, and letters home often. Tartaglia is exceptionally proud of his three younger siblings and dotes on them frequently, especially his youngest brother Teucer - he is willing to lie and even put himself in mortal danger, so as long as it makes him happy. Although he was once on good terms with Zhongli (even allowing the former Archon to use him as financial support), he seems to have taken his deception personally, stating he will only forgive him if he agrees to trial by combat. Zhongli appears to be unaware of Tartaglia's change in opinion, being under the impression he will still meet him for drinks to catch up after the recent Liyue events.
Appearance
Blades of Glory
Tartaglia uses the Tall Male Characters tall male model. He has short gingerSolitary Fragrance hair and dull blue eyes. He wears a red Fatui mask pulled off to the left side of his head, and a beaded earring with a red crystal on his left ear. A few lighter blond streaks can be seen in his hair, with one prominent one on the left side of his bangs.
Tartaglia wears his Blades of Glory outfit during the first phase of his Golden House battle. After the first phase, Tartaglia's clothes turn from gray to black, he wears his mask on his face, and his Hydro Vision appears to be supplanted by his Electro Delusion. After the second phase, he undergoes a Foul Legacy Transformation full outfit change and becomes larger, and his Vision reappears in the empty slot on his right chest while his Delusion moves to the center of his belt. Both his Vision and Delusion also obtain more prominent black and silver casings.
Official Introduction
Tartaglia:Secrets From the Depths of Winter
One can trust him, but one ought not get too attached. He has unusual tastes when it comes to combat - the encounters he craves the most being those that bring him closest to his own demise.
He cooks, he cleans... He's the bestest big brother ever!
Warm and friendly one minute, ruthless killer the next... His shifting and unpredictable personality can leave those around him at a loss for words to describe him. But in rare, private moments, he dispenses with titles, casts off his armor and the layers of intrigue that come with it, and show his authentic self.
His name is Tartaglia, and he is devoted to the thrill and the physical feel of battle.
Don't be under any illusion as to what he might be thinking or what his intentions are. Just remember this: Behind that innocent, childlike exterior lies a finely honed instrument of war.
Like a velvet sheath that houses an ostensibly ornamental blade, his unpredictability puts people on edge.
Character Stories
Despite holding one of the most senior positions in the Fatui as one of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers Eleven Harbingers, Childe very much looks like the young adult that he still is.He is a wolf in sheep's clothing, however, for under the cheerful and confident appearance lies a deadly swordsman.He is the youngest among the Harbingers, but one of the most dangerous among their number.That said, Childe doesn't seem to fit in well with the others.As a fighter first and foremost, he is quite at odds with this organization of deceit and treachery.
As the youngest Harbinger in the history of the Fatui, Childe is hardly bound by convention, and plays by his own rules accordingly.Though this lone wolf is not so well-received by his peers and is also at odds with their methods, his cavalier demeanor hides a responsible, watertight meticulousness.He is a proud man of his word. Even if the promise he makes is absurd, he will never break it.Be it exterminating all the dragons inside their lairs, venturing into a domain of extreme danger, or single-handedly overthrowing the territory of a nobleman...He not only keeps his promises, but does so with finesse and surgical precision. As the Harbingers' vanguard, Childe always appears in the vulnerable underbellies of Snezhnaya's enemy states, striking as a conflict is about to erupt.
Many myths in Snezhnaya say that Tartaglia has been on the battlefield since he was 14 years old.Oddly enough, at that young age he already seemed to be a skilled slaughterer with mastery of many forms of martial arts.But more terrifying than his skill in combat was his passion for it.Perilous battles would only excite him, and terrifying foes would exhilarate him all the more.Childe's arrogance and conceit are derived from honing himself across countless battles, and from unmatched combat experience.On the other hand, because they fret about the way his quarrelsome personality tends to invite unwanted trouble, the other Harbingers constantly try to get him sent on missions to places as far from Snezhnaya as possible, so that they can avoid the fallout.The man is incomprehensibly ever in the eye of the storm, and these unusual experiences have also made him quite the show-off who revels in the praise of others.Unlike other members of the Harbingers, who prefer to keep a low profile, Tartaglia will often go to watch public performances - occasionally even becoming part of the show himself.
Ice fishing has been one of Tartaglia's hobbies since childhood.In those days, he was known neither by the names Tartaglia nor "Childe," as the Fatui call him, but as Ajax, named by his father after some hero's tale. He and his father would cut holes open upon frozen lakes before sitting beside them and tending to their fishing lines.This was no easy task, and would sometimes take the entire morning.But whether it was chiseling away at the thick ice or the long waits in between catches, he was always accompanied by his father's unending tales of adventure.These were stories of his father's adventures from when he was young, and they became the future that Tartaglia secretly envisioned for himself.So he would pay close attention, putting himself into the shoes of the protagonist of those tales, immersing himself fully in them even as they waited for a fish to bite.Even after leaving home, Ajax, later to be known as "Childe" Tartaglia, would keep up that hobby of his.No longer accompanied by the stories of bygone days, fishing instead became an opportunity to train - to hone his endurance, and reflect on combat techniques.Such long periods of meditation to refine his skills swiftly relegated the question of a successful catch to irrelevance.
Unlike what the rest of the world may think, Tartaglia was not born with his exceptional skills in battle.But he would never speak to anyone about that critical, fateful encounter of his...When he was 14, he fled his monotonous life at home with nothing but a shortsword and a bag of bread in hand.That 14-year-old boy got lost in the snowy forest.Pursued by bears and wolf packs, he lost his footing and fell into a bottomless crack in the earth's surface.There, he witnessed the endless possibilities of another ancient world. There, he would meet a mysterious swordswoman...Or perhaps one should say that this dark realm had sensed the burning ambition in this boy's heart.This darkness was something that the Harbinger Childe could never again delve into.In those three months, the swordswoman taught Tartaglia how to pass through the Abyss unhindered, and more importantly, nurtured the ability to stir up endless havoc from within Ajax's trouble-mongering nature.No one knew what happened within that darkness during those three months, nor would Ajax ever speak of this to anyone.When his worried mother and sisters finally found him in that forest, only 3 days had passed in this world.Thus did Ajax's first adventure end, with his now-rusty shortsword in hand.This would mark the end of his youth and the beginning of his days as a warrior.
By the time he returned home, the young man was no longer the same.He was no longer frightened and hesitant but had become frivolous and confident. He acted as if this world revolved around him, and as if battle existed for his sake.Conflict often brings about change, and this capricious, incalculable change attracted Ajax like a revolving kaleidoscope.In the eyes of his father, that third son that he had so worried about had changed for the worse, bringing much uncalled-for havoc to the seaside village of Morepesok.Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that Ajax had become a nexus of strife, for no matter where he went, fights and squabbles would follow - and he reveled in it.Ultimately, after a huge brawl was pacified with some difficulty and with some near-fatal misses, his father had no choice but to hand his beloved son over for conscription into the Fatui.He hoped that the strict military training of the Fatui could hone his son's temper, but wound up watching fully-armed troops getting the stuffing beaten out of them by a mere child.This was a great disappointment to his father, but it also caught the attention of Pulcinella, the 5th Harbinger.Shocked by Ajax's great strength and curious about how he invariably became the eye of a vortex of discord, Pulcinella inducted Ajax into the Fatui under the pretext of meting out punishment, ordering him to start from the bottom and take up the duty of serving the Tsaritsa.His insatiable desire for conquest would thus be constantly satiated in fighting for the Fatui, and his ever-burgeoning ego would gorge upon the elation of vanquishing mighty foes...Until at last, Ajax was chosen to be one of the Fatui Harbingers, donning the mantle of "Childe" Tartaglia and becoming one of the most powerful people in Snezhnaya.But becoming Tartaglia was far from his end goal. To someone who sought to conquer the world, this was but a tiny step in his journey.
"Dearest Sister, are you all keeping well at home? Has the old man's headache gotten any better?Please send my regards to our parents and our siblings.I've sent some wind chill medication over from Liyue Harbor. It's very effective, and will probably keep him from nagging for a while. It should reach you after a few days.Apart from our father's affairs, I naturally haven't forgotten about gifts for you all.This letter should come with two kites from Liyue, a rattle drum, two porcelain dolls from Inazuma, and a crate full of various snacks.And please break it to Anthon that the residents of Liyue are just boring old ordinary humans, like us.They're not made of stone, and they don't even eat stones.Do not fret for my sake, Tonia, and refrain from making trouble for anyone at home. I will be home soon. When I have seized the seven stars of Liyue and laid them at the feet of Her Majesty the Tsaritsa, I will take the first ship home, just as I promised - and you know how I always keep my promises.Yours faithfully, Your loyal knight."
Tartaglia's Delusion is his old badge of honor and the proof of his strength.He still remembers with perfect clarity the day when he received his Delusion and ascended to become a member of the Harbingers.As he stood before the cold, stern Tsaritsa, Pierro The Jester, the very first of the Fatui, personally pinned this insignia onto him.It was his reward for slaying many terrible beasts, and a memento of countless battles.But it was not this that brought Tartaglia joy, for honor is the natural reward of the warrior.Nor did he pay any mind to the odd looks his new "colleagues" gave him, for the opinions and bellyaches of others meant nothing to him.The sight of the Tsaritsa on her lofty throne alone stirred the young man's heart with respect and admiration, not merely because she opened the way for him to find an abundance of looming battles, but also because of the way she looked upon him.Her gaze was cold but pure, arrogant yet sharp.She was not only the sacrosanct Cryo Archon but also a true warrior.Thus did Childe, having received his Delusion, swear an oath of fealty to the one and only Tsaritsa of Snezhnaya.

<title>Plunging Attack</title>
<text>Plunging Attacks are performed by pressing the Normal Attack button while airborne. A standard jump on a generally flat surface does not usually give enough altitude to perform a plunging attack, so additional height is needed to achieve this.
Types of Plunging Attack DMG
Plunging Attacks can deal DMG in three different ways:
* Plunge DMG: Dealt once every 0.3s while falling mid-air in a 1m radius around the character.
* Low Plunge DMG: Dealt when the character lands after plunging from heights lower than or equal to 2.4 m.
* High Plunge DMG: Dealt when the character lands after plunging from heights greater than 2.4 m. Deals greater DMG, Poise DMG, and knockback than Low Plunge.
Plunging Height
Area of Effect
Certain characters' Elemental Skills or Elemental Bursts can give players the height needed to perform plunging attacks. Note that 'heights are approximate' and are measured in meters. Jump heights are measured from the ground to the character's feet when at max height.

<title>Elemental Infusion</title>
<text>Conversion
An Elemental Infusion changes the damage from the Normal Attack Normal, Charged Attack Charged, and Plunging Attack Plunging Attacks of a Sword, Claymore, or Polearm user into elemental damage. Different sources of Elemental Infusions may override each other.
This is not to be confused with Conversions which can also change Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attacks to elemental damage. The latter functions by replacing a character's Normal Attack moveset and therefore cannot be overridden. Conversions also typically involve more detailed visual and sound effects than infusions, and can be utilized by characters with weapon types other than the three listed above.
Overriding Infusions
Elemental Gauge Theory
When multiple infusion skills are used at once, some infusions can be overridden by others. The mechanism is complex and can be explained via Elemental Gauge Theory.
Elemental Infusions function by applying an elemental aura onto the player's weapon. This can be observed using Elemental Sight, as infused weapons are highlighted in the corresponding element's color. When multiple infusions are applied to the same weapon, the multiple elements will Elemental Reaction react and override each other through aura consumption.
Weapon auras function like Elemental Gauge Theory Advanced Mechanics Self Aura Self Auras and have the following special properties compared to regular auras:
* Their decay rates are fixed and are not determined by gauges.
* There is no Aura Tax on them.
* When weapon auras react, if the trigger element fully consumes the existing aura, the remaining trigger element will not be lost, and weapon aura will transition directly to the trigger element.
When multiple sources of infusion react, there are multiple factors that will affect which infusion overrides which:
* Infusion Frequency: Certain characters will re-apply their infusions at fixed intervals (e.g., Bennett, Chongyun, Diluc), while others only apply them once (e.g., Kamisato Ayaka, Kaedehara Kazuha, Keqing). Infusion sources with higher frequencies are more likely to take over.
* Reaction Cost: As with normal Elemental Reactions, Reactions caused by multiple weapon auras also have different aura costs depending on the reaction.
** For example, when Pyro is applied onto a Cryo aura, the Reaction Coefficient is 2, meaning every gauge of Pyro can consume 2 gauges of Cryo. However, when Cryo is applied onto a Pyro aura, the Reaction Coefficient is 0.5, meaning every gauge of Cryo will only consume 0.5 gauges of Pyro. Therefore, between Pyro and Cryo, the Pyro aura is easier to maintain than the Cryo aura. If both Pyro and Cryo infusions are applied at equal frequencies, the Pyro aura is more likely to take over due to its Reaction Cost advantage.
** A table of Reaction Coefficients can be found in Elemental Gauge Theory Most Elemental Reactions.
*** A special case of reaction not listed in the above table occurs with Kazuha's Anemo infusion. When Pyro/Cryo/Hydro is applied to an Anemo aura, the Reaction Coefficient is 2.
With the above factors combined, it can be observed that certain sources of infusions are more likely to override others:
* Bennett, Chongyun, and Candace's infusions almost always successfully override Ayaka, Dori, Kazuha, Keqing, and Lynette's infusions, due to their massive frequency advantage.
* Bennett's infusion will quickly override Chongyun's due to the Reaction Cost advantage of Pyro against Cryo.
* Diluc's infusion overrides Chongyun's with exceptional ease, as it has both a Reaction Cost advantage and a frequency advantage.
* Candace's infusion will quickly override Bennett and Diluc's due to the Reaction Cost advantage of Hydro against Pyro.
The above observations may create an illusion of "infusion priority," but it is in reality a result of standard element interaction. In addition, since elemental reactions can consume gauge units, additional infusions can cause an existing infusion's aura to finish decaying early, leaving the weapon with no infusion until the next time an infusion aura is applied. This makes it possible for a character to deal Physical DMG even while persistent infusions are active.
Coexisting Infusions
When Electro and Hydro infusions are applied to the same character, no reaction will be triggered, and both weapon auras will coexist without being consumed. However, in this scenario, the Hydro infusion will take priority when attacking. If the Hydro infusion runs out before the Electro infusion, the Electro infusion can immediately resume without needing to be reapplied.
Frozen Infusion
When Cryo and Hydro infusions are applied to the same character, the Frozen reaction will be triggered, leaving a Frozen aura on the weapon. A weapon with a Frozen aura will deal Cryo DMG.
Infusion Properties
The below table lists the Infusion Frequencies, Durations, and Gauge Units of different sources of weapon auras:

Enemies
When infused, some enemies themselves, or their weapons will be inflicted by the element in question, and are able to Elemental Reactions react with other elements, or be Elemental Absorption absorbed by certain Anemo abilites. Infused entities, whether an enemy or a weapon used by an enemy, function similarly to shields, and their elemental status can be removed after sufficient Elemental Gauge Theory gauges of the correct elements are applied, removing the infusion as a result. Such enemies include:
Notes
* Infused melee attacks cannot chop trees for wood, and cannot destroy bushes.
* The Viridescent Venerer 4-piece set uses the word "infused" to describe Anemo coming into contact with another element to trigger the Swirl reaction. However, this is different from both Elemental Infusion and Elemental Absorption.</text>

<title>Elemental Reaction</title>
<text>Elemental Reactions in Genius Invokation TCG Genius Invokation TCG/Rules Elemental Reactions
Elemental Gauge Theory
Elemental Reactions are triggered by applying certain combinations of elemental effects on a target (enemies, players, or objects).
When an element is applied to a target, it will create an elemental aura that decays over time. Elemental Reactions will occur when a second element is applied onto a target with an existing elemental aura.
Triggering elemental reactions will consume the existing aura by varying amounts depending on the type of reaction triggered and the gauge units of the triggering element. This will shorten the existing aura's duration or completely remove it.
Note that some skills have Internal Cooldown before being able to reapply their elemental effect and therefore may not be able to trigger Elemental Reactions on every hit.
Certain more complex mechanics of elemental reactions are explained in-depth in Elemental Gauge Theory, a framework for understanding interaction of elements.

<title>King Deshret</title>
<text>King Deshret, also known as Al-Ahmar,Lost in ProsperityThe Lay of Al-Ahmar AmunWhat Shape Does the Self Hold and Amon in Deshret Script, was the Lord of Deserts and one of the Three Eternal Companion-Gods who reigned in ancient Sumeru, alongside Greater Lord Rukkhadevata - the previous Dendro Archon, and Nabu Malikata - the Goddess of Flowers.Dune-Entombed Fecundity: Part IIGilded Dreams He died thousands of years before the events of the story.Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies Nahida: Forbidden knowledge once polluted the desert thousands of years ago, but was successfully repelled thanks to King Deshret's self-sacrifice and Greater Lord Rukkhadevata nearly exhausting her power.
King Deshret built his domain in the desert, full of ancient technology and mysterious powers, such as the Primal Constructs. Faruzan had also been trapped in some ruins related to him that preserved her body and mind for a century in stasis. The Eremites are descended from his subjects, and some present-day Eremites still worship him and wish to bring him back.

Profile
King Deshret was known as the "king of warriors, horticulturists, and sages." His domain was the desert and he was the master of the one thousand and one Jinn. He once ruled a kingdom in Sumeru with two other gods, Nabu Malikata and Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, and together the three were oathbound friends, known as "The Three Eternal Companion-Gods." However, when he and Nabu Malikata plotted to go against the Celestia Heavenly Principles, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata parted ways with both of them and built her own civilization in a separate corner of Sumeru.Dune-Entombed Fecundity: Part III Following Nabu Malikata's death, he was left to rule over his people alone.Olden Days of Scorching Might
Deshret was a god with strong idealism and ambition, willing to rebel against the Celestia divine despite knowing full well what repercussions it could bring. Still, the strength of his desires was what garnered the sympathy of Nabu Malikata, who determined that he could bring about the possibility of transcending the Heavenly Principles laws of this world.Flower of Paradise Lost He was also known as the Mourning King because of his deep sorrow and nostalgia for the past. It was said that he would look up at the sky and remember the "boundless paradise high above and the merciless reign of thousands of years past."Dream of Scorching Might His attachment to the past eventually caused him to go mad and brought the downfall of his people.
Symbolism
King Deshret's symbol of "the sun and the eye" entails an eye-like figure embedded in the center of a dark ten-point star described as the "sun." The eye is a light-blue diamond bordered by a thin, darker blue outline, with two lines extending from the left and right corners of the diamond. The pupil is a yellow-outlined red diamond of which an arcing section is cut from its top.
Deshret once wore a gold-inlaid headband bearing some resemblance to a nemes. Imitations of this headband were widely made by priests of the desert kingdoms which worshiped him.Shadow of the Sand King
Story
Archon War
Information on King Deshret's origins is vague. According to legend, Deshret was a "son of the sky," which was why he received fervent worship from the "three great tribes" of the desert. However, he was said not to have known about the Aria, Sonnet and Canon three moon sisters or the era of the Seelie,Staff of the Scarlet Sands LoreAmethyst Crown suggesting that he was only active after that period. He eventually met Nabu Malikata, a survivor of the Seelie, and joined forces with her to build the ancient city of Ay-Khanoum, which means "City of the Moon Maiden" in the language of the Jinn.Oasis Garden's Mourning He was in love with Nabu Malikata and she was aware of his affections,Oasis Garden's Truth although whether she reciprocated his feelings is unknown. This relationship was known to Greater Lord Rukkhadevata even before she had allied with them.Scroll of Streaming Song
By the time of the Archon War, all three gods had become allies. Deshret allowed the two others to share his throne, ruling together as the Three Eternal Companion-Gods. He even rejected a "gift" given to him by Celestia (implied to be a Gnosis, and by extension the position of Archon) to pursue his own interests and ambitions.Wilting Feast All three gods had their own views on "wisdom" and often debated their ideas with one another as friends.Deepwood Memories Each God-King had their own place: "the banquet belonged to [Nabu Malikata], authority was in the hands of [King Deshret], and life was the domain of [Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]." The era of the three God-Kings was remembered as one of peace and prosperity,Honeyed Final FeastScroll of Streaming Song and the "promised land of 'Valivija' " mentioned in 'The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin' may refer to their shared kingdom. In any event, it did not last.
Deshret's ambitions were said to be able to "shock even the wisest of gods," and he was even willing to rebel against the Heavenly Principles to fulfill them. One night, he shared all of these desires with Nabu Malikata, and remained convinced even after she warned of the repercussions Celestia would bring on him, like they had to her people. However, she eventually realized that his desires and resolve could bring about "the possibility to transcend the absurd shackles that governed this world." She finally agreed to assist him by granting him a path to finding "higher knowledge," but not without warning him of what he would lose and advising him that humanity would be the true source of hope in the rebellion against divinity.Secret-Keeper's Magic Bottle Greater Lord Rukkhadevata refused to support their plans, departing from the desert to construct her civilization in the rainforests with the Varuna Contraption. Though Nabu Malikata mourned Rukkhadevata's absence and awaited her return, they never reunited, leaving her and King Deshret to carry out their plans without the Greater Lord.
Nabu Malikata ultimately sacrificed herself in order to conduct a ritual which would guide Deshret to understanding "all there was to know about the skies and the abyss," bringing down sandstorms which laid waste to the kingdom they had created.The Tale of Shiruyeh and ShirinDreaming Steelbloom After her passing - unbeknownst to him, willingly - King Deshret mourned her deeply. Following her passing, the Jinn, followers of Nabu Malikata, became his servants; He apparently deceived them by claiming that the Goddess of Flowers was merely in a deep slumber, and that in exchange for granting him their power, he would help them find her again.The Temple Where Sand Flows Like Tears According to legends, he went to look for the Divine Nail of the sands, and upon finding it, used its power along with the aid of the Jinn to build the Eternal Oasis as a cemetery for Nabu Malikata, leaving Ferigees to watch over it.Defender of the Enchanting DreamA Moment Congealed In the aftermath, he was left to rule over the people of the desert alone.
King Deshret's civilization
King Deshret then began to pursue his dreams of a utopia, free of "worry, schemes, and slavery," based on what Nabu Malikata had taught him,Remnant Glow of Scorching MightThe result of his utopia may be the Golden Slumber and the Eternal Dreamland, which were featured in the World Quest 'Golden Slumber'. making plans to establish a vast kingdom in the desert with those virtues as the foundation.
At some point before building his kingdom, Deshret had made a deal with the ancient Dendro Dragon, Apep, who claimed dominion over the desert. Apep made a deal with Deshret to allow him to build his kingdom undisturbed, with the condition that it would consume him after his death to absorb his knowledge, in the hopes of gaining "higher knowledge" with which to use against the Heavenly Principles.The chronology of when the deal was struck is unclear. Apep is aware that Nabu Malikata was the one who helped Deshret uncover "higher knowledge," which suggests that the deal was made during or after the Archon War; however, given that Deshret was supposedly already a sovereign of the deserts before he met Nabu Malikata, it is also possible that this happened earlier. Previously, Apep and its offspring had "let the sea of sand rage like boiling water and swept houses down as if they were falling leaves," presumably causing destruction for the desert peoples, and stopped after the agreement with Deshret.The Realm of Beginnings Although Apep states it "didn't think much" of Deshret, their relationship may have been more than mere neutrality, as Apep was described as a friend of Deshret who held court in the caverns underneath the Desert of Hadramaveth.The Lost Hermitage
With Apep satisfied, Deshret went on to establish his rule over the desert. At that time, the three gods' former kingdom had supposedly splintered into numerous warring tribes. With the Jinn as his envoys and messengers to humanity,Sumeru Jinn They used to be family to the Lord of Flowers. After the death of their mistress, they were sealed into a silver vase by King Deshret for committing the crime of arrogance. But a few were pardoned and became messengers between King Deshret and the mortals. according to legend, he sought humans with hearts "untainted by the allure of corruption" to act as vassal-kings and priests who would follow his ideals and guide the people in his stead.The First Days of the City of Kings Meanwhile, Deshret also created a royal city in the desert, named Akhtamun,Candace and continued to research taboo knowledge in a bid to attain his desired paradise, becoming ever more absorbed by nostalgia and obsession.
The Jinni Liloupar found a suitable vassal for the "mortals' ideal kingdom" in the shepherd Ormazd. With her help, he went on to establish the vassal state of Gurabad, conquering and reuniting the various tribes of the desert under its banner.Memories of Gurabad It is uncertain how much of a role Deshret actually played in Gurabad, although Ormazd attributes the prosperity of his people to Deshret's guidance and built numerous temples and monuments to honor him, possibly even intending to make human sacrifices.Interactable: Nameless Tablet Nameless Tablet (V) Nameless Tablet (V) Both he and his successor Parvezravan were recorded as envoys of King Deshret.Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, Primal Obelisk The Sands of Al-Azif The Sands of Al-Azif Liloupar states that Deshret charged the "mortals' ideal kingdom" at Gurabad with the duty of protecting the Eternal Oasis, and personally created a system of canals to provide irrigation for the vassal kingdoms surrounding the Eternal Oasis, indicating that he was actively involved in the creation of their state.Dune-Entombed Fecundity: Part IInteractable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, Primal Obelisk Debris of Panjvahe Debris of Panjvahe However, other sources state that Liloupar guided the humans to settle around the oasis, and that Ferigees defied Deshret's orders when she shedded her form to make the environment around the oasis safer for the humans.Interactable: Nameless Tablet Nameless Tablet (III) Nameless Tablet (III)  Regardless, it is known that King Deshret was greatly angered when he found out that Liloupar had orchestrated the destruction of Gurabad, and had her spirit split into seven parts, given to his seven sages to be hidden throughout the land, as punishment.Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, Primal Obelisk Safhe Shatranj Safhe Shatranj
Obsession
"Meld all thoughts into one, and let all calculations be unified.""Thus shall humanity become the lord of lords and the god of gods."So went the dirge for that most lonesome king of kings,For whom the gilded sands had long divined failure.
Since the time of the Three Eternal Companion-Gods, Deshret had desired to create an eternal "dream" paradise, holding "an idea that joined the wisdom of thousands, and the great attempt at binding their dreams to power." Nabu Malikata's death only propelled him further. He sought to manage his dominion with rules "more elegant and precise" (as compared to those of the Heavenly Principles, which had devastated the Seelie with the Divine Nails) and so avoid further suffering for the survivors of Nabu Malikata's people. 'The Lay of Al-Ahmar' states that Deshret secluded himself deep within his territory to research forbidden knowledge for countless years, seeking a way to transcend his mortal form. Deshret's people proudly followed his dreams, longing for his paradise, which he said would be the "golden slumber" where there would be "neither sorrow nor parting" and none would have to drink the "bitter salt water."The Sunken YearsThe Eternal Dream, Ever Lush The results of this research included the Primal Constructs, which were built with the purpose of "rebirth[ing] the paradise that [he] dreamed of."Primal Construct: ProspectorPrimal Construct: Repulsor It also resulted in a mysterious mechanism to "gather wisdom" at Khaj-Nisut, which would allow anyone to enter the golden slumber if they recited a certain prayer and sat in Deshret's throne.Dreams Beneath the Searing SandRecord of Aaru's Shut
Gurabad's fall pushed Deshret further into his "path of self-destruction."End of the Golden Realm Within one generation of the fall of Gurabad, Deshret made the decision to create Aaru,Given their descriptions, it is possible that Aaru and the "golden slumber" at Khaj-Nisut were, or were part of, the same idea. From the Scarlet Sand Slate and Record of Aaru's Shut, it is possible that Aaru would have been an extension of the Khaj-Nisut mechanism which would somehow encompass Deshret's full territory. a culmination of his ambitions which would encompass the entire desert and "prevent such a thing [as Gurabad's fall] from happening again." In Aaru, none would have to experience "age or decay," hunger, thirst, or sadness.Scarlet Sand Slate He appointed a survivor from Gurabad, the "product of a tryst between a Nefumat fugitive and a Etta maid," to be Aaru's architect.
Deshret's motivation was not truly out of benevolence towards his people. In the end, he realized that "that which [he had] always longed to find once more [had] never been a paradise for the many," and longed for a return to the days when he, Nabu Malikata, and Greater Lord Rukkhadevata were still together. In fact, 'The Lay of Al-Ahmar' suggests that "resurrection and life eternal" was the reason why Deshret pursued his paradise, as opposed to ignoring and moving on from the past, or owning it.
The Scarlet Sand Slate and 'The Lay of Al-Ahmar' both state that King Deshret ultimately managed to separate his mind from his body, which was left in his mausoleum. This, together with the entrance to the Eternal Dreamland at Khaj-Nisut, suggest that he reached some success in his plans.'The Lay of Al-Ahmar' additionally claims that Deshret distributed his mind into the structures of his kingdom, and that he went on to connect his mind to his citizens' minds in one way or another. Given the nature of the book, this is not backed up anywhere else.
Death
In the end, all of King Deshret's dreams were left unfulfilled. In pursuing his ambitions, Deshret ended up unleashing forbidden knowledge on  the world, quickly destroying his royal city and devastating his people, and bringing the Withering into existence, with Eleazar being a manifestation of it on humans. Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, compelled by her former friendship with Deshret and their mutual bond with the deceased Nabu Malikata, came to his rescue and had priests build temples with the power of life to mitigate the disaster. Since the forbidden knowledge remained a threat, however, King Deshret chose to sacrifice his life, temporarily ending the disaster.
Per their agreement, Apep consumed Deshret's body after he died in order to gather his knowledge, but ended up being corrupted because of the nature of the forbidden knowledge acquired by Deshret. Apep believes that Deshret was aware of this and intentionally used it as a fail-safe in his plan.

<title>Abyss Order</title>
<text>The Cataclysm destruction of the nation of Khaenri'ah by the gods... is the reason why the Abyss Order now seeks to destroy the nations watched over by The Seven.|Dainsleif
The Abyss Order is a mysterious, powerful legion of monsters from the Abyss who are the enemies of both humanity and surface civilization, and thrive in many corners of Teyvat. They are one of the primary antagonistic factions in 'Genshin Impact'.
Description
The Abyss Order was founded by Chlothar Chlothar Alberich, a noble in the Alberich royal family. Some time after the cataclysm, he encountered the "Sinner" and was greatly awed by its power. He would then go on to establish the Abyss Order. In his ramblings, he addressed the Traveler's sibling as the "Prince/Princess" of the Order, somehow aware that they would eventually become its leader.Caribert
The Order's size, membership, hierarchy, and degree of power are unknown. Because most members reside in the Abyss, little is actually known about them by Teyvat, other than that they hold a strong hatred against the people of the seven nations and their Archons, and desire to overthrow the world ruled by the Archons. Many, if not all members were originally from Khaenri'ah prior to being cursed.
Members of the Abyss Order are generally perceived as any intelligent humanoid being, such as Abyss Lectors and Iniquitous Baptists. It should be noted that not all of these beings are members of the Order, such as Jakob, a neohuman who takes the form of an Iniquitous Baptist, and the Abyss Herald: Frost Fall Cryo Abyss Herald that the Traveler's sibling encountered before the Order was founded.
The Loom of Fate
The Loom of Fate is an ongoing operation that the Abyss Order is undertaking. The name was first used by Chlothar a few centuries prior to the events of the game to describe his son Caribert (NPC) Caribert; he claimed that Caribert had become the "Loom of Fate" after being imbued with Abyssal power, and would be able to weave his destiny anew.Portended Fate In current times, the term refers to attempts by the Order to construct a mechanical god.A Herald Without Adherents
Story
Around 500 years ago, the fall of the Eclipse Dynasty led to a cataclysm that destroyed Khaenri'ah.Breeze Amidst the Forest Sometime after the fall of Khaenri'ah, Chlothar and his transformed son Caribert (NPC) Caribert moved to Avidya Forest for the latter's medical treatment. He met the Traveler's Sibling Traveler's sibling, and together they discovered the "Sinner," a chained crystal hidden within the Unknown Sanctuary. The Sinner imbued Chlothar with Abyssal power, allowing him to restore Caribert's sentience. Chlothar concluded that the power of the Abyss was able to do what the Seven could not and reverse the Khaenri'ahn curse. Inspired, he began to worship the Sinner and eventually founded the Abyss Order.
Presently, the Abyss Order is led by the Traveler's sibling, who was separated from the Traveler by the Unknown God, traveled across Teyvat, and became disillusioned by the true nature of the world. All of their subordinates revere them; they are known as the Prince/Princess of the Abyss and addressed as "Your Highness."
In the beginning of the game, the Order takes advantage of Dvalin to incite him to destroy Mondstadt. However, Venti and the Traveler are able to purify the Abyssal poison in his veins and restore his sanity.A Long Shot
Soon after the aforementioned events, the Order attempted to execute their Loom of Fate operation. To this end, they planned to use the ancient technology within the "Ruin Guard Field Tillers" from Khaenri'ah, searching through the many Ruin Guards littered throughout Teyvat hoping to find the eye of the very first one. They intended to use both the Defiled Statue underneath Mt. Aocang and the eye on Osial to create a mechanized god they could control. However, the Traveler and Dainsleif found the first Field Tiller's eye at Stormterror's Lair before the Order could, and Dainsleif opted to keep it with him rather than entrust it to another party.
A group led by Enjou would later arrive in Enkanomiya to look for the book 'Before Sun and Moon', which would serve as proof that Celestia came from beyond Teyvat, though this would end in failure and a large amount of casualties as the Traveler investigated Enkanomiya. Later on, Enjou would negotiate with the Bathysmal Vishap to engulf Enkanomiya in darkness so they could rescue their kin inside the Dainichi Mikoshi. This appeared to serve no useful meaning, since Enjou had no real reason to help the vishaps.Three Realms Gateway Offering: Aftermath
The Abyss Order became aware of an unusual pool of water in The Chasm: Underground Mines the Chasm that would subdue the effects of the curse placed upon them. The Traveler's sibling, determined to reverse the curse, authorized an experimental device that would supposedly amplify the water's effects - this was despite its low chance of success and the high chance of causing undue suffering to the hilichurls. The operation was foiled by both Dainsleif and the Traveler, the former having been accidentally been sent to the Chasm and the latter investigating unusual hilichurl activity.In the Depths, an Unexpected Reunion
Sometime after the events of the Sumeru Archon Quests, the Abyss Order began to meddle with the Ley Lines around Avidya Forest for reasons unknown. Dainsleif managed to put a stop to it, though the Ley Line disruption allowed the Traveler to relive their sibling's time with Chlothar in the same location centuries ago.
Notes
* Background stories that may be related to the Abyss Order are told in some artifact set and weapon lores - notably that of Arundolyn, Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius, who led an expedition against the monsters that spewed forth from Khaenri'ah. While he survived, his friend and companion Rostam perished in battle.Brave HeartFerrous Shadow Description
** Rostam was mentor to a person known as the White Knight, later known as the Bloodstained Knight. After his violent path caused others to shun him, he continued his battle against the monsters in Khaenri'ah and ultimately perished. After death, however, he learned about the injustice behind Khaenri'ah's destruction, that caused the people of the land to be cursed and become monsters.Bloodstained ChivalryThe Black Sword Lore</text>

<title>Kaeya/Lore</title>
<text>In the Knights of Favonius, Kaeya is the most trusted aide for the Acting Grand Master Jean. You can always count on him to solve any intractable problems. Everyone in Mondstadt loves Kaeya, but no one knows what secrets this witty, charming knight has...
Personality
An accomplished swordsman and a strategic thinker in the Knights of Favonius, rumored to hail from beyond Mondstadt.
Kaeya is an outwardly confident and charming individual with a flair for drama. He is sometimes seen as overly laid-back and even lazy, but he takes his work seriously. He is surprisingly popular among the elderly of Mondstadt, even earning himself the title of "top candidate for grandson-in-law." His charisma and determination have earned him the admiration, respect, and favor of many people in Mondstadt - yet, his love for provoking others has also gained him the exasperation of those same people. Kaeya also enjoys putting people into high-stress situations and challenging their values, which he does to both his enemies and his allies alike. He takes pleasure in seeing the hesitation in his comrades' eyes at the moment just before they dive into battle with him, just as he takes pleasure in the look of fear in his enemies' eyes as they face off against him.
He seems to get a kick out of telling bold-faced lies and convincing others to do his work, but this serves him well in his role in the Knights of Favonius. He is a self-proclaimed "anti-hero with an attitude problem;" as long as everything ends the way he wants, Kaeya does not care about the methods used. Still, according to his informant Vile, he draws the line at working with those who threaten other people's families, believing they deserve to be "hunted down and destroyed."
Despite his extroversion, the Traveler has observed that he appears to struggle with loneliness, though he playfully deflects when confronted about it. He frequently reminds the Traveler that they can talk to him, invites them to spend time with him, insistently offers (sometimes extensive) assistance, and often voices his disappointment whenever the Traveler has to leave, showing his desire to be helpful and aversion to being alone.
Appearance
Icy Featherflight
Kaeya uses the Tall Male Characters tall male model. He has a tanned complexion and navy-blue hair with streaks of lighter blue, accompanied by a waist-length lock of hair that begins at the base of his scalp on the back of his head at the left. His visible eye is periwinkle with a diamond-shaped pupil that is shared with other characters known to be from Khaenri'ah. Over his right eye, he wears a gold-trimmed black eyepatch that is mostly covered by his bangs. Kaeya has not been seen without his eyepatch, but his right eye, which is functional, is implied to have a scar over it due to being wounded by Diluc during their battle after Crepus' death.Event Hidden Strife Interactable: Hidden Strife Story Letters in Dawn Winery A Letter in Beautiful Handwriting (V)
Notably, while other Mondstadt characters' Vision casings feature three feathers per wing, Kaeya's Vision only features two feathers. He is also the only one with a wing on the right side of the back of his Vision (other Mondstadt Visions have them on the left side or no wings at all on the back). Kaeya is one of only a few characters across all nations who has a Vision with nonstandard casing (both Furina's Vision and Venti's fake "Vision" both have unique casings as well).
Character Stories
Kaeya Alberich is an adopted son to the Ragnvindr Family, the renowned wine tycoon.It has been a long time since he last called Diluc Diluc Ragnvindr "brother."Kaeya currently serves as the Cavalry Captain of the Knights of Favonius, and is trusted by Jean.Kaeya is often the one wrapping things up in every incident that occurs in Mondstadt's vicinity.
It is a curious fact that your best chance of finding Kaeya is not by visiting the Knights of Favonius Headquarters Knights' headquarters, but by frequenting the taverns at night.Kaeya is often found sitting at the bar, gossiping with the city folk, and sipping the famed Mondstadt beverage, Death After Noon.He is surprisingly popular among the elderly of Mondstadt, even earning himself the title of "top candidate for grandson-in-law."It's hard to imagine someone as mischievous, amiable, and wine-loving as Kaeya being the Cavalry Captain of the Knights of Favonius.Hunters and bandits alike are often among Kaeya's drinking buddies. As wary of him as they may initially be, all are ultimately disarmed by his smooth talking, and end up telling him everything he wants to know.Depending on what they then make privy to Kaeya, their night may turn into an uncontrollable nightmare or remain one of harmless banter."Everyone's got a secret, but not everyone knows what to do with it."Says Kaeya, with his usual arrogant smirk.
"Justice is not an absolute principle, but is the result of striking that fine balance between strength and strategy. As for the details of how it's done... Don't worry yourself too much about that."Kaeya once said these words in front of Grand Master Varka.As long as everything falls into place the way he expects in the end, Kaeya doesn't care all that much about how it's done.This cavalier attitude is what defines his character.Not that different from Death After Noon's wild and explosive taste, one might add.However, his reckless approach to things is not uncontroversial.Once, in order to force a bandit leader into facing him directly, Kaeya triggered the Ruin Guard at an ancient ruin to cut his opponent off, putting his own men at risk in the process.It's times like these when even Jean, who puts a lot of trust in Kaeya, finds herself shaking her head in disapproval.Not that this bothers Kaeya, of course. On the contrary, he actually enjoys putting people into the difficult position of making tough decisions.He takes pleasure in seeing the hesitation in his comrades' eyes in the moment just before they dive into battle with him, just as he takes pleasure in the look of fear in his enemies' eyes as they face off against him.
The flourishing winery business in Mondstadt has been a great source of prosperity in the region over the years. This prosperity often entices greedy bandits and monsters to the area.They are a motley bunch who hide in the shadows, and their backgrounds, motives, and allegiances are varied and complex.Kaeya battles against this threat to Mondstadt not only with his sword, but also with his smarts and his wit.A young knight once dedicated years of his life to studying threats in and around Mondstadt, and reached an astounding conclusion:When Death After Noon is out of season due to lack of supply, the number of reported incidents inside and outside the city show a drastic decrease, and this remains the case until Death After Noon returns to the market...The young knight showed his findings to Cavalry Captain Kaeya in hopes of getting some advice from him."Interesting. I'll look into it." Kaeya answered, with a wry smirk on his face.
Generally speaking, Kaeya is an easy person to have a conversation with. The only topic that you will never hear him discuss is his past.Even when the Grand Master demanded information on his background, Kaeya skirted around the issue and gave only vague answers devoid of details."One afternoon near the end of summer a decade ago, my father and I passed by the Dawn Winery.""'I'll go get us some grape juice for the road,' he said, but he never came back.""If Master Crepus hadn't taken me in, I doubt I'd have made it through the storm that night."This matter-of-fact description hides a carefully constructed lie.Kaeya has never once spoken the truth about what happened that afternoon:"This is your chance. You are our last hope."Kaeya's father squeezed his son's lean shoulders as he spoke, seemingly looking right through Kaeya to some place far beyond.On the other side of the horizon sat their distant homeland of Khaenri'ah.Kaeya would never forget the look of both hope and hatred in his father's eyes as he uttered those words.
Many citizens still remember the two most eye-catching young gentlemen in all of Mondstadt a few years ago.One of them was the dapper Diluc, an elegant swordsman who always had a warm smile and a confident posture.The other was the eccentric Kaeya. He was Diluc's friend, supporter, and sounding board, ensuring he got through every challenge he faced smoothly.They were almost like twins, knowing each other's thoughts and intentions without a word, protecting Mondstadt in both light and dark....Until that fateful day, now ingrained deep in Kaeya's memory, when the convoy that Diluc was escorting was attacked by a Ursa the Drake huge monster.It was the first and only time that Kaeya failed in his duty.By the time Kaeya finally reached Diluc, it was all over.The Delusion power their father had used to successfully fend off the attack backfired, taking their father's life.Both Kaeya and Diluc were shocked by what they had witnessed, losing the calm composure a knight should retain."Even someone like Master Crepus would submit to such a dangerous and evil power..."Sinister thoughts flashed through Kaeya's mind, and he simply smirked:"This world is truly... fascinating."All while their father lay dead in a pool of his own blood. It was on that night that the two sons' paths diverged.
Between the pages of "The Adventures of Angelos," you find a list of names written on a sheet of official Knights of Favonius letterhead paper.It meticulously records the details of bandits in the city and further afield, as well as mercenaries and mid-to-senior-level Treasure Hoarder members, listing for each entry a name, position, area of activity, and personal profile.A dozen or so names are circled, with a note in the margin saying "Otherwise, things would get too boring."When questioned about it, Kaeya's response is "I suppose I must have gotten drunk and started scribbling nonsense."Your gut feeling is that Kaeya purposely let you see this list, but you have no way of proving it.
It was raining heavily in Mondstadt on the night that Kaeya Alberich received his Vision.Earlier that day, Crepus Ragnvindr had wielded the power of a Delusion - only to become its victim when it backfired. To set his father free from the unbearable agony, Diluc Ragnvindr took his life.Kaeya was Diluc's brother by adoption and was always by his side, but on this occasion Kaeya did not partake in the final moments shared between father and son.The torrential rain that set in on Mondstadt that night seemed to be a sign of the heavens' grief at the passing of Master Crepus.There was a side to Kaeya that he kept hidden from the world: In truth, he was an agent of Khaenri'ah, placed in Mondstadt to serve their interests. His father had abandoned him in this strange and unknown land to fulfill this mission, and it was Master Crepus and the city of Mondstadt that had welcomed him with open arms when they found him.If Khaenri'ah and Mondstadt went to war, which side should he support? To whom should he offer his assistance: his birth father, who had ruthlessly abandoned him? Or his adoptive father, who had loved him and raised him?For the longest time, Kaeya had agonized over these impossible questions, caught between the opposing demands of loyalty and duty, faced with an impossible choice between truth and happiness.But now, Crepus' death upset this delicate balance. He felt liberated, but also ashamed of how selfishly he was responding. As an adopted son, he should have saved Crepus, but he had arrived moments too late. As a brother, he should have shared in Diluc's grief, and yet as their father lay dying on the ground, he had hung back behind his brother, that ancient plot running through his mind.Consumed by guilt, Kaeya knocked on Diluc's door. As the rain poured down, the shroud of secrecy was washed away and all lies were revealed. Kaeya had finally come clean.He had anticipated Diluc's anger. The brothers drew their blades, this time pointing them at each other. Kaeya felt that this was his punishment for a lifetime of lies.But as the two crossed blades, Kaeya was overcome by the sensation of great elemental power surging through him. For years, he had stayed out of the way in his brother's shadow. But now, for the first time ever, he was facing his brother as his true self.Bitterly cold and brittle elemental energy burst forth from the tip of his sword to meet Diluc’s searing flames head-on. The clash of crimson fire and azure ice created a sudden swirl of wind that stunned them both. This was the grim moment at which Kaeya's Vision appeared.Since that day, Kaeya and Diluc have gone their separate ways. But he never discusses it, just as he never discusses the origin of his Vision.Though it is a reminder of a hard-fought battle, and the prize that he earned in exchange for revealing the unadulterated truth, Kaeya sees it as a stern reminder that he must live the rest of his life under the heavy burden of lies.

<title>Tatarigami</title>
<text>Orobashi's divine form was sundered along with the mountains, its ichor turned into plasma, and its will and power became a curse that could never be extinguished: Tatarigami.
The Tatarigami ja=祟り神 ja_rm=Tatarigami ja_tl=Curse God is a curse that plagued Yashiori Island, Inazuma, formed from the will and power of the serpent god Orobashi who was slain over the island. When the wards suppressing it are disrupted, it causes sickness and calamities around the island.
Before the Traveler's arrival, the wards over Yashiori Island were destroyed, causing a resurgence of Tatarigami and a stalemate between the Shogun's Army and the Watatsumi Army. The Tatarigami manifest as a black aura around certain enemies in the island, and as a persistent storm overshadowing the island when players first explore the area.
Overview
The Tatarigami spawned from Orobashi's will and power after Raiden Ei slew it on Yashiori Island towards the end of the Archon War.Golden Branch of a Distant Sea
Areas affected by the Tatarigami experience perpetual thunderstorms, and plants grown in contaminated soil will wither away.Treatment on the IslandHanayama Kaoru's Flowery Plan
Exposure to Tatarigami typically causes mysterious, untreatable illnesses in humans, although the effects are mitigated for Vision-bearers or those with another form of elemental sensitivity. Physical effects include random unstoppable bleeding from orifices, fevers, constant migraines, rashes, as well as dizziness and weakness.Tatarigami Investigation ExpeditionPharmacist's Notebook (II) Psychological effects include auditory hallucinations and insanity; notably, people's auditory hallucinations primarily revolving around an unknown god addressed as "Him."Tattered Paper (Washizu) While raving about how Chouji's Mother Chouji's mother will not escape "Him," Washizu describes this god as having "eighteen pairs of blood-red eyes! Thousands of sharp, venomous fangs! Countless mouths and numberless tongues, ever thirsting after blood!"Washizu's Prayers In the Tatarigami Investigation Expedition Fort Mumei Lost Text at Fort Mumei, the author writes down his hallucinatory experiences, in which he describes witnessing "three teeth" which had "something black ooz[ing] out of them" as well as seeking some kind of treasure, before finally "melting into 'his' whisperings."
Some people show particular resistance to the Tatarigami's corruption, although the phenomenon is not understood. While Chouji's mother fell ill, she remained in clear conscience and was relatively healthy compared to others affected, which Yasumoto suspects was caused by the Tatarigami's energy "flowing freely inside of her" instead of corrupting her. Among the residents of Higi Village who remained, neither Chouji nor Yasumoto display symptoms of being corrupted by the Tatarigami.
Objects have also been observed to be susceptible to the Tatarigami. Akame Kanenaga used the power of the Tatarigami to infuse his consciousness into Kagotsurube Isshin, a blade he made while in exile in Snezhnaya. He told the sword his wish to show Inazuma that the Isshin Art is still worthy of the Raiden Shogun's trust. However, the intrinsic hatred in the Tatarigami corrupted the sword, warping its goal into rivaling the gods at any cost, to the point where it possessed many humans until they were of no use in its journey back to Inazuma.Ere the End, a Glance Back
History
Suppression and Exploitation
After the rise of Tatarigami, The Raiden Shogun placed wards called Narukami Pillar to suppress Orobashi's soul, hence subduing the Tatarigami.Teyvat Travel Guide The Yashiori Guardians, led by Kitain Bunsou and the Kitain Clan, also took up the mantle of suppressing the Tatarigami.Orobashi's Legacy: Part VKitain Cross Spear
With the threat of the Tatarigami minimized, people from Narukami Island began mining Crystal Marrow from Orobashi's remains. The people of Watatsumi Island, who continued to worship Orobashi, were greatly incensed by the exploitation of their god's remains.Clean HouseA Preliminary Study of Sangonomiya Folk Belief
In recent years, the Mikage Furnace was built at Tatarasuna at the behest of the Tenryou Commission, using technology from Fontaine capable of harnessing the Tatarigami's energy to smelt Jade Steel. This decision has been hotly contested by the priestesses of the Grand Narukami Shrine, who believe that the Tatarigami are too dangerous to be trifled with.Tatara Tales (Quest)
Present Day
Acting on orders from the Eleven Fatui Harbingers First Harbinger to stall the war, Fatui mole Nathan spurred Orobashi fanatics within the Watatsumi Army into damaging the wards on Yashiori IslandInteractable: Narukami Pillar Waterlogged Note Waterlogged Note while Sangonomiya Kokomi was away to negotiate with mercenaries.Kaida Ryouma This led to a resurgence of the Tatarigami across the island and with it, mysterious ailments and poor weather which ground the conflict between the Shogun's Army and Watatsumi Army into a bitter stalemate.
The Kitain bloodline had died out by this time, while Tenryou Commission head Kujou Takayuki refused to believe Kujou Masahito's reports about the severity of the Tatarigami situation; the Mikage Furnace's core, which had been damaged and was on the verge of a meltdown, could not be attended to by the Grand Narukami Shrine due to Hanbei's inaction and hostility from the Tenryou Commission soldiers stationed there. As a result, all Inazuman forces who could change the Tatarigami situation were preoccupied or unable to attend to the matter before the Traveler's arrival.
Over the course of the Orobashi's Legacy, the Traveler helps Kaji, a resident of the island, repair the Narukami Pillars. With each pillar repaired, its corresponding region is slowly cleared of the Tatarigami's influence. In the Tatara Tales, the Traveler also assists Xavier, one of the personnel in charge of creating and maintaining the Mikage Furnace, in repairing the furnace's core and fending off the Fatui forces attempting to use it for their own ends.
Despite the Traveler's aid, the ravages of the Tatarigami's influence can be felt throughout the island. Higi Village has been all but abandoned, with most of its inhabitants having either fled to either neighboring island for refuge, or died from illness or insanity. By the time the Traveler stumbles on the village, it has been reduced to a total of two residents, Yasumoto and Chouji, while the village chief, Washizu, had fallen to insanity.

<title>Viaghara</title>
<text>Viaghara was a "true tiger" and the first lord of the forest, born after Greater Lord Rukkhadevata established her domain in Dharma Forest and created the Varuna Contraption.Laurel Coronet
Profile
Little is known about Viaghara beyond the stories regarding its creation. According to legends, after Greater Lord Rukkhadevata chose to split from King Deshret and the Great Red Sand, she moved eastwards and created the Varuna Contraption to nurture a rainforest, later called Dharma Forest. The Varuna Contraption's creation caused the moon's reflection on the water to create the image of a labyrinth. This labyrinth gave birth to a divine beastRishboland Tiger in the form of a tiger, which was named Viaghara.The Coordinates of Sun and Rain
Appearance
Viaghara's stripes resembled "blazing flames" and were constantly changing.
Story
When Viaghara was born, Rukkhadevata gave him a certain crown, and the two exchanged tokens to represent their friendship, described as "gems that glimmered like water and silver that gleamed like the moonlight." After the Aranara - or the "children of the pomegranate" - were created, Viaghara blessed them under the first Vasara Tree and made a pact with Rukkhadevata to share the labyrinth with them. From then on, the two groups worked together to protect the Varuna Contraption and the "secret of sun and rain": the lords of the forest used hedges and streams, while the Aranara used dreams and illusions.
The crown Rukkhadevata had given him was passed down to a girl named Cinnamon, Viaghara's squire,King's Squire who was the first maiden to follow in the lords of the forests' footsteps.Labyrinth Wayfarer Cinnamon went on to teach other children of the forest how to navigate the labyrinth and follow the rules of nature, who themselves went on to teach more successors and established what would be known as the guardians of the forest. Viridescent, who lived during the cataclysm 500 years ago, came from that lineage, but abandoned that path in order to enact revenge on Abyssal monsters.Scholar of Vines
Nothing else can be determined about Viaghara's life beyond its death at an unknown point in the past, with each successor after it changing their palace's form based on their images and visions.Forest Regalia It had an unknown number of successors, which ultimately ended with a tiger only referred to as the "final lord of the forest," which died defending the forest during the cataclysm. From then on, the Rishboland Tigers have succeeded the "tiger" name.
Faramarz and the Huntress
An unknown amount of time after King Deshret sacrificed himself to end the forbidden knowledge pollution he had brought to his kingdom, which led it to ruin, a fallen desert prince named Faramarz eventually attempted to try his luck in the forest. However, sensing that Faramarz had blood on his hands and wishing to prevent him from trying to conquer the forest, the lord of the forest at the time ordered a huntress wielding a white bow - now known as Hunter's Path - to drive him away over and over again.Lamp of the LostWandering Evenstar However, the huntress refused to take his life in hopes that he could one day redeem himself. Though the king did not see that potential in Faramarz, he ordered the huntress to guide the desert-dweller into the maze to pick off a white branch. Faramarz's ultimate fate is unclear,Light of Foliar Incision with accounts suggesting he died in the forest.
It is unknown whether the lord of the forest and the huntress involved in this story were Viaghara and Cinnamon; due to a lack of names for the other lords of the forest, it is currently assumed that the "ancient forest king" refers to Viaghara.</text>

Character Stories
Yoimiya's name is renowned throughout Hanamizaka.She is the most skilled pyrotechnician in Inazuma and is known as the "Queen of the Summer Festival."Yoimiya, who has inherited the mantle of "Naganohara", is able to give people an unparalleled experience with her ever-changing and spectacular fireworks.In addition to being a craftsperson, she is also the "heroic sister" in the eyes of many children. No matter how big the problem is, Yoimiya always has a solution to save the day.Be it the illusions of fear or the shadows of cold reality, they will all dissipate under the starlight magic of Yoimiya's fireworks.The children are not the only ones she helps - as long as one is willing to talk to her about their troubles, she will lend a helping hand, and try her best to help them through the crisis.Splendid fireworks, warm starlight and passionate lights all join in a swirling dance in Yoimiya's hands. Her bright smile is always able to inspire fellow travelers and light up the way for them.
To Inazumans, fireworks symbolize summer.The various festivals that take place at fixed times feature a rotation of various events, with fireworks being the sole constant.Over a century ago, the Yashiro Commission once organized a dazzling fireworks display with "commemoration" as the theme.The fireworks then were made by the greatest pyrotechnicians in the land, and this was the origin of the Naganohara Fireworks Show.In latter days, fireworks would become more common, and the Naganohara Fireworks Show would slowly become an event in which all people would participate.During the Fireworks Show, everyone can light their favorite fireworks, and the owner of the Naganohara Fireworks store will pick an appropriate time to set up a most lavish performance.The year Yoimiya took over, her first fiesta was already jaw-droppingly good.On the night before that Fireworks Show, Kamisato Ayaka enjoined Yoimiya thusly: "Raiden Shogun Her Excellency will be watching this fireworks display personally. As such, please add Her Excellency's emblem - the Electro Mitsudomoe - into the fireworks repertoire, if you would.""Haha, just wait for it!" Yoimiya replied, agreeing with great confidence.Before the show could begin, Yoimiya ran all about the city, placing thousands of launch tubes in every nook and cranny. At the festival's finale, the blazing fireworks formed a gigantic picture scroll that depicted the city of Inazuma in the skies.Yet Ayaka did not find the critical emblem in any one of these fireworks, and wondered if Yoimiya had made an error in her arrangements.It was only after speaking with Yoimiya that Ayaka discovered that the image of Inazuma in the skies had an "angling" trick added to it.If viewed from the Tenshukaku, the fireworks would form a huge, clear, and orderly image of the Raiden Shogun's house-crest - with some playfully lacy decorations on the side to boot.Of course, how could Yoimiya miss a beat at a fireworks performance? This way, she won the praise of both the people and the Raiden Shogun, and this feast would become a timeless classic deeply rooted in the memories of countless people.With Yoimiya around, the Inazuman summer shall not lack any glorious fireworks - thus was her nickname, "Queen of the Summer Festival," coined.
Naganohara's fireworks are loved by all, and work in the shop is always in full swing. As such, people often feel that coming up to the door without important matters might hinder the work.However, it's just the opposite with Yoimiya, for chatting is her other great hobby. In fact, if there's no one to talk to, she might actually find it hard to focus.If chatting with the guest is her way of "understanding their mood and way of thinking, such that the best fireworks can be crafted," then going with the flow and sitting down for tea and an idle chat with them after delivering the goods is how Yoimiya rewards herself. Sometimes, if that is not enough, she will make some small-talk with her neighbors on the way, give them some small trinkets, and receive a basket of small treats in return...Yoimiya is always able to strike a balance between listening and speaking in such chats.She doesn't repeat herself, doesn't cross boundaries, doesn't come off as indifferent or overly invested. After a talk over tea, everyone leaves in a good mood.Her neighbors are all ordinary folk, and their lives are not exactly full of extraordinary things. Sometimes, the same news will be told by different people over and over, but Yoimiya does not find this upsetting.What she enjoys is the process of talking to others - even if they speak of the same matter, different people will have different viewpoints.After taking over the fireworks shop, Yoimiya's relationships with her neighbors became still more harmonious. Many old folks have taken her for an old acquaintance, and often invite her to their place to sit and recount the festivals of yesteryear. Middle-aged parents will ask Yoimiya to mediate the relationship between themselves and their children and will regale her with the little trivialities of daily family life. The young people treat Yoimiya as a sibling of sorts, volunteering to help her cart heavy fireworks-making materials around, hoping that Yoimiya will get off work faster and take the children out to play.Yoimiya puts it this way: "I believe in the unique power of language. There's nothing that can't be talked through somehow!"
Craftsmen seeking perfection are often rigorous and self-disciplined, but Yoimiya is an exception, acting freely and taking unscheduled breaks.Sometimes, she even has to work late into the night when she misses her daytime work due to chatting for too long. But when the sun begins to rise, she will climb up to the heights to see the sunrise with a sense of accomplishment at having finished her work in her heart. Looking out at the hazy amber-gold clouds, Yoimiya often gains new inspiration, imagining all manners of new fireworks in her mind, even as sleep draws near...Her neighbors have often found her sleeping in places like eaves, tree branches, and stopped waterwheels. Sometimes, she even falls down, before blearily watching her sweet dreams and golden stars fade away into the distance.Fortunately, she has never been seriously injured in such incidents, but she has gotten a number of scrapes and cuts, and it was on that account that she learned how to deal with wounds.At some other times, Yoimiya will sleep until midnight, settling all matters with gusto before heading out for a stroll.Perhaps it may turn out to be an impromptu adventure, or perhaps a test of courage. If a friend is interested, she might call upon them. If she wishes to be alone, she will travel in solitude.Living as she pleases gives Yoimiya a sense of freedom. As for others, they may encounter her at any time at all. She enjoys this freedom, often saying that it has made her life very interesting indeed.Of course, she will restrain herself on the eve of celebrations. Mistakes shall not be made during these all-important performances - her "official business."
Apart from selling fireworks, Naganohara Fireworks also sells various intricate knickknacks. This can be said to be Yoimiya's second career.All manner of trinkets adorn the shelves, with some of them being exotic imports from Beidou that were modified and made into highly distinctive handicrafts, and others being practice works created during bursts of Yoimiya's explosive inspiration.From the Scatterbloom Marbles that will blossom when they knock against each other, Leaping Tops that chirp like birds as they spin, the Neon Dragonfly that changes hue as it ascends into the air, and the somewhat-failed Onikabuto Chariot... All these toys are inspired by the little games that the common people play.They are not only popular among the children, but are much-loved by adults as well. Even Arataki Itto, the head of the Arataki Gang, comes over to buy her specially-made knickknacks, which he then brings to go challenge the one he has declared Kujou Sara his nemesis.Yoimiya's knickknacks are not just toys. With some thought, they can be very useful in one's daily life. The most classic example of this is the Katydid Coil, which is a ring that can contain a variety of flammables and spices. When ignited and hung up in the summer, it can be used to repel mosquitoes.Many people have come to ask Yoimiya for help on account of her excellent craftsmanship. And though she protests, saying, "Hey now, this is a fireworks shop, not an everything shop. Even I can't possibly do it all," she will still try her best to help, even if her earnings for the whole day are only enough to buy a few snacks. She'll enjoy the whole thing, too - everyone in Hanamizaka is her friend, after all.
"The rainbows become fireworks, and they my wishes know, my wishes rise into the skies, and through the night they show."This nameless folksong has been around for a long time now. In recent years, it was misconstrued by the children to mean that as long as they brought some shiny trinkets, they could exchange them with Yoimiya for fireworks that belong just to them, and that if they lit those fireworks up, their wish will come true at some point in the future.As such, the children of Hanamizaka set about searching for beautiful little trinkets with this song on their lips, before bringing them to Yoimiya, with expectation eagarly written on their faces.Yoimiya was quite troubled by this at first, but after hearing how the children had interpreted that song, she accepted their requests gladly and even added her own spin to the tale: the "rainbows" in the song not only refer to shiny treasures persay. As long as she found them "sufficiently shiny," whether they were colored rocks from the creeks or shell fragments from the beaches, she would take them and make lovely fireworks as per the agreement.Indeed, if they were to bring her expensive things, she might, in turn, say that they are too ordinary, and take the child to look for the owner of those lost goods.But it really did not matter if the treasures were shiny or not. The important part was the conviction the children had that "rainbows" could indeed be exchanged for "fireworks."Though some might take it for naivete, Yoimiya will give her all to protect the lovely wishes that only children can have."The things we believed in and experienced as children become irreplaceable treasures."The legendary picture books of Inazuma are often filled with the following images: the cute and playful Great Mujina Youkai, the majestic Shiba Warrior, the Origami Nue who appears out of nowhere...Perhaps those who drew demons in such cute forms also had a similar intention to Yoimiya.The children gather around Yoimiya, enjoying a gladsome time even amidst Inazuma's lockdown.Yoimiya's own child-like heart and liveliness never dulls, like fireworks and stars that shimmer and shine in the night sky.
Every festival, Yoimiya not only tries snacks from every store, but she also collects all sorts of candies, wraps them up with care, before storing them away inside a small candy box.Yoimiya's candy box is a small crimson ball that has been decorated with delicate lanyards and ornate accessories, much like the hair accessories she often wears.Each time she encounters a joyous event, she will take one candy out of the box and eat it. If her friends or the children are around, she will share the sweets with them.Yoimiya's neighbors often mistake her hair ornaments for the candy box, hence its erroneous nickname "Sweet Pearl."The speed at which the box lightens is taken for an important measure of happiness.The quicker it empties, the more pleased Yoimiya is.Sometimes, when things get busy, she sometimes absently uses the candy box as a hair accessory, realizing her mistake only after the day is done.Still, even this error would inspire Yoimiya. From then on, she would wear them interchangeably."Take a guess: does my hair ornament have candy in it today? Free pick of the sweets to anyone who gets it right!"
Yoimiya is always up for a chat. It is only when the fireworks are ascending into the skies that she quiets down and just watches the lovely scenery.People often say that fireworks come and go in a fleeting heartbeat, but if they are memorable enough, they will remain in bloom forever in people's hearts.Those who accompanied you and the loveliness of the moment itself, will burrow deep into your mind as a beautiful memory.And as you look upon the same fireworks, many years later, that same memory and the feelings that came with it will surely rise again to the forefront of your heart.Is this not also "Eternity"?The special firework formula slips that belong solely to the Naganohara family exist for precisely this purpose.By incorporating goodwill and wishes into the gorgeous fireworks, ephemeral things are etched into eternity. This is the meaning of Yoimiya's line of work.On one summer night following her taking over Naganohara Fireworks, Yoimiya could not sleep, and thus she continued in her research till daylight came.Suddenly, she heard a tinkling sound, and a burning-red object fell into an unused launching tube.At first, Yoimiya used her Vision as a sort of lighter. Fortunately, her Naganohara Ryuunosuke father discovered it and explained a Vision's significance to her.So, this tiny gem could grant a person astonishing and mysterious powers. And yet what else could it do other than protect the children or chase some mischievous monsters away?"Even if it could have other uses," Yoimiya thought, "it may not ever need to do these things in my hands. I'm just someone who pursues happiness, a fireworks-maker who enjoys living life."Time has flown since then, and Yoimiya has grown ever more skilled in the manipulation of "fire," with her skill at making fireworks having likewise increased.Sometimes, she stops to ask herself this: "How did someone as ordinary as me receive the acknowledgment of the gods? Do the gods... enjoy fireworks, by any chance?"

<title>Gunnhildr Clan</title>
<text>For Mondstadt, as always.
The Gunnhildr Clan, also known as House Gunnhildr,YouTube:  is one of the prominent families in Mondstadt, alongside the Ragnvindr Clan, the Imunlaukr Clan and formerly, the Lawrence Clan.
History
During Decarabian's Rule
The Gunnhildr Clan was formed long before its namesake, Gunnhildr. However, little is known about their history prior to her rise as clan leader; all that is known is that they took refuge from Andrius' blizzards inside Decarabian's city, but left after growing disillusioned with the archon's rule.Biography of Gunnhildr
The Gunnhildr clan had difficulty surviving in the blizzards outside the city, and they cried out for help, which a wind spirit heard. Gaining power from the clan's faith, the wind spirit was able to give them a small shelter. When her father died, Gunnhildr took the role as leader of the clan and became the first priestess, protecting the clan with the power bestowed on her by the wind spirit. When Barbatos challenged Decarabian, Gunnhildr led her clan to fight alongside, and when he succeeded she decorated the new Anemo Archon with laurels.
Early Aristocratic Period
Mondstadt Aristocracy
The oath that the ancient Mondstadt inhabitants took when Barbatos reformed the land and founded new Mondstadt features the Gunnhildr clan's saying, and was either created by Gunnhildr or at the very least that clan remembered the oath better than the other clans. Swordsmanship becoming mandatory for nobles likely originated from the Gunnhildr clan's culture of always being ready to protect Mondstadt.Royal Longsword
During the time that the people of Mondstadt worshipped the gods of Anemo and Time together, the Gunnhildr clan would enact the defense of Mondstadt with prop weapons.Sacrificial Sword
Late Aristocratic Period
The Gunnhildr clan remained a prominent clan throughout the Aristocracy, but they stayed true to their oath to protect Mondstadt and did what they could to help the people. During Vennessa's rebellion the Gunnhildr clan sided with the people and were spared from exile unlike the rest of the Aristocracy.
Present
The Gunnhildr clan continues to keep their oath to protect Mondstadt, with many knights and clergy members coming from that clan.

<text>the NPC named "Masanori" the deceased character Masanori
"Masanori" ja=「公義」 ja_rm="Masanori", previously known as Nameless, is an NPC that can be found in Tatarasuna, Inazuma.
After completing Dreams of Sword Art, "Masanori" can be fought again any time. His movesets are similar to those of a Kairagi: Dancing Thunder. However, unlike regular Kairagi, Masanori periodically heals himself and also restores his health to full after his first health bar is depleted.
Profile
Nameless is a samurai that trained in the art of the sword at a young age with his friend Masanori. Despite both of them being ridiculed, they became proficient fighters in the Tenryou Commission and was promoted to Hatamoto, until a battle at Nazuchi Beach, in which Masanori died. His death drew him insane and he deserted the Shogun's Army. Becoming a Kairagi: Dancing Thunder Kairagi, Nameless won every duel until he met the Traveler. Wondering what he was missing, he believed no one could help him and attacked the Traveler, but to his surprise, he lost the duel. He then realized that they could help him regain his memories, so he sent them off to collect items from places he could vaguely remember, before dueling them again to recover more.
After bringing back wine from Matsudaira, Nameless believed he was originally called "Masanori." After yet another duel, he told them to find his friend's blade from Nazuchi Beach. When they returned with his blade, he went berserk and attacked them on the spot, but the Traveler was able to best him once more. He calmed down and thanked the Traveler, having no more interest in digging into what he suspected would be a painful past, instead offering to be a sparring partner if they chose to so he could see new techniques they acquired and share pointers with them.
The Family Letter, Tattered Letter and Matsudaira's dialogue reveal that he is actually Kenji Kazumichi. The real Masanori had deserted to the Watatsumi Army after killing a senior of theirs at some "fateful battle" which shook him to the core. After an argument with Masanori, Kenji presumably slew him during one of the many battles in Nazuchi Beach, driving him insane.
Appearance
Nameless takes on the form of a Kairagi: Dancing Thunder.
Notes
* When challenging "Masanori" between 0:00 to 4:00, he will remark on being stronger and drag the player into a fight. He remains in the Kairagi Kairagi: Dancing Thunder Avenger State permanently during this fight and the player is given 5 minutes to defeat him.

<title>Dornman Port</title>
<text>Dornman Port is a port in Mondstadt, although its exact location is unclear. So far, it has only been mentioned through NPC dialogue and character stories.
Overview
Dornman Port's geographical location has not been contextualized, but Henry Morton states it is "too far away" from the Nameless Island to try reaching the place by boat,Henry Morton and its distance from the City of Mondstadt is large enough that the Knights of Favonius' Reconnaissance Company, led by Eula, has to constantly patrol the trading route between Dornman Port and Mondstadt City during Weinlesefest.Charity Event! A Great Success!
Eula and her company once tracked down a dangerous hidden cargo belonging to the Abyss Order to Dornman Port, where it was about to be shipped to Liyue Harbor. Yanfei was, at that time, working as a consultant for the merchant vessel; unaware of the cargo's true nature, she started investigating it after discovering something in it, putting herself in great danger. She was saved from this perilous situation by Eula, and the two then cooperated to investigate and capture all the Abyss Order operatives hiding in the vicinity of the port.
Mona's parents moved to Dornman Port from elsewhere. She was born there and found Barbeloth, after which she settled down in Mondstadt City.Hunters, Prophets
Jones, originally a menial worker at Dornman Port, was recruited by the Kanjou Commission to be a sailor, only to arrive in Ritou and discover that he couldn't leave due to the Sakoku Decree. Following the events of 'Transient Dreams' and the repeal of the Sakoku Decree, Jones returns to Mondstadt via the port in Mondstadt City, but has not yet returned to Dornman Port.
Recently, a trading route has opened up between Dornman Port and Port Ormos, Sumeru. A trading company from Dornman Port plans on exporting fruit, although a reply on to their message on the Port Ormos Bulletin Board voices the replier's doubts about the fruit's quality after such a long journey.Port Ormos Bulletin Board Trading Company Advertisement</text>

<title>Liyue/Culture</title>
<text>The nation of Liyue is marked by its emphasis on "contracts," Morax's ideal. It is said that people from all seven nations of Teyvat flock to Liyue Harbor, the economic hub of the continent.
Life in Liyue
Many people in Liyue tend to live in small villages, such as Mingyun Village Mingyun, Qingce Village Qingce and Qiaoying Village, though people are also known to reside in larger areas such as Liyue Harbor. The villages are mainly occupied by the young and old, as many able-bodied people tend to go to the city for employment.
If a village's inhabitants are struggling to make ends meet, they will often abandon the area to look for better prospects, as shown with Mingyun Village and several other, abandoned settlements that can be found across the nation. The Liyue branch of Treasure Hoarders are fairly active compared to the other nations, with many usually prowling around less-traveled roads or operating inside The Chasm: Underground Mines The Chasm.
Many people revere the adepti, and some occasionally make pilgrimages to their adobes, high in the mountains of Jueyun Karst.
Agriculture
Compared to Mondstadt's lush plains, Liyue's rocky and mountainous geography is less suited for agriculture. Nevertheless, places like Qingce Village have managed to build terraced rice fields, whose crops can then be taken to Liyue Harbor to be sold. Sunsettia trees can be found across Liyue.
Over 3,000 years ago, Guili Plains and its surrounding areas were bountiful and one of its rulers, Guizhong, led her people in making agriculture their livelihood.Stone Tablet Compilations: Vol. I However, during the Archon War, the area was destroyed to such an extent that even in modern times, the land has never completely recovered. While some trees and grasses have managed to grow, the land is mostly uninhabited by humans.
Architecture
The architecture in Liyue is reminiscent of the style of Chinese architecture ancient Chinese architecture, with similar color schemes and hints, such as the eaved rooftops of many of the buildings and the warm color palette.
In a study, furnishings must be placed in a specific location and angle. There are apparently three schools of thought and nine areas of specialization on this subject.Zhongli
Cuisine
Category:Liyue Dishes
Liyue has two main culinary styles: the Li style, which focuses on bold, rich flavors using ingredients picked from the mountains, and the Yue style, which favors lighter-flavored seafood.Xi'er The two styles have a long history in Liyue and have been locked in bitter rivalry for just as long; fans of one style often clash with fans of the other. In Liyue Harbor, Liuli Pavilion and Xinyue Kiosk are the most reputable restaurants of their respective styles, and are both located in the city's shopping district, Feiyun Slope.
Chihu Rock, which is the relatively poorer end of the city,Chongyun's Hangout Event Signs of Evil Act I quest: For A Child's Smile has Chongyun and the Traveler seek out Dalong, a boy who lives in Chihu Rock; his family is poor and sometimes cannot afford to buy food. focuses more on street food but has some up-and-coming restaurants of their own, such as Wanmin Restaurant.
Tea is very popular among the people of Liyue; Qiaoying Village is renowned for its tea leaves, which can be served as drinks or made into tea cakes. Serving tea is also very complex, with every establishment having their own take, and the idea of serving tea via tea bags is completely foreign, though likely frowned upon.
During breakfast, dim sum is a popular choice of food, which consists of sweet or savory ready-made or made-to-order food. When served with tea, it is known as yum cha.
Education
It appears that education in Liyue largely depends on the person's wealth and social standing. Ren'yu and Lan both come from the lower ranks of society; the former is incapable of interpreting simple drawings, while the latter states that she is illiterate and leaves all the business to Katheryne despite being the guild master. Tutors are implied to be in high demand for more affluent families; Xingqiu and his sibling(s) are particularly well-educated due to their family's wealth and position.
Apart from general education, some people join "clans" for martial arts training, one of the more known clans being the Guhua Clan.
Medicine
Medicine in Teyvat
Thanks to Baizhu, an expert physician and maker of medicine who also has access to Changsheng's powers - though most people are unaware of this - medicine in Liyue is relatively comprehensive, with Bubu Pharmacy and Baizhu himself renowned even beyond Liyue.Miracle Medicine
Chenyu Vale also has its own medicine practices.
Music
The soundtracks for Liyue contains a lot of string instruments and percussions. The music usually has high, clear notes, and classical Chinese instruments like the erhu, guzheng and dizi are used.
Technology
Ancient technology constructed by gods and humans can be seen around Liyue, such as Guizhong Ballista and Dunyu Ruins.

Designs, Motifs, and Symbols
Symbols in Teyvat
The following designs, motifs, and symbols are typically seen within Liyue or on Liyue-related parties.
Liyue typically incorporates geometric designs into its architecture and design work. Meander (art) Meanders are a common decorative design, and diamonds are a common shape in various emblems found throughout Liyue.
Character Cards
The overall shape of Liyue Character Cards contains a large circle with a diamond inlaid in the center. Four paper lanterns are on either side of the diamond, with the Liyue Vision shape at top center with the character's element inlaid inside and two Ginkgo leaves on either side of it. The icons inside the paper lanterns vary based on the character's affiliations.
Adepti and adepti-related characters will have icons of Liyue's sacred beasts: a dragon at top left, a stag at top right, a qilin at bottom left, and a crane at bottom right. The characters who have this version are: Ganyu, Qiqi, Xianyun, Xiao, Yanfei, and Zhongli.
Characters who do not use the adepti's version will instead contain emblems representing the notable trade sectors of Liyue Harbor: The Mora triquetra at the top left as symbol of the Golden House's Mora mint, a Silk Flower at top right as symbol for the fabric trades such as the Feiyun Commerce Guild as well as for the herbal and pharmaceutical trades such as the Bubu Pharmacy, a ship representing Liyue Harbor's trade fleets and shipyards as well as The Crux at bottom left, and a sword (specifically Prototype Rancour) and polearm (either Black Tassel or White Tassel) crossed at bottom right as symbol of their smithies and forges such as the Blackcliff Forge.
Multi-Diamond
The multi-diamond symbols are likely based on Chinese traditional motif "Fangsheng" (方胜纹).
Alongside the Geo symbol, which naturally represents the Geo Archon, the Geo Archon symbol '(unofficial name)' can be found in places associated with Morax. It is comprised of one central square diamond, with smaller square diamonds at each corner. This symbol can be found at Yuehai Pavilion, where the Yiyan Temple dedicated to Morax can be found, and on the back of Zhongli's clothing. The Polearm "polearm" icon also contains the Geo Archon symbol.
File:Zhongli back.PNG|The back of Zhongli's coat
The triple diamond '(unofficial name)' is a design motif most prominently seen on the effects of the Liyue Series weapons, although it can also be seen on places such as Xinyan's sleeves. It is comprised of two smaller diamonds surrounding one large diamond, with another shape (typically another diamond) in the center of the large diamond.
Note: The Mondstadt-based Millennial Movement Series weapons' effect has a similar symbol, but only has two diamonds instead of three.
Cloud Motif
A traditional stylised clouds decorative pattern called "Xiangyun (Auspicious clouds) Xiangyun" (祥云, Auspicious clouds).
Auspicious Symbols
Design motifs below can be seen on stone bricks and inside certain instances in Liyue.
The Scales
Scales and balances are associated with Liyue. The most commonly seen usage is on Pressure Plates.
Economy
Liyue's economy is very reliant on its harbors. People from Snezhnaya like Ivanovich are traders in Liyue, and a fisherman mentioned that he used to import goods from Inazuma over to Liyue before the lockdown. Local Liyue specialties like Chilibrew and silk are known in other countries. The Dawn Winery sells their beverages to Liyue trading unions and individual merchants, who then resell them inside or to other nations. Liyue also exports cloth to Inazuma, primarily Ogura Textiles & Kimonos. Qiaoying Village is known for its high-quality tea, supplying both the local and foreign markets. Liyue Harbor handles commerce with Mondstadt, Inazuma, Sumeru and likely Snezhnaya, while Yilong Wharf mainly handles commerce with Fontaine.
While the Qixing, mostly the Yuheng, have helped keep the roads safer by cracking down on banditry, there is still a large demand for escorting goods. Some people have set up Local Security Agencies to help merchants transport and protect goods; because these agencies are independently operated, standardizing them has proven to be an issue for the Qixing. One of the more known and reputable security agencies is the Secure Transport Agency.
The country has several industries overseen by the Eight Trades, eight commerce sectors under the jurisdiction of the Liyue Qixing. Of the eight, only four are known; the Communications office, presumably specializing in judiciary matters, Huishan Hall, which presumably specializes in mining, Shenglu Hall, which specializes in glazed ceramics, and Yinyuan Hall, which specializes in salt.
Liyue also has a vast mining and smithing industry in place. Blackcliff Forge is where the Blackcliff Series Blackcliff and Prototype Series were made. In addition to creating weapons, the forge also doubles as a mine. When the ores in Mingyun Village were almost exhausted, the villagers abandoned the mine and moved west to seek better prospects. The Chasm is the most reputed mine in the nation, as many miners find employment there. Due to a series of unknown incidents, the Liyue Qixing had temporarily shut the mine down and initially worked with the Fatui to investigate, but after Childe's betrayal, they cut them off. Once the Traveler manages to find what appeared to be the main culprit, the Qixing has begun to let small groups of experienced miners back in.
The nation was also the sole minter of Mora due to Morax's Gnosis, some of which are kept in the nation, while the rest are sent to the other nations. However, he eventually gave up his Gnosis per an agreement with the Tsaritsa; in the process, he also forgot to find an alternative plan, resulting in no new Mora being circulated for the time being.
Fashion
The fashion in Liyue seems to also take inspiration from Chinese fashion such as the cheongsam and the hanfu. It should be noted that clothing styles of Liyue are based on no particular dynasties, though they all are inspired by Chinese culture.
Men's Fashion
Suling has a customized fifth version which forgoes the shirt underneath the vest and instead wraps his torso with bandages.
Some of the shirts that males wear in Liyue are based off the tangzhuang, as seen in the decorations on the front of the shirt.
Women's Fashion
Girls in Liyue tend to wear short, knee length dresses that have a resemblance to the Chinese qipao. Women who lived in Liyue Harbor tend to wear long dresses with similar details to the qipao. Madame Ping's clothes seemed to be inspired by the hanfu, an ancient style of clothing. This could be a reference to Madame Ping's age.

Exorcists and thaumaturges have their own recognizable attire.For A Child's SmilePure Spirit Chongyun and Shenhe are both exorcists from the same clan, although the latter lives a life of seclusion in the mountains of Liyue. There are currently no NPCs wearing exorcist or thaumaturge attire.

Rite of Descension
The Rite of Descension zh=七星请仙典仪 zh_rm=Qīxīng Qǐng Xiān Diǎn Yí zh_tl=Qixing's Adeptus Invitation Ceremony is an annual event that occurs in Liyue Harbor. The Liyue Qixing invite the Geo Archon, Morax, to the mortal realm to give his divine predictions for the upcoming year, which the Qixing use to determine Liyue's policies and business trends.
It is unknown how many predictions are typically made per year, but the year before the Traveler and Paimon visited Liyue, Morax gave 17 predictions.Rite of Descension
Unlike Rite of Partings, which are used to commemorate deceased adepti, the Rite of Descension appears to be open to all people and is a popular tourist attraction. Liyue people who live abroad will also often make a pilgrimage home to witness the Rite of Descension.Musheng However, life in Liyue Harbor largely continues as normal otherwise, and most of the city's residents don't attend the event.
Languages
Several different languages are used simultaneously in Liyue. Alongside the Languages Teyvat Language common language, a Liyue Language local language that resembles Chinese seal script can be found throughout Liyue, such as signs and even certain character skill animations. On a few occasions, in-game books have explained the significance of names derived from the "local language."
Idioms
Liyue is known for its idioms and sayings, a few of which have been brought up throughout the game. Because idioms tend to depend on cultural context, they are sometimes altered for the English localization to fit the spirit of the saying.

A Merchant's Memory of Liyue
When I received the invitation from the Merchant and Adventurers' Guilds of Liyue to write a piece on Liyue Harbor, I hesitated for a long time before finally embracing the challenge. Sure, I have been running a caravan around Teyvat with my father for as long as I can remember. Those born and raised in Liyue aside, there is no one in Teyvat who knows every route in and out of Liyue as well as I. With that said, I've met my share of exceptional poets and writers on the road, and I would never consider myself a writer of their caliber. Therefore, I'm afraid I must apologize in advance for my lack of literary ability to write a real page-turner. So, please bear with me.
Even when I was young, Liyue Harbor, the greatest trading port in all of Teyvat, already meant wealth and prosperity to everyone in our caravan. I remember, back then, every time when the children heard the caravan was going to Liyue, they'd beg for a place in the caravan. Though it was a long time ago, the memory of the bustling streets, noisy crowds, and the wonders lying on the shop shelves are all still so vivid to me. I can still remember the mysterious and enticing scents calling out to me from the snack stalls.
When I came of age, I was entrusted with the family business. I then led the caravan between all the major cities across Teyvat. As the world opened up to me, Liyue also became a lot more to me than just the port I used to run around barefoot in as a kid.
From my understanding of Liyue Harbor's history, I can dare to make a bold conclusion on just how Liyue came to be so rich. Just as any other prosperous city in Teyvat, Liyue's prosperity came from its geographic advantages. Liyue is a harbor city surrounded by mountains on three sides. Beyond the mountains inland, there are vast foothills, plains, fords, and abundant mines full of precious ores. These ores are harvested and made into exquisite crafts at the hands of skilled craftsmen. The founding of the harbor and the establishment of the sea routes were instrumental in popularizing Liyue's commercial trade, as it was the export of crafts that laid the initial foundation for Liyue's financial development. Even now, Liyue's exquisite crafts are still prized by people across the continent.
After all these years, the sea routes leading into Liyue are now very well established. Trade vessel is the ideal travel method for anyone wanting to conduct business in Liyue. However, for common travelers and tourists, the land routes are recommended for a richer sightseeing experience as opposed to being on the great blue for prolonged periods of time.
Due to the complex terrain surrounding Liyue, the most common route there by land starts out from Mondstadt's Dawn Winery, then heads southwest. The route takes travelers through Mondstadt's signature landscapes. Enjoy some locally-grown fruit from Mondstadt on the way, and when the open plains are replaced by mountains and lakes, you'll be nearing Mondstadt's border.
Follow the edge of the lake west, and you will see two towering cliffs, serving as a natural boundary that separates Liyue and Mondstadt, with a narrow passage in between them paved with wooden planks. On the rare occasions that I pass through this way, I'm usually focused on getting through as quickly as possible. Though on one occasion I found myself traveling alongside an elderly fisherman. Along the way he covered a wide range of topics, from the identification of different species of river fish, to the ancient legends of Liyue. He said, the lakes in the gorge were blessed water bodies set by Rex Lapis and therefore stopping there may bring you closer to the Archons.
I used to laugh superstitious beliefs off, but my vivacious romanticist of a wife believed what he said. Ever since then, my caravan would rest here for a bit before continuing on, in the hopes of receiving blessings from the gods.
After passing through Stone Gate, the view opens up, revealing the classic outskirt views of Liyue: bodies of water reflecting the skies, and patches of green plants jut out from between shoals and fords. Far in the distance in Dihua Marsh is Wangshu Inn, which sits on top of a giant stone pillar, serving as a landmark for caravans passing through the region. Some foreign traders conduct their business with the local merchants right there, while others rest a bit and gather some trade info before continuing on to Liyue Harbor.
It would probably take a whole book for me to write down every little thing about my past experiences with Liyue from my youth to this day, so I'll stop right here. I don't really know how to conclude things, so I guess I'll just say this: I hope I am remembered by some that I've met out on the road.
P.S. Many thanks to the Merchant and Adventurers' Guilds for giving me a chance to relive my beautiful memories of Liyue. I'd also like to thank my wife, Claire, for her help in infusing some much-needed vitality into my otherwise dull and poor writing.

<title>Noelle/Lore</title>
<text>Like most of Mondstadt's young people, Noelle always dreamed of being a knight of Favonius when she grew up.She may not have what it takes to be a knight just yet, but she is learning. Working as a maid at the Knights' headquarters, she is constantly taking notes on what constitutes knightly speech, knightly conduct, and knightly customs.She holds firm to her belief that one day she will join their ranks - she just needs to keep trying her hardest at everything she does.
Personality
A maid who faithfully serves the Knights of Favonius. She dreams of joining their ranks someday.
Noelle is a polite young woman and professional maid, helping those in need without hesitation, regardless of how far they are or what they need done, as long as they say her name. She has a very high standard of work ethic, as she always strives to ensure that everyones' needs are satisfied and always makes the effort to go over their expectations. No work is a problem for her; Lisa believes that the more work she is given, the happier she is.
Despite this, she is relatively stubborn and inexperienced; she states that she is useless in an argument and simply does what she believes is best, regardless of the other party's advice. Likewise, her attempts to meet everyone's needs is double-edged; although most people are genuine, others can take advantage of her generosity. Jean also considers her to be eligible for the Knights, but refrains from knighting her because she is worried that she is not ready for what lies outside Mondstadt.
She looks up to all of the Knights and asks them for advice on how to be a proper member when she officially joins, regardless of how much experience they may have, such as the rambunctious Klee. Her aspiration of joining them means that she will refuse any other invitations offered to her.
Appearance
Armored Rose
Noelle uses the Medium Female Characters medium female model. She has short, neck-length pale gray hair with a straight fringe and lopsided locks of hair framing her face. A section of hair is braided over her bangs and pinned down at the right side of her face with a gold shield clip. Her eyes are olive green.

Whether it's a Knights of Favonius dinner party, a winery banquet, or just an ordinary barbecue, Noelle is a whirlwind of helpfulness that will burst through your door at the first sign of a problem and whisk it away for you.
It's no wonder that people have taken to calling her the "Wondermaid."
But ask Noelle and she'll tell you there's nothing wondrous about the way she works, let alone magical. She just takes pride in her work and is constantly in pursuit of perfection.
"Nothing more, nothing less. Just as it should be, and not as it should not be."
Character Stories
Noelle has much greater dreams and ambitions than other maids in the Knights of Favonius.Like anyone else in this city protected by the Knights of Favonius, she too dreams of donning the honored armor.Even if her skills are not enough to pass the rigorous selection trials, she still wishes to observe and learn from them every chance she gets.Aside from her training, she enjoys her current life, helping everyone in need."You can leave absolutely anything to me!"That's her signature line. If there's anything that you need, Noelle is glad to be of aid.
Noelle is "the maid of all maids" to many.Such people also tend to say this of her: "She's everywhere."For example, there was a child who once tried to get a plate during a banquet, but found that there was no way to open the cabinet without all the plates falling out..."Noelle!!!!!!"All the child needed to do was scream, and Noelle appeared. She put the cabinet down on its back, took a plate out, and handed it to the child, reminding him not to have cold drinks immediately after having barbecue. Then she righted the cabinet, cleaned up other plates, and then put them back in order.Noelle's ability to be everywhere all at once is something miraculous to many.However, the job of a maid is no myth or legend. Noelle only does her job to the letter."No more, no less. As it should be, not as it should not be."Noelle doesn't think herself special, only that she thinks too much at times.
Noelle is always eager to help, sometimes excessively so.If you were to ask her how to build a campfire as she passed by, she would not only stop and build the campfire for you, she would also put up the grill racks, season the food, cook it for you, taste it herself to make sure it's done, and remind you to put out the fire when you've finished so as not to burn the forest down. Then she would get back to whatever she had been doing beforehand.Of course, most people don't mind at all that she regularly goes the extra mile. But it can sometimes produce unexpected results...For example, a Landa merchant from Snezhnaya once came to Mondstadt, ostensibly wishing to get into the winery business. In truth, he had an evil plot to ruin the land, destroy the winery business in Mondstadt altogether and then seize the market with wines from Snezhnaya.He disguised himself as an honest merchant with his family on a business trip to Mondstadt. Naturally, with them being visitors from afar, Noelle gave them a warm reception.Initially, the merchant was delighted with Noelle's hospitality; it was a cut above the crude etiquette he had come to expect from most peasants in Mondstadt. However, after a while he began to feel that something was amiss.Noelle seemed to be able to read his mind: She correctly guessed his schedule, cooked his family's favorite Snezhnayan dishes for them each day, and even knew that Tia his daughter liked to go to bed hugging a ragdoll, presenting her with a hand-made doll she had sewn together herself.This spooked the merchant, and made him hesitant to execute the next phase of his plan. Noelle's warm smile now chilled the merchant to the bone. What else did she know, and what was she really planning?In the end, the merchant fled Mondstadt with his family.Noelle was upset for a few days, thinking she had somehow insulted her guests. Little did she know that all of Mondstadt was indebted to her for taking her job so seriously.
Most of the time, Noelle's reliability provides a comforting presence, but there are always exceptions.Once, she learned that an adventurer was trapped on Dragonspine, so she decided to mount a rescue by herself.The snowstorm that day was terribly fierce, wiping out any tracks left by humans as soon as they were made. It was impossible to find a safe route to proceed, to say nothing of saving the adventurer amidst the snow.However, Noelle persisted on searching for the adventurer and eventually found him inside a cave, suffering from severe hypothermia.At the time, her coat was completely soaked, and the water inside her bottle had turned to ice. Thirsty and hungry, Noelle still managed to carry the adventurer down on her back.The adventurer was saved, but Noelle, having over-exerted herself, laid in bed for three days straight, suffering from a high fever. Everyone in the Knights of Favonius barely slept out of concern for her during that period. Fortunately, Noelle recovered.It was not the first or second time that something similar had happened, and everyone was deeply worried for Noelle.In order to prevent Noelle from putting herself in harm's way again, Jean had to invent some safe jobs to keep Noelle busy. If something were to happen, then Kaeya would have to save the day.During the Stormterror threat, Noelle was also eager to resolve the threat at its source. However, Kaeya managed to arrange quite a few "urgent matters" for her to attend to inside the city until it was all over.
Noelle's petite form does a good job of hiding her great strength.This does not just refer to her resoluteness or her indomitable spirit, but also her physical strength.Once, Lisa accidentally dropped her experimental apparatus under her bookshelf and troubled over whether she could remain decent while bending over to retrieve it. Noelle made it over in the nick of time, lifting the full bookshelf with only one hand - and not a single book fell out between her hefting it and putting it down.There was another incident in which several cargo-bearing carts were attacked by Pyro Slimes as they tried to pass through Mondstadt's side gate. As the owners were all in a panic, it was Noelle again who came to the rescue - hurling the carts - cargo and all, into the Cider Lake, before leaping into the water herself and retrieving every last item.Rumor has it that when Noelle was studying the blade, she nearly sent Wagner - who prided himself in his forging skills - into despairing seclusion.In all, he forged over ten different swords with different alloy compositions for Noelle, but all would lose their edge after a few uses.At first, Wagner thought Noelle unskilled, but eventually found that the problem was more foundational: the swords just weren't strong enough.Putting his reputation on the line, Wagner finally made Noelle a sturdy and heavy claymore that was further reinforced by her affinity for Geo. Only then was her weapon issue (barely) solved.But don't worry, Noelle won't use her superhuman strength unless the situation calls for it, as she is a pacifist at heart.They say, however, that the very day Noelle received her Favonius Greatsword custom-made claymore, she was set upon by a pair of drunken Treasure Hoarders in Drunkard Gorge, who thought her a harmless lamb...Let's just hope that no one else will ever be so unlucky.
Noelle's greatest enemy, curiously, is not a person, but Ludi Harpastum itself.During Ludi Harpastum, long tables arranged in a circular shape and filled with all kinds of food will be set up in the plaza before the Favonius Cathedral Cathedral for everyone to enjoy.The food is usually prepared by volunteers who can cook. During this time, Noelle, who always holds herself to a high standard, joins the volunteers in continuously cooking and serving food.It's not really any additional work; what's difficult is that she insists on tasting every dish to make sure they are up to standard.The crispy Moon Pies; the sizzling Mondstadt Pork Chops; the towering "Pile 'Em Up" Pile 'Em Ups - all the fried and barbecued foods, equal parts delicious and fatty, are customary at the festival.The smiles on people's faces make Noelle truly happy. What makes her less so is seeing her bulging belly. She can't help but let out a sigh.For the entire month following the festival, Noelle will volunteer for the Knights of Favonius' city night patrol.The festival may be over, but her battle is only beginning.
The maids of the Knights have many "red lines" that are not to be crossed, and one of these is that "the personal information of the Knights must be kept in strict confidence."This does not only require restricting outsider access to such information - this restriction also applies to other members of the Knights.For example, what Jean keeps in her private quarters, the contents of Amber's Baron Bunny, the number of special eye patches that Kaeya owns, the number of Klee's hidden bomb caches... These things are all top secret.To avoid leaking such information, Noelle used red cloth to make a great many roses - in Mondstadt, this flower means "my lips are sealed."She specially wove one such rose into her gauntlet as an ever-present reminder to herself.Revealing secrets would be a major dereliction of duty for a maid, and those who aspire to be knights cannot afford such errors.So you can forget about probing Noelle for any secrets. She won't tell.
Noelle did once wish to fulfill her dream before its time. Some years ago, after failing her seventh selection test, which was really a foregone conclusion, she felt somewhat discouraged.The etiquette, swordsmanship, the lines she had memorized... had they all gone to waste? She remembered all the strong points of every official knight, but who would remember the hard work of a failure like her?She had never stopped aspiring to become a Knight of Favonius, but her exhausted body wouldn't let her get back on her feet like she normally would. She felt like someone who had spent days and nights traveling through an icy tundra.At that moment, the main gate of the Knights Headquarters were flung upon, and out walked Acting Grand Master Jean, who had just been in charge of the selection process.Without a thought, Noelle gave a precise knight's salute.Immediately, she knew that this was too abrupt a thing to do, and wondered what Jean might think of her.But just as she was wishing that there was some hole she might crawl into to flee, Jean stopped in her own tracks and returned the salute.After a moment's surprise, Noelle gave a strained smile, clumsy but pure.This was a lucky day that she would always remember, for she would receive recognition from two all-important sources this day: once from Jean, and the other from the gods.Her hard work had been remembered after all.From that day forward, Vision in hand, Noelle reaffirmed her belief that she would one day be able to don that armor. That she would be gentle and reliable - and yes, everywhere at once too.

<title>Vision Hunt Decree</title>
<text>It seems that nobody has obtained an Electro Vision for a whole year now. [...] I've also heard it said that Inazuma's Electro Archon has proclaimed a "Vision Hunt Decree," which has aimed to confiscate the majority of all Visions from Vision wielders throughout Inazuma. Those who disobey and withhold their Visions will be punished severely...
The Vision Hunt Decree ja=目狩り令 ja_rm=Megari-rei was an order given one year prior to the current events of the game by Inazuma's Electro Archon, Ei (as the Raiden Shogun); and the Inazuma Shogunate, to seize all Visions within Inazuma's borders and inlay them upon the hands of a Statue of the Omnipresent God statue of the Thousand-Armed, Hundred-Eyed God. The Tenryou Commission, one of the Tri-Commission, is responsible for executing the decree.A Path Through the Storm In Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow, it is the reason behind the Vision Hunt Ceremony.
By Chapter II, Act II: Amidst Stormy Judgment, 99 Visions had been seized, and as of Chapter II, Act III: The Omnipresent God, these Visions have been returned to their owners.
History
The Vision Hunt Decree began as a Fatui plot to generate conflict to destabilize Inazuma and create a market for their Delusions.Delusion (Quest) They conspired with the Tenryou Commission Tenryou and Kanjou Commissions, promising Kujou Takayuki their support and generous rewards if he enforced it; Takayuki, believing that the Fatui could not truly pose a threat to Inazuma, agreed, deceiving the Raiden Shogun into perpetuating the decree.Blind Loyalty, Reckless Courage Ei, the Raiden Shogun's true identity, was aware of the Fatui's involvement but tacitly approved of the decree regardless, believing that the individual ambition that Visions represented would only cause loss and suffering and was incompatible with her ideal of eternity.The Omnipresent God
Those who serve the Shogun are seen as exceptions to the Decree so long as they remain useful: Kujou Sara, the general of the Tenryou Commission and the Shogun's bodyguard/aide, remained in possession of her Electro Vision. On the other hand, Kurosawa Kyounosuke, who worked with the Tenryou Commission, had his Vision seized after he was dismissed for "poor" performance.
The decree has stirred controversy across Inazuma. People who do not oppose the government but oppose the Decree have covertly created fake Visions as decoys. The Watatsumi Army, which declared war against the Shogunate, consists of members who have lost or fear losing their Visions, as well as those who oppose the Sakoku Decree that was imposed at the same time as the Vision Hunt Decree. The resistance also helps hide those who are unwilling to fight the Shogun and her army. Those who lost their Visions to the decree began suffering from a loss of ambition, apart from Arataki Itto and Kuki Shinobu, who were seemingly unaffected by the loss of their Visions.
Around the same time the Vision Hunt Decree began, Electro Visions ceased being bestowed upon anyone in Teyvat,Endless Research although people in Inazuma continued to receive Visions.A Flower Blooms in a Prison The matter drew the attention of researchers at the Sumeru Akademiya, who came to believe it was the will of the Electro Archon. However, Ei has denied responsibility and expressed surprise at this occurrence, stating that she is not responsible for the distribution of Visions.
The instability in Inazuma caused by the Vision Hunt and Sakoku Decrees has caused even those without Visions to avoid Inazuma for fear of the danger in the region. One such person is Alrani, who considered traveling there to research the decree, but decided against it after concluding that if those blessed with Visions are suffering, it could be even more dangerous for regular people, which is confirmed by Atsuko and Bibo. Alrani later traveled to Inazuma anyway out of desperation for a research topic, as those related to Inazuma are less popular, and she realized that not having a Vision could be advantageous for conducting research in Inazuma.In Another Land
In the span of a year, 99 people have had their Visions seized. It is unknown if this includes the fake Visions.
After the Traveler defeated Ei in her realm by showing her the power of the seized Visions' aspirations, she agreed to repeal the decree. The seized Visions were also given back to their rightful owners, provided that they were still alive and/or their current location known.
Confiscation Status
Seized
* Arataki Itto
* Domon
* Iwakura Mitsunari
* Kuki Shinobu
* Kurosawa Kyounosuke
* Tejima
* Various members of the Watatsumi Army
After the Vision Hunt Decree ended, all seized Visions were reclaimed or returned to their owners, provided they were still alive and in a position to receive their Visions.
Attempted
* Hanshirou
* Kaedehara KazuhaYouTube:
* Kazuha's friendThe friend was killed, but his Vision was taken by Kazuha before it could be seized.
* Thoma
* Yoimiya
After the Vision Hunt Decree ended, those who illegally evaded seizure were presumably given amnesty or a pardon. For example, Kazuha's arrest warrant was repealed.The Palace, Dyed in Black (Quest)
Unseized
The following individuals in Inazuma are known to have retained their Visions seemingly without incident during the Vision Hunt Decree:
* Kamisato Ayaka
* Kamisato Ayato
* Kujou Sara
* Sayu
* Thoma, prior to the Vision Hunt Ceremony
* Yae Miko
There are various reasons why these individuals could be seen in public with their Visions for a long period of time without being subjected to attempts at seizure:
* They are serving under the Shogun and enforcing her will, though this was proven to not serve as indefinite protection through the seizure of Kurosawa Kyounosuke's Vision.
* They are affiliated with a clan or organization with high social status, though this was proven to not serve as indefinite protection through the attempted seizure of Thoma's Vision.
* They have a personal relationship with the Raiden Shogun.
Based on the above, the following individuals are likely but unconfirmed to have retained their Visions without incident:
* Shikanoin Heizou
Unknown
It is unknown if any of the following individuals in the Watatsumi Resistance have been subjected to any attempt to take their Visions:
* Gorou
* Sangonomiya Kokomi
Additionally, it is unknown when Kirara and Chiori got their Visions and, if they received it before the Vision Hunt Decree ended, whether the two were subjected to any attempts to seize it.

<title>Alrani</title>
<text>Alrani is a researcher and a scholar of Sumeru Akademiya.
She admires her classmate Soraya, another researcher also studying the Liyue ruins, and wishes to be tutored by her.
Profile
Alrani is a scholar at the Sumeru Akademiya who is attempting to write her term paper. As of the World Quest 'In Another Land', she is currently on her third rewrite. She first wanted to write about Mondstadt, especially the Four Winds, but then learned that Dvalin had attacked Mondstadt. She then decided to go to Liyue, and, after being rescued from some Treasure Hoarders in 'And This Treasure Goes To...' by the Traveler, decided to write her paper on the Traveler's ability to control the Elements without a Vision in Endless Research. After having that paper rejected by her tutor, she left for Inazuma to write her paper on life in Inazuma. She encountered the Traveler again in Ritou, where she enlists their help to take photos around Ritou and ends up helping Vahid market the fertilisiers sold at Syavushi Bakshesh Shoppe in exchange for Vahid's help during the quest 'In Another Land'.
She soon went to Watatsumi Island to get some more information for her thesis. Completely oblivious to the situation on the island, she is initially detained by Hiroyuki and Ookubo Daisuke, only to be saved when the Traveler and fellow researcher Kaushik vouched her credibility as a Sumeru Akademiya researcher. Still helping Vahid with the fertiliser business, Gorou had her help Iwata with his fertiliser problem.
Once the Sakoku Decree was lifted, Alrani submitted her papers to her mentor, Niloofar. However, someone else had already submitted a paper with the same topic before her, causing her to become extremely depressed and run off to a group of Treasure Hoarders led by Narzam, paying them to stay with the group and refusing to return to the Akademiya. Narzam accepted due to her principles and acknowledged that she had a bright future and could use her intellect. After writing a letter, she asked the Traveler to give it to her mentor.
Appearance
Alrani is pale with long, light brown hair with a fringe and brown eyes. She wears rectangular black glasses, a long green, dark blue-black, yellow and white garment with long sleeves and black heels.</text>

<title>Archon War</title>
<text>The Archon War was an era of various power struggles between gods that began several thousand years ago for unknown reasons, although scholars in Teyvat believe it began over seven divine seats in Celestia.Treasure Lost, Treasure Found (Part 2) While different regions settled their power struggles at different times, the era drew to a close 2,000 years ago after the final seat was claimed.
With the end of an era came the establishment of a new order under the The Seven Seven Archons. They determined the seven elements in TeyvatAchievement: Colors of the RainbowThere is evidence that the seven elements system had existed in Teyvat before the Seven, such as the Seven Sovereigns, but there's currently little information to verify that. and established the seven nations, determining their method of governance through their ideals and shaping their nations using their elemental powers.
Overview
How or why the Archon War began is currently a mystery. Gods were able to coexist relatively peacefully before the War began, so the circumstances that triggered the Archon War are currently left to speculation. The logistics of the war are also unknown, such as how the nations were divided or how the victors were determined.
According to Soraya, the war began as a struggle over the seven divine seats in Celestia, both for supremacy and to see their plans for a prosperous humanity to come to fruition.Divine Body from Guyun However, not all gods participated in the war with the intent of taking a divine seat; some wanted to defend their territory, while others didn't even want to fight and tried to save as many people as possible from the destruction of the war.
An alternate explanation is that the death of gods 'removed' divine seats that previously existed in Celestia, and The Seven were either gods who kept their seats by prevailing over the others, or were beings who ascended to godhood after defeating gods of old. Decarabian's death resulted in the "crumbling of an ancient seat of divinity," while Barbatos ascended to godhood and became the Anemo Archon.
Neuvillette, the reborn Dragon of Water Hydro Sovereign, recalled his predecessor's memory after the return of the Ancient Authority, that "all fragments of the primordial were driven to devour each other." It is presumed that the aforementioned event is the Archon War, and the Primordial One manipulated the gods to eliminate each other.
After The Seven were established, most defeated gods fled Teyvat and took refuge in the Dark Sea - lands outside of Teyvat where The Seven have no dominion, where they became known as "evil gods." Some gods, however, chose to cooperate with The Seven and even became important figures, such as Andrius.
Mondstadt
2600 years ago, in the midst of the Archon War, the city of Mondstadt was located northwest of the current location, what is now known as Stormterror's Lair. Back then, there were two warring gods: Decarabian, the God of Storms, and Andrius, the King of the North Wind. The entity who would become Barbatos was but a wisp of the wind, with little to no power.
At that time, Mondstadt was a wasteland of ice, snow, and endless icy blizzards, almost impossible for humans to live in.Ring of BoreasBiography of Gunnhildr This was all caused by Andrius, who gained his powers from an ancient - and likely deceased - god.Andrius (Weekly Boss) In order to protect his people from the cold, Decarabian enclosed the city into a wall of storms, letting nothing go in or out of it; Andrius declared war on Decarabian, but was incapable of landing even a scratch on his tower. For his part, Decarabian seemed either uninterested in, or incapable of, defeating Andrius, and was content with keeping his people safe. Unbeknownst to Decarabian, however, his people felt trapped and worshipped him out of fear, which he mistook for genuine devotion.While the idea that Decarabian trapped his people within the city is often stated in Mondstadt's history books, this is contradicted by Biography of Gunnhildr, which claims that the Gunnhildr Clan took refuge in the city, then left after growing disillusioned by Decarabian's rule. It is possible that the people's dissatisfaction with his rule originated from his apparent inaction against Andrius, who turned the rest of Mondstadt into a frozen tundra. Over time this discontentment morphed into the belief that Decarabian was a tyrant who locked them within his city without cause.
During his time as a wisp of the wind, Barbatos befriended a Nameless Bard young bard who dreamt of freedom. He also saved the Gunnhildr Clan, who had left Decarabian's city to live in the frozen wasteland, and their resulting faith empowered him. Eventually, Barbatos and the Nameless Bard, alongside Decarabian's disillusioned lover Amos and an unnamed knight, raised an army against the God of Storms.Amos' Bow They eventually emerged victorious, taking down the god and freeing the people from his stormy cage. Unfortunately, both Amos and the bard were among the casualties, causing deep regret for Barbatos.
After Decarabian's demise, Barbatos claimed a divine seat in Celestia, becoming the first - and only - Anemo Archon among The Seven. Andrius, despite holding tremendous power, was aware that he was ill-fit for the role of a loving archon who could nurture humanity, as he found human society to be a disappointment and only accepted abandoned infants and outcasts as his kin.Boreal Wolf's Milk ToothBoreal Wolf's Cracked Tooth Believing himself unfit for the position of Anemo Archon, Andrius chose to disappear.Boreal Wolf's Nostalgia In his final days, he realized that his icy blizzards could only destroy life and decided to let his power flow into the land of Mondstadt instead, putting an end to the icy storm.Spirit Locket of Boreas Andrius would eventually return as a spirit, watching over the area now known as Wolvendom and working with Barbatos as one of his Four Winds.
Barbatos' first use of his powers was to take the form of the young bard as a way to honor him.Should You Be Trapped in a Windless Land (Quest) After that, he used his wind powers to shape the land to make it prosperous for his people, teaching them the values of freedom. He then left the people to themselves, refusing to rule them directly and risk becoming a tyrant himself.Abyss Mage (Quest) Instead, he journeyed throughout Teyvat, often paying visits to the Geo Archon, Morax, of the neighboring nation of Liyue.
Liyue
During the Archon War, Morax, Deus Auri, and Guizhong, the God of Dust, lived with the adepti and their people in the region now known as the Guili Plains. When the war began, they stood by each other and fought other gods. 3,700 years ago, Guizhong died in a particular battle which also ravaged the Guili Plains, and Morax took the people south of Mt. Tianheng and established Liyue Harbor.Stone Tablet Compilations: Vol. IThe Fond Farewell
After the establishment of Liyue Harbor, Morax continued to defend his people from other gods and monsters. One of his exploits was the war with an unknown god in Chenyu Vale. The war was implied to be particularly bloody, as the Bishui River was said to be crimson red. Morax easily overwhelmed the god, who then sought to flood the Bisuhi River in a final attempt to defeat him. This act would have also destroyed the vale, causing the god's adepti disciples, Fujin and the Herblord, to defect. The two rebeled against their master, along with their old friend, the suanni Lingyuan, to evacuate the people. The god's fate is unknown, but the Herblord fell in battle and Fujin "sank to the sea," losing much of her powers in the process.Chenyu's Blessings of Sunken Jade
Other notable feats of Morax were defeating and sealing various gods and sea monsters at Guyun Stone Forest with stone lances, among them were Osial and the Chi of Yore. Although they were defeated, the stone pillars became divine, but with hatred and curses within as well. Guoba Marchosius, the God of the Stove, was one of the gods who sacrificed his power and godly status to prevent the calamities and plagues caused by the war from finally destroying Liyue. The demons that were generated, however, posed a threat to the people, so Morax assigned a group of adepti called the Yaksha to eliminate them. The karmic debt accumulated proved to be too much for them, either perishing or disappearing; as of the present day, Xiao is the only alive and active yaksha.
Meanwhile, the Salt Goddess Havria, known for both her gentleness and relative weakness compared to other gods, tried to avoid the chaos of the Archon War and yearned for the peaceful days of old. However, in that brutal era, she found herself making more and more concessions until all she had left for her and her people was the land now known as Sal Terrae. In the end, she perished at the hands of her own people: realizing that her love and kindness was incapable of protecting them, the king of her people decided to slay her both as a demonstration of their decision to take a more militaristic stance,Diary of Roald the Adventurer and to spare her the agony of defeat and destruction at the hands of another god. On her death, however, the surge of power that emerged from her body turned anyone who had been in the area into salt. Those who survived were scattered throughout Liyue, most eventually settling in Liyue Harbor and forming Yinyuan Hall with a distorted version of events.Farewell, Sweet Salt
Inazuma
Little information exists about the Archon War in Inazuma. The Inazuman archipelago was united under the rule of the Electro Archon, the Raiden Shogun - which was Makoto (Baal), with her twin sister Ei (Beelzebul) serving as her 'kagemusha'. One of the gods they defeated was Orobashi who fled and found itself beyond the seal that separated Enkanomiya from the rest of Teyvat.Oathsworn Eye Since then, it rescued the people there, brought them back to the surface, and created Watatsumi Island using its own scales for its people. Orobashi and the people of Watatsumi lived peacefully within the nation of Inazuma up until Orobashi's rebellion against the Shogun.Sangonomiya ChroniclesThose Who Yearn for the Gods' GazeSangonomiya Chronicles states that Orobashi peacefully lived under the Electro Archon's rule, and 'Those Who Yearn for the Gods' Gaze' states that Orobashi invaded Yashiori Island and was killed there during the Archon War. Assuming both statements are true, Makoto may have became Electro Archon before the Archon War officially ended 2000 years ago, and then Orobashi attacked Yashiori Island at some point between their victory and the Archon War's official end.
Sumeru
Though without clear evidence, it is suggested that unlike other nations, the three God-Kings: King Deshret, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, and Goddess of Flowers peacefully shared the throne with each otherAmethyst Crown. King Deshret even went so far as to reject the position of Archon (with Gnosis and/or the Dragon Authority implicitly referred to as a "gift" given to him by Celestia)Wilting Feast Multiple events subsequently led to the deaths of King Deshret and the Goddess of Flowers,The death of Nabu Malikata and later, King Deshret, were stated to happen "thousands of years ago", according to Nahida. It is likely that they died during the Archon War period, leaving Greater Lord Rukkhadevata as the sole god. and Rukkhadevata thus was titled as the sole Archon of Sumeru. After Lesser Lord Kusanali erased Rukkhadevata from the Irminsul, the world now knew Kusanali as the Dendro Archon that arose from the Archon War.A Toast to Victory
Fontaine
Little evidence of the Archon War is known in Fontaine, though it likely coincided with Remuria's conquest of Fontaine. At this time, Egeria had been sealed away by Celestia for using Primordial Seawater to give human forms to the Oceanids. Meanwhile, the God King Remus, who ruled over the ancient civilization of Remuria, had begun obsessing over the Prophecy of Fontaine prophecy wrought on by Egeria's actions. In his attempts to bring all of Fontaine under his rule and thereby save everyone, Remus began a vicious campaign of conquest against the other tribes of Fontaine, whom he would either convince to join him or take by force.page=La Chanson d'Erinnyes Remuria eventually fell due to a rebellion led by the Dragon King Scylla, and Remus and his empire were dragged into the Abyss.page=Golden Night's Bustle Celestia then commanded Egeria to return from the "primeval prison" they had trapped her in and take over Remus' position in ruling Fontaine.page=Splendor of Tranquil Waters
After ascending as the Hydro Archon and cementing her rule, Egeria exiled all of the nation's criminals, who were treated as outcasts. Some of these criminals repented and begged for mercy, which she heard and granted by having them "protect" her Primordial Sea secret in the depths, which they did by constructing the Fortress of Meropide.
Conclusion
As the Archon War drew to a close 2,000 years ago,Equilibrium only the Seven remained, giving Teyvat the seven nations we know of today.
Only Barbatos and Morax remain from the original victors of the Archon War, while the other five nations' Archons have been replaced over the past 2,000 years. Makoto Baal died 500 years ago in the cataclysm and was been replaced by her twin sister, named Beelzebul, under the name "Baal." Similarly, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata also died 500 years ago in the cataclysm and has been replaced by her incarnation in the next samsara, Buer. The previous Hydro Archon - Egeria, perished during the cataclysm, her remains became the Amrita Pool while her consciousness was anchored to the Human Realm by the Harvisptokhm (grown by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata) to contain and cleanse the Abyssal defilement in the Girdle of the Sands, she was later succeeded by one of her familiars Focalors as the new Hydro Archon.
After Nahida purged Rukkhadevata from the Irminsul, the world's perception was changed and Nahida was now known as the only Dendro Archon since the Archon War. Zhongli's altered Character Story 5 now indicated that he and Barbatos were the only two of the first Seven to remain in positions of rulership. This supposes that Buer lost the ruler position due to her amnesia after exhausting her power during the cataclysm, and only regained her position recently. Thus, she is not viewed the same as Zhongli and Venti.

<title>Remuria</title>
<text>Stub
Remuria was the civilization in Fontaine which directly preceded the previous Hydro Archon Egeria's rule. It was created by the God Remus, who was known by his people as the God King, and its capital city was Capitolium.The History of the Decline and Fall of Remuria
Remuria's downfall occurred as a result of Remus' attempt to avert its predicted destruction, and in particular, by his act of sharing his power and authority - reserved only for gods - with the four human Harmosts he appointed to govern his cities. Records of the "Golden Troupe," which existed during this era, were largely lost during Remuria's sudden destruction; based on Rene's research, however, Jakob's unique physical constitution appears to relate to the Golden Troupe in some way.Book of Esoteric Revelations
Remuria would eventually be sunken into the Abyss, devouring everything including the people and Remus himself.
History
Remuria's creation, golden age, and downfall are recorded in 'The History of the Decline and Fall of Remuria', which was written 100 years after its destruction.
After the "first era" - likely the Primordial One's era - humanity began to covet things that belonged to Celestia and attempted to break away from their fates, and so they were punished by having their cities destroyed by tsunamis and then buried underwater after 100 days of rainfall, which "drowned all sin and arrogation" and forced humanity to rebuild civilization all over again. In Fontaine, no true civilization was built for a long time - long enough that Gurabad in Sumeru rose and fell - until Remus arrived on Meropis and taught the people there how to build houses, farm, and appreciate the arts, especially music. He conquered the other islands in the region and the "great dragon beneath the abyssal depths" yielded to him.
He believed that so long as the "harmonious symphony of prosperity" continued to play, Remuria would prosper forever. He set about perfecting his civilization, paying particular attention to his capital city, Capitolium.
However, Remuria was prophesied to face "the most utter destruction" and its peoples to return to the primordial sea. To escape the prophecy, Remus aimed to eliminate all which might bring about such destruction or who did not accept his rules: Lochfolks, Vishaps, Barbarians.
Hoping to make Remuria's peoples escape the flood, he mixed the primordial water with an immortal stone to create a Golden Ichor who would contain the souls and minds of his peoples and placed this Ichor full of souls into Golems, and tried to replace the entire Primordial Water with his golden Ichor.
Barbarians and Vishaps eventually started a rebellion under the leadership of the Dragon Scylla against Remus and his golem army and golden troupe. Remus eventually realized his wrongs while Remuria was being destroyed and gave out his final orders, attempting to restore peace back to Remuria. But it was already too late, the Harmost Boethius saw his retreat as a betrayal, stole the golden Ichor and sealed the Dragon Scylla with it.
Remuria and its peoples were swept away by the Abyss at the same time the Dragon was sealed. The golden Ichor is eventually corroded by the Primordial Sea and the survivors turned back into "Barbarism and Annihilation" until the Hydro Archon Egeria appeared and settled the conflicts between tribes, taking over as Fontaine's God.
Culture
Arts and Music
Music, whether literal or symbolic, played a particularly significant role in Remuria.Echoes of the Ancient World Remus introduced the beauty of music to his people because he believed that it "differentiated humans from other living things". Capitolium, the capital of Remuria, is described to be overflowing with beautiful melodies and also a paradise for artists and musicians where only the most outstanding intellectuals and musicians were allowed.
Politics
Remus elevated four humans of particular ability to become Harmosts, rulers over Remuria's cities. Two Harmosts are currently known: BoethiusSublimation of Pure Sacred Dewdrop and Cassiodor.Golden Song's Variation It is also implied that only the most outstanding intellectuals and musicians are allowed to serve Remus.
Architectures
Due to Remus' love for the arts, architectures also played a significant role in Remuria. The capital of Remuria, Capitolium, is a home to many theatres and palaces "adorned with the most sumptuous and intricate carvings". The grand temples and arenas were built with giant carved rocks to commemorate the city's glory and victory. The solid and towering walls are decorated with glaze and gold, bronze and marble statues.
The Palace of Remus is described to be a golden palace filled with towering copper pillars.</text>

<title>Mikoshi Clan</title>
<text>The Mikoshi Clan was a prominent Inazuman clan around five hundred years ago that continues to exist in the present.
Its most famous member was Chiyo, an oni who was close with the Raiden Shogun Ei. However, during the cataclysm, Chiyo was consumed and tainted by an abyssal beast; she later drew her blade on Ei, was defeated in battle, and disappeared. This betrayal tarnished the Mikoshi Clan's reputation.Emblem of Severed Fate
Overview
Five hundred years ago, those related to the Mikoshi Clan by blood had oni blood running through their veins.Sundered Feather description'"You are now 'Iwakura.' You are no longer the 'Mikoshi' who shoulders the burden of oni blood."' It is currently assumed that Chiyo was a full-blooded oni or at least recognizably oni,Mask of the Kijin but her biological son Iwakura Michihiro was described as a "mortal in whose veins runs the blood of the oni,"Magnificent Tsuba indicating his father was human and Doukei himself was more human than oni.
While the Mikoshi Clan continues to live on in the present day,Mikoshi Genjirou whether they have oni blood is unknown. Doukei abandoned his Mikoshi name and adopted the name "Iwakura," founding the Iwakura Clan. Meanwhile, the Mikoshi Clan descendants now living in Inazuma City are said to be the descendants of Mikoshi Nagamasa, who was adopted into the clan and was presumably human.The Narukami Trail Inagi Hotomi: His [Mikoshi Nagamasa's] bloodline has been passed down to this day. Most people in the city who have the surname Mikoshi today are his descendants.

<title>Dori/Lore</title>
<text>Dori is a merchant in Sumeru who has a fondness for glittering Mora.With her persuasive eloquence, she is able to sell various strange and mysterious products for a very high price.
Personality
An elusive merchant who has a fondness for glittering Mora.
Dori is a merchant of high regard in Sumeru, considered the most resourceful merchant who's able to acquire quality goods through her mysterious supply chain (which also includes Alice). She is extremely wealthy and highly obsessed with Mora, seeing everyone and everything as a way to make profit. Her obsession with Mora is due to the fact that her older sister had an illness which her family couldn't afford treatment for at the time. She uses her spontaneous appearance and words to sway customers into buying her goods despite her jaw-dropping prices.
Willing to make Mora off just about anything, Dori also partakes in the black market, which has also caught the Matras' attention. Due to this, she implemented some protocols to vet all potential customers to prevent her, her employees and potential customers from being held liable.
Appearance
I Love Mora
Dori uses the Short Female Characters short female model. She has fair skin, golden brown eyes, and short pink hair. She also wears a pair of small glasses with reddish lenses and gold diamond-shaped frames.
Official Introduction
Dori:The Mora, the merrier!
No matter how rare the experimental materials are, you can buy them from Dori. I don't know where she gets her goods from... Also, make sure you pay attention to the price when you buy from her. My heart aches every time I pay the bill.
The unpredictable and elusive Dori seems to have an uncountable number of treasures.
As the most "resourceful" merchant in Sumeru, she has a way to get you anything you need, be it precious gems, rare herbs, and exotic items that no one has ever heard of.
Of course, this doesn't come at a small price. Dori always has a warm smile on her face when quoting you jaw-dropping prices.
Some people see her as rain after a long drought, one that brings timely relief, while others regard her as an unscrupulous merchant who takes advantage of the situation.
But all this chatter doesn't faze Dori in the slightest. The only thing that echoes in the Palace of Alcazarzaray has always been the crisp sound of Mora tinkling.
Character Stories
"Dori Sangemah Bay, owner of the Palace of Alcazarzaray, super-duper merchant who sells everything you need!"When one holds Dori's name card, this impressive title instantly comes into view.Dori is, however, indeed the most special Sumeru merchant of all.She already possesses vast wealth, but is still fervently passionate about earning Mora;She already owns multiple well-renowned merchant caravans, yet she always travels across Sumeru to sell her marvelous items in person.Speaking of which, her wares are just as curious as her style: special travel kit, outdoor dryer machines, automatic snowball launchers... You can probably buy anything you can think of from Dori. The only question is: Do you have enough Mora to do so?
"Oh wow, are you headed for the desert? I have some good stuff you'll need there.""The rainforest is terribly infested with poisonous snakes, ferocious monsters, and a terminal case of humidity - it's no place for the less-than-thoroughly prepared, no sir! Now then, why don't you try bringing this for your trip? Buy it now and enjoy a 20 percent discount!""Hold your horses, hotshot. You're not taking that route, are you? There's a huge pack of monsters lying in wait ahead that-a-ways. But see, I have some weapons here that you won't regret purchasing - you know, for self defense!""Going to the Akhtamun Ruins? You've got the right person. First things first, you'll need a complete set of water-drawing tools... Which, as it happens, I happen to have for sale!"There is a tale among adventurers in Sumeru.It says that if you are about to embark on a journey into a dangerous place, you'll see a diminutive figure, seemingly having been waiting for you.Be it in the treacherous mountains, arid deserts, grim rainforests, or desolate areas inhabited by monsters, you'll always see her smiling face.Word has it that Dori carries all manner of marvelous items on her person all the time. Her items can help adventurers get through their pressing troubles.-At a "reasonable" price, of course.Adventurers who "have just received Dori's help in their time of need" at the cost of "paying a large sum of Mora at once" often develop conflicted feelings toward her - somewhere in between gratitude and a grudge.For Dori's part, she considerately ignores the conflicted look on their faces, putting the fresh Mora in her almost-bursting purse and bidding them adieu with a contented smile."Thank you for your generous purchase. Hehe."
From the perspective of others, Dori's business has always been on the up and up. However, only Dori herself knows how many unimaginable bottlenecks she's struggled through.There was a time when orders from all over Sumeru just kept flooding in and Dori couldn't deliver such a giant number of orders in a timely fashion.Unfortunately, the capacity of the usual merchant routes was too limited for the delivery of commodities in such a gigantic quantity.Many members of Dori's merchant caravans suggested rejecting certain orders to dial down the scale of delivery and maintain a decent, stable profit - one that already seemed set to make them immensely wealthy, given time.But Dori took a very bold step: She accepted all the orders while starting cooperation with the Kshahrewar to establish new trade routes in areas that were known to be dangerous.She opened the new routes up to nearby merchant caravans, took the opportunity to found a commerce guild and put the relevant resources to good use, and finally eliminated the bottleneck that her business was stuck in.Today, Dori's new, built-from-scratch merchant routes are seen all across Sumeru, and the good reputation of "Lord Sangemah Bay" has spread far and wide.The words Dori said to her caravan members have also become common knowledge:"I'm not some stupid toadstool. I don't cancel or reject any orders.""Every Mora that can be earned, will be earned by me. Why? Well, because it's there, of course."
Dori used to suffer terribly from insomnia. Back then, she would often lose sleep for no reason. After such sleepless nights, she would show up to trade meetings with a pair of raccoon eyes.Even the best doctors couldn't diagnose her properly. She burned one frankincense stick after another, and yet they did not lull her into sleep but into coughing fits instead.It was at that moment that a doctor passed by and told Dori this:"I've heard that some people place an hourglass by their bedside. The sound of the falling sand helps them sleep."Dori tried it for a few days and it didn't work. However, she was inspired by the failed attempt, ordering a large custom-made hourglass.That which was in this hourglass was not sand, but shiny Mora.That night, embraced by the music of jingling Mora, Dori slept soundly at last.After that, Dori learned the trick to dealing with insomnia:"To sleep well, you must first secure peace of mind."
Maybe it's because of her deep love for Mora, Dori also takes interest in "whoever or whatever might bring Mora in."For example, her merchant caravans use Shaggy Sumpter Beast Sumpter Beasts to carry cargo, so Dori had an "amusement park" built for the Sumpter Beasts such that they might enjoy their downtime.She also handpicks Sumpter Beast food of the best quality to make sure that they have balanced nutrition and that they stay in good health.Also, as a shrewd merchant, she never misses a single business opportunity.Sumpter Beasts playing together in the amusement park make for a fun scene, so Dori took the chance to open the amusement park to tourists and sold tickets, food, and souvenirs to them. The cost of raising the Sumpter Beasts was covered by the amusement park's revenue in no time.Dori's love for Sumpter Beasts is genuine, and so is her intention to make Mora out of that love.Perhaps the Jinni in Dori's lamp knows this better than everyone else. The spirit was tricked into entering Dori's lamp, but it has never left since.Dori will summon it into combat, but she will also grant its wishes afterwards.Sometimes the Jinni even thinks that the fairy tale might actually have gotten things reversed -For the one who dwells in the lamp is a powerful fighter, while the one holding the lamp is the one who grants wishes.
No one knows how exactly Dori met Alice, but they are truly a pair of business partners that could make all merchants jealous.Alice travels the world, so she does not stay for long every time she visits Sumeru. However, every once in a while, Alice will ask someone to send her new invention to Dori.Dori, for her part, will sell it and find a way to send the Mora to Alice.Sometimes, Alice sends the invention with an attached letter that tells Dori to keep the Mora for the time being because Alice is currently in a dangerous area.However, Dori insists on getting someone to send the Mora to safe zones closest to Alice's position, making sure that Alice will receive the Mora at her earliest convenience.The labor, shipment, insurance... The various costs tend to amount to a fairly large expenditure, but Dori is never stingy in this regard. She even pays in advance."I, Dori, never default on payment.""Also, Ms. Alice has expenses, too. I must make sure that she has Mora at hand whenever she needs it."Dori often repeats these words and, despite the trouble, repeatedly makes sure that Alice's payment is delivered.Though Alice is no longer Dori's only supplier, Alice's payment is still a top priority for Dori.Perhaps it's because Dori keeps a certain promise embedded in her heart - the promise she made to Alice the day they met."You want limitless Mora? Sure. I can supply you with marvelous items of all kinds. But how much Mora you're going to make will depend on how good you are at sales.""Don't worry. I'll sell them for a good price, earn a large sum of Mora, and deliver your share as quickly as possible... I'll be your greatest business partner."
To better enjoy the fascinating clinking of Mora, Dori ordered a custom-made "Mora Music Box."On top of the music box is a slot precisely the size of a single Mora.Insert a Mora through the slot into the box, and it will roll along the intricate tracks inside and make pleasant clinking sounds.These sounds compose beautiful music to which Dori twirls in the grand Palace of Alcazarzaray."Mora, Mora, shining brightly.""Mora, Mora, toward infinity.""Beautiful Mora, Dori's Mora.""Everyone's Mora, come to Dori."Dori's sung this song countless times, yet she's never tired of it.At the end of her dance, Dori takes a deep bow to her imaginary audience.It is also the moment when the Mora falls to the bottom of the music box, making the final clink -With this finishing touch, an imaginary curtain descends upon Dori's delightful dance.However, Dori is never quite finished - she always has another Mora to slot into her music box.
Two girls of similar ages hummed a melody that was slightly out of tune. They spent their innocent childhood hand-in-hand as constant companions.They each picked flowers to decorate the other's hair in spring and walked across creeks barefoot in summer.They slid down the golden sand dunes in autumn and shared a book in the warmth of the winter sunlight.It seemed that such happy times would never come to an end.That is, until the elder sister started coughing blood for no reason. At this time, their home came to be ringed by a great many strange adults.The strangers explained the elder sister's situation in serious tones and with unfathomable jargon before sighing at the dingy little room.The younger sister had no idea what was happening, but she visited her sister every day, and her sister would always say this to her with a bright smile:"It's alright. I just need some rest."Seeing that smile, the innocent younger sister's eyes filled with expectation. She even began looking forward to playing together like they used to.But one day, she saw her sister gripping her chest while telling a story.Then, when her frail form collapsed onto the bed, the younger sister reached out to catch her, only to find that her body was so very light....It was almost as if her sister were a feather, a feather that might drift away to some place far, far away.Later on, the younger sister found a crumpled note.It was a doctor's prescription, with a list of herbs that were desperately scarce - the collectors who had such herbs were few and far between.To purchase those herbs would cost more than tens of millions of Mora, an impossible price for a family that was already struggling to make the ends meet.The elder sister always shook her head with a smile to dismiss her family's insistence on following the prescription. Perhaps she herself could only find the courage to glance at that note in the deep hours of the night - and dare to dream that she might "live."Upon finding out about the note, the younger sister put it into her pocket silently and resolved to save her sister."I must make a lot of Mora.""With enough Mora, my family will never have to smile at me while swallowing their pain, and I will never have to lose anything due to lacking Mora..."Perhaps it was at that moment that the gods looked upon her with mercy.But to an "ambitious" person like her, getting a Vision was just the start.In the countless days and nights that have followed, she has constantly kept herself calm and clear-headed, telling herself:"Conviction alone is not enough. I will work hard for what I desire until the end of my days.""There's nothing that Lord Sangemah Bay cannot achieve."

<title>Lyney/Lore</title>
<text>A genius of a magician famed throughout Fontaine. He moves his audience with a combination of sleight of hand and the gift of the gab. Eloquent, ingenious, and with a mind as hard to fathom as a cat.
Personality
A famed Fontainian magician who possesses great stage presence as well as gift of the gab. Audiences are enthralled by his exquisite skills, and they hang on to his every clever word.
Lyney is a skilled magician who enjoys the showlight. He is, at first sight, very easygoing and friendly compared to his siblings Lynette and Freminet, who are reserved and introverted respectively, though he is said to be much quieter when alone with his sister. He and his sister are talented magicians, having learned from Cesar in their youth when they were living on the streets. Lyney remembers all of the people he is indebted to, and will always repay them, such as serving The Knave or clearing Cesar's name from being falsely accused.
Though it is not said directly, we can see he does have some feline traits like his sister such as his eyes, his love for fish and a wish to sleep more in the morning. His tendency to be both intimate yet reserved also gives him a mysterious aura often related to cats. His constellation also has the word "cat" in it, just like Lynette. However, he does not seem to share her ears, tail and enhanced senses of hearing, smell and taste.
He cares greatly for his siblings, wanting to ensure that they have a home to live in and looks out for them whenever possible, becoming extremely irrational should their safety be threatened. Despite all his cheer, Lyney has a dark and traumatic past with his sister, but they have a very good relationship, likening it to the only truth in a world full of lies and falsehoods. As a result, he is willing to do anything to stay with her. Lyney is also implied to quite "proud", wanting to prove himself without relying on others.
Appearance
Fantasticat
Lyney uses the Medium Male Characters medium male model. He is a young man with violet eyes, pale skin, and short ash blond hair, some locks being pulled back in a small braid on the left side of his head. He also has bangs with a small pinkish red strand on the right, covering almost a quarter of his face. Additionally, he has cat-like eyes thanks to their overall shape and their slit pupils. He also has a dark brown tear-shaped mark on his right cheek.
Official Introduction
Version 1
Lyney: Those flowers in the mirror... who are they for?
Sometimes it distracts with a feint, others it pretends to slip up and reveal a flaw... When things get serious, sleight of hand dazzles more than the magic itself. Can you guess what it is?
With the possible exception of the trials held at the Opera Epiclese, Lyney and Lynette's magic show is without a doubt the best live performance in the Court of Fontaine.
Judgment uses truth to deliver justice. Magic uses facade to reach people's hearts.
Even if the whole audience knows that everything that takes place on stage is simply trickery and deception, they'll still be dazzled when they're brought face to face with a miracle. Long before the magician's elegant curtain call, the thunder of the cheering and applause will be deafening.
On stage, Lyney is a Great Magician in the eyes of all. Off stage, he's a reliable older brother, courteous visitor, and devoted friend.
His every move is a pleasant surprise, every word a reason to smile. His whole being is like an indecipherable enigma that you just can't help trying to solve.
If you suddenly find yourself so close to him that you're confiding your innermost thoughts, don't be too surprised.
After all, what is a magician if not an expert in stealing hearts?
Version 2
Lyney: Those flowers in the mirror... who are they for?
In the end, a child must grow up, and they must surpass their parents. Only thus may a family flourish. When that day comes... I look forward to hearing what 'family' means to him.
Magic is a lie. Nothing but evasion, deception, and trickery.
Even a single illusion requires a series of lies to pull off. To put on a whole magic show, you must win the audience's trust by weaving a seamless facade of ruses and ploys.
Props, lighting, assistants, planning... the stage is set through the help of countless aids, both onstage and off. A magician's performance rests upon so much painstaking effort, yet is also weighed down by the burden of expectation.
As such, a magician's design must be absolutely airtight, and his execution without flaw - even a single slip-up could ruin everything. He must not let his "family" down...
"...The magician's lies must not be exposed."
The first time Lyney stepped onto the stage, he had a mission on his mind as he stood there behind the curtain, muttering "Father's" words under his breath.
"Lyney..." said Lynette as she squeezed her brother's palm unconsciously.
The curtain slowly began to rise, marking the start of their performance. Lyney raised up Lynette's arm and gazed back at her with a determined look in his eyes.
"I'll be alright - because as always, Lynette's by my side."
Character Stories
The people of Fontaine love their tales of mystery. The intricate case setups and unexpected twists and turns are captivating for all.Magic recreates this experience under the converging spotlights. For the price of a ticket and some of your free time, you can embark on a wondrous journey amidst thunderous applause and astounded cries.If you were to ask around as to which of Fontaine's "guides" is best at setting up such fantastical tours, most fans will tell you that it is Lyney.Suave, romantic, and talented, he performs miracle after miracle with a casual air.In this industry, one needs only a stable of staple tricks to ensure a renowned reputation and comfortable life.However, Lyney's shows always feature some new trick. Some say that he was born into poverty, and the resultant burning hunger for fame and fortune drives his boundless desire to create.In truth, he simply pursues novelty in his capacity as a performer - indeed, he feels that if he cannot put his whole heart into the show, his deep desire to perform cannot be fully satiated.This is why, despite the applause rising to a fever pitch and beyond, he will rarely satisfy the crowd's calls for a reprise of his most well-known tricks. Some devoted fans consider this to be a bit of a shame......And for them, such regret will only continue to increase each time they purchase a ticket and go in to watch his show.
While Lyney first began his journey in magic to fill his stomach, he has continued to perfect his art even after becoming a person of some renown in Fontaine.Magic, after all, has been his benefactor. Not only has it allowed him and his sister to survive, but it has also allowed them to gain the "acknowledgment" that most children, growing up in a loving home, would have received from their parents.Even from an early age, performance was something closely tied to Lyney's life. Each time he would go on stage, Lyney would have the audience whooping and clapping. And yet, he did not lose himself in their adulation - if anything, it often troubled him.If audiences were simply drawn to the spectacle of magic, then who was to say that they wouldn't abandon Lyney's stage as soon as they caught wind of a more enthralling show in town?In other words, just as an audience would be attracted by petals and cards, they would also be pulled away by grander fireworks and crackling gun salutes. What else did magicians have up their sleeves to capture the hearts of their audience, beyond enticing them with ever more grandiose impressions of shock and awe?In all of Lyney's performances afterward, audiences would begin to notice a change - Lyney would add many segments between performances in which he would interact with them.Indeed, this magician seemed without any airs, sharing various fascinating anecdotes about his life, not even minding if the audience should try to guess at the secret behind his tricks.Of course, the sharper wits amongst them would notice that Lyney's tales were not truth, but instead a way to build up the atmosphere, a bedding laid for a greater magic trick to land upon.Yet no one would quibble about these white lies. After all, truth and falsehoods were already inextricable in many parts of the performance - why, even the magician himself could be said to have become a part of the magic.Thus does Lyney sometimes appear near and dear, and other times just out of the reach of his audience, balancing human affinity and magical mystery perfectly in the palm of his hand, his smile leaving the audiences' imaginations free to run wild.No matter how rich or poor, sad or glad the audience member, imagination is the great equalizer, carrying the charm of magic to all.Thus did the mystery and elegance of this magician spread far and wide, with people even opining that his skill at creating an atmosphere is itself as exquisite as magic."Is that so? Well, I'm just trying to invite everyone to take a brief break from reality, that's all."
Lyney's new home was the Hotel Bouffes d'ete, located in a corner of the Court of Fontaine.The place was home to many orphans who shared similar experiences with him and his sister. The people here helped each other like a family would, greeting the fallout and consequences of those tragic years together.But the siblings, even with a recommendation from the manager of the Hotel, did not find it all that easy to fit in, nor was it easy for the children there to immediately accept these new "outsiders."And in this environment, oppressive in its gloom, the water pumping equipment broke while Lynette was using it, right before everyone's eyes, deepening the distrust to the extreme.Lyney could only step up and take responsibility, agreeing to fix the equipment so as not to affect everyone's daily lives.In truth, he did not know all that much about repair work, but given Lynette's propensity for damaging various small devices, he had long gotten used to following his intuition to do some fixes here and there.Unfortunately, he underestimated the complexity of the pumping equipment and difficulty of fixing it. While he succeeded in restoring it to normal operations, he remained at a complete loss as to whether he had solved the root problem or not, he could not tell.But just as he was at his wit's end, a seemingly reticent young fellow stepped forth, examined, and restored the facilities, even expressing his apologies.As it turned out, he was the one in charge of maintenance at the Hotel, and as he saw it, Lynette had been the unfortunate victim of his failure to detect and replace the aging components in the system in a timely manner.Lyney, for his part, was far more impressed by the young fellow's skills than any talk of responsibility. He wanted to learn from the youth - if nothing else, this would make helping Lynette all the easier.The youth was, for his part, no good at refusing, and thus did Lyney become his assistant in the Hotel's small workroom - and over time, he and this Freminet would become friends.Lyney would prove unselfish in spending time on other Hotel residents, whether it be Freminet or others, but he would keep them company in comforting silence rather than ask them about their experiences.In this he was guided by Lynette's succinct life advice: "No one needs self-satisfied concern."In time, the residents became more willing to share some of their pasts with him, and Lyney would thus become better able to help them with their issues.Freminet was somewhat perplexed by this, believing that Lyney, who was slowly becoming the core around which the Hotel spun, did not need to go this far.Lyney joked that he had helped Freminet when they first met because he knew that his sister would cause further machine-related troubles down the line, and he was uncomfortable with that.But at this point, there was no fooling Freminet with such words. Under his attentive gaze, Lyney could only tell him the truth."Because Lynette's my one and only family, I've learned from her how one should treat all members of their family."
On the Hotel Bouffes d'ete's Founding Day, all the children were abustle, draping festive colors all over the place.To the residents, outside festivals and events were cold and emotionless things, foreign elements in their lives, and only this dwelling could bring them true warmth.Everyone worked in concert to execute Lyney's plan. Lynette had purchased large amounts of festive ornaments, and together with the other children, she strung up colored streamers and hung handwritten festive greetings.Freminet was ensuring that the magical props would operate properly - Lyney had faith in his craftsmanship, so much so that Freminet was completely entrusted with all the magic props this time.Lyney himself was the busiest of all - not only did he have to ascertain everyone's progress, but he was also laying the final groundwork for a grand, unique magic trick in secret.And thus was the banquet successfully held with everyone's support. The children danced to the joyous music playing from the grand hall's phonograph and enjoyed delicious food - this was the birthday of no one in particular, but this was the day they all felt they had gained new lives.The finale, of course, was Lyney, Lynette, and Freminet's Founding Day magic show. The magic box was at the center of the room, and all waited with bated breath.To preserve the secret behind the magic trick, even Lynette and Freminet knew not what was within. But as the room darkened and all eyes turned to Lyney, standing as he was in front of the box, even the highly-experienced magician showed some rare signs of trepidation."Now, you might consider the following words an exaggeration, but the "present" I am about to present to you all is, without doubt, the most important one we have received in our lives."The paper firecrackers burst, and the once-empty box suddenly opened by itself. The crowd cheered, amazed - then fell suddenly into stunned silence.What stood onstage was no present - nay, this was the Hotel's manager, its owner, and their "Father."Her image was one of unsmiling dignity, and thus, though she did not come by often, no one dared to horse around whenever she was around.Surely, Lyney had gone completely mad to have her make her appearance in such a frivolous way.Yet, upon seeing the crowd's reaction, "Father" did not snap at anyone, opining merely that Lyney had kept this secret perfectly, just as a magic show should, declaring it worthy of praise.That night, the children and their "Father" delighted in the various desserts together, and she personally sliced a serving of cake for each of them, which she herself enjoyed some of as well.Perhaps the most amazing aspect of Lyney's Founding Day magic show was its ability to have even "Father" lay down her heavy burden and enjoy a brief moment of familial love.
Magic and secrets piled up at Lyney's feet, growing ever taller like a tower. Gazing down from the top at the people as they passed by in the world below, Lyney knew there was no going back.Both the dazzling sleights of hand and the missions he would come to receive from Hotel Bouffes d'ete had made a habitual liar out of him.And while lies could sometimes be useful for seizing an advantage, they were more often employed to keep more people from being dragged into trouble.Lyney knew very well that once trust had collapsed, the scales of judgment would no longer remain impartial, and even noble goals would become twisted and thought of as evil.As such, not revealing more than was absolutely necessary was prudent when working with others. More often than not, this makes things go more smoothly, with everyone getting the results they want.But lies will not simply scatter on the wind, and Lyney must maintain this illusion with utmost care, all the while keeping his distance from those affected.As so the tower extended towards the skies, until there would be no one to take his hand if he reached out, and even their visages blurred in his eyes.Falsehood was Lyney's constant and only companion on the path that he walked, and this road was long and lonely - this he was always clear-minded about.Everyone knew the brilliant "Great Magician Lyney," but they loved only the mystery, the romance, the unattainable nature. They knew no love for the heart that lay deeper within.He felt he had no right to pour out his mind to others, and yet he must carry on with gritted teeth, for the price of a fall from such heights was more than he could bear.Having played too many parts, even Lyney would sometimes find himself questioning who "he" really was.His dreams often took him back to the tower, where his resting place at the pinnacle vantage would grow smaller and smaller, and with the fog of death they called "betrayal" extending all around, there was nowhere for him to go.But just before he could plummet, a hand grabbed onto him - and from it, he felt a familiar warmth that drew his soul back into his body, steadying "him" within himself once more."Thank you, Lynette..."The awakening youth mumbled to himself.
While Hotel Bouffes d'ete's operations in Fontaine work toward a just cause, its methods can often be radical. Only the influence of "Father" and her control over the inner workings of the Court of Fontaine prevent any serious incidents from occurring.There was once an official funded by Lyney who served in the Maison Gardiennage. This person provided both intel in support of the Hotel's operations and scrubbed clean the effects of some of the Hotel's clandestine actions.These were actions that came with no small risk, but the official always performed them well, for he believed that the Fontaine of the present day needed someone like "Father" who could bypass the many layers of laws and regulations and take direct action.Lyney once joked to him: "I'll be there if you ever need help, and if you're in danger, I'll come to rescue you... Well, don't expect too much of that last bit. Just stay on guard, alright?"The official knew that this was Lyney's way of expressing concern, of course. Yet even words spoken in jest could prove prophetic later, and so they did - this official's deeds were eventually discovered, and on the brink of capture, he used an emergency communication device to send a message to Lyney.Upon discovering the device, the Gardes who arrived at the scene mocked the official's naivete, claiming that the signal sent merely informed his compatriots to save themselves - no one would be stupid enough to try to save him.The official's reply was also quite simple - even such an ending would have been fine for him, for he did not believe that his prior cooperation was the wrong decision.But just as the Gardes were about to arrest the official, thick smoke began billowing forth from dispensers pre-planted nearby, and the official caught sight of a brilliant blaze-The next moment, he was in the drink in the Fleuve Cendre, and was rescued by Freminet.It was said that the Gardes spent a great deal of time chasing after the skyborne flame-trail, believing that the criminal must have used some flying machine to flee the scene, only to discover later naught but wood dressed in clothes, affixed to a glider.In truth, Lyney had earlier used this device to draw the Gardes' attention away before getting the official out of his predicament.The official admitted that he had not had high hopes when pressing the device. Magicians were untrustworthy, after all - but still, he had chosen to gamble on that tiny chance."Haha. Well, it is indeed a gamble to place your trust in others.""But don't worry. Magicians might be full of hot air, but we will never betray the expectations of our audience."
There is a special entity amongst the cats adopted by Lyney and Lynette, and its name is "Rosseland."Every cat in the Hotel has its own territory, but Rosseland has a special affinity for Lyney's hat.A hat is a magician's most important prop, and each time Lyney must use it, he must first chase Rosseland out - a difficult affair when its displeased meows in response are so heartrending, especially to siblings like Lyney and Lynette, who themselves once struggled to find a home.Thus the siblings began their search for a replacement, only to be met by refusal each time, no matter how lovely the new home - indeed, Rosseland would not even give them a second glance.Lyney even specially commissioned an identical hat, thinking that this might put an end to the cat's choosiness, only for Rosseland to lay claim that new hat also, becoming aggrieved no matter which was whisked away.But this was no feline tyranny. Indeed, Rosseland's requests were not terribly excessive. After much thought, Lyney eventually came up with a solution - to incorporate the cat into his magic shows.He and Lynette constructed a little puppet inside the hat that would normally serve as Rosseland's cushion. During performances, Rosseland would burrow inside the puppet, causing it to jink this way and that in a mischievous and adorable manner.And as it turned out, Rosseland was not at all shy - indeed, it greatly enjoyed its new job. Perhaps the spotlight brought it much enjoyment indeed, for it would never prove quite so predisposed to exclusive ownership again, even when it had to temporarily leave its nest when off-stage.During one of his shows, Lyney once made a rare error, having left a card he needed to produce on-stage backstage.With all eyes on him, he had mere seconds to think of a way to save the situation while maintaining his easy-going demeanor.But to his surprise, there was an unexpected weight in his hovering hat - it should have been empty, but Rosseland had somehow found its way inside.Out came the puppet, and out with it came the card Lyney had needed, to the instantaneous applause of all. Lyney heaved a sigh of relief, but he was also quite shocked, in truth.Some thought was put into this matter - but Lyney could only conclude that Rosseland had, influenced by the twins as it was, also mastered the art of the magical performance somehow.
After Lynette gained the favor of the gods, the missions she had to undertake grew more dangerous and difficult.Only Vision-wielders like Lynette could fulfill the most dangerous missions while remaining completely anonymous, and the twins began to operate separately more often as a result.Lyney found himself unable to adapt to this. Not only had the siblings been together since childhood, but he knew that he was not the only one who felt disturbed by this split.He still desired to be beside her, lending her all the help he could - this was his non-negotiable desire.Knowing his desire for power was no longer pure, Lyney concluded that he had become undeserving of divine favor. Yet he still desired a means to bridge the vast gulf in strength between him and his sister, which he did not possess. Unless...To this end, he solemnly sought out "Father," expressing his belief that he needed the mysterious and perilous might of a Delusion to operate alongside his sister."Father" was silent for a long while, till at last two slanted crosses pinned him in place with a wrath rarely shown to the children of the Hotel, her gaze seeming to pierce his very soul."And would Lynette want you to do this?"Her simple yet powerful question cut through the strings that bound his heart, and in a daze, his sister's words once more reverberated in his ears."No one needs self-satisfied concern."Lyney did not need to ask his sister to know that she would never accept his desire to stay by her side with the use of a Delusion. It was only then that he realized the absurdity of his wish."Father" stood up and left, but not before reminding him that this was not the first time he had lacked power, but that he had found an answer before.Lyney would lock himself in his room, trying to digest the reasoning behind the words "Father" had left him with. When he and his sister had been out on the streets, the answer he had found then had been "magic." What, then, would the answer be now?Lyney found the dossiers for all the missions Lynette had taken up during this period, carefully analyzing the process of each one and modeling his sister's every action.Was it really necessary to pass through this dangerous valley to get close to a target?Was it really a must to leap into such a swift river to flee the scene?No, this was just the Vision's light covering her.Thus did Lyney start to make comprehensive plans for his sister's missions, using his understanding of her to design the most suitable routes, make the most practical tools, and choose the best rendezvous points.The trust between them did not change. The look in Lynette's eyes when she left was no longer so strained, and they often embraced heartily and happily when meeting at the rendezvous point.The pure desire to protect one's family would not be moved, gods' favor or no.But even the best laid plans of mice and men may go awry. After conducting dozens of successful missions, the children of the Hotel were caught up in a betrayal, and as a result, Lynette's movements were exposed.Before the siblings was a towering cliff, just like the night when Lynette had gained her Vision - but this time, it was Lyney's turn to reverse their fortunes in a moment of crisis.He opened his emergency paraglider, and grabbing her, threw himself off the edge. But their pursuers followed, raining gunfire down on them.Lyney twisted this way and that, avoiding many a shot, but still the glider was punctured in several spots. Unable to maintain balance, they began to plummet downward towards the embrace of the ground below.Still, Lyney grit his teeth and refused to despair - should fate itself conspire to refute the answer he had come up with to protect his family, he would defy it to the end.Their pursuers began to snicker, knowing that a fall at such speeds would be fatal - only to have a flame light up the skies, pushing the stricken glider toward a fast-flowing river nearby.The power of Pyro changed the direction of their fall, while Anemo defended them from harm - and thus did the twin lights intertwine and spread under the moonlight, fading slowly like the applause that fills the stage during a curtain call.Lyney did not guess at the meaning of the shining Vision he saw in his hand. The answer was, after all, no longer important.

Lore
Watatsumi Island got its name from the phrase "the god of the oceans" from Watatsumi's ancient language.Coral Branch of a Distant Sea It was created by Orobashi after the Archon War.The Subterranean Trials of Drake and Serpent The giant corals found at the island were coral branches that were broken off from Orobashi's body. These corals were later used as a ladder by the people of Enkanomiya to rise to the surface.Jade Branch of a Distant Sea The people of Enkanomiya became the ancestors of the people of Watatsumi.  Under the leadership of the Sangonomiya Clan, they worship the Watatsumi Omikami ja=海祇大御神 instead of the Raiden Shogun.Official Genshin Impact Website:
The Sangonomiya Shrine is located at the center of this island, surrounded by a canopy of mountains and waterfalls. The distance from the capital city has allowed the residents of this island to develop its own unique culture and customs, and as such, many Inazumans outside of this island are well aware of the poor relationship they have with the Shogun and her government - due to the island's lack of natural resources, Orobashi invaded the rest of the Inazuman archipelago, though this was actually due to it being sentenced to death by the Heavenly Principles for learning forbidden knowledge. The ensuing war resulted in Orobashi's death, and while the war ended with the Sangonomiya Clan pursuing peace, tensions between the two islands remained relatively high.
When the Vision Hunt Decree enacted, it has driven hostility between the Sangonomiya Clan and the followers of the Raiden Shogun, particularly the Tenryou Commission, to an all-time high, and the Watatsumi Army has risen up in opposition to the decree. Following the abolishment of the Vision Hunt Decree, Kujou Sara met with Sangonomiya Kokomi to begin negotiations on returning the island to Shogunate rule. The negotiations made some progress, though following the discovery of instability in the Shogun's Army with the Fatui, talks were temporarily halted and the island retained its army to maintain peacekeeping efforts.New Beginning
Holy Soil
According to legends, the depths of Enkanomiya attempts to absorb the spirit of Watatsumi Island, which causes the soil to bleach and erode, and, if left unchecked, will turn the island into a desert. To prevent this, a ritual called the Watatsumi Mitama Omatsuri is conducted regularly. A Bloodbranch Coral Jade Coral Branch from Enkanomiya is required to conduct the ritual. After the events of the Three Realms Gateway Offering, Kokomi decides to find a new way to counteract the Holy Soil phenomenon as to no longer disturb the vishaps.

<title>Whopperflower</title>
<text>sort and add new location images, some images need to crop to square
A bizarre mimetic plant monster that harnesses the elements in combat.These plants lurk under the surface and ambush unsuspecting prey. With the passage of years, sufficient nutrition, and the right environment, it could even take root somewhere and Regisvines grow into a giant tree that sways and spews elemental power... Adventurer Handbook
Whopperflowers are dangerous plants that can be found all over Teyvat. Whopperflowers often disguise themselves as Sweet Flowers, Mints or Small Lamp Grasses in the wild, ambushing the player if they try to pick up the fake plant.
Whopperflowers possess higher than average RES to all damage types. In combat, they use aggressive elemental attacks and can burrow underground to quickly reposition. They will also periodically generate an elemental Shield Enemy shield while charging up and unleash a special attack if the shield is not destroyed in time. If the shield is destroyed, they will instead become paralyzed with reduced RES.

Disguised Whopperflowers
In some areas, rather than a Whopperflower wandering around, it may appear as a harvestable plant. If this plant is collected, elemental particles will appear in the surrounding area before the Whopperflower bursts from the ground, dealing elemental AoE damage in the process.
* Sparkles: Any standard collectible plant will glitter, signifying that it's a collectible item. A disguised Whopperflower never glitters.
* Elemental Vision: Any standard collectible plant will show a white silhouette like the player character or non-elemental enemies when viewed in Elemental Vision. The disguised Whopperflower doesn't have that white silhouette.
*  Icon: Any typical collectible plant will show with its unique icon when the collect option pops up once the player is near enough. For the disguised Whopperflower, a dialogue bubble appears instead of an icon, similar to when talking to an NPC.
* Seed Dispensary: When carrying the Seed Dispensary, disguised Whopperflowers will not show up as collectable seeds, setting them apart from real plants.
* Glow: This only works at night on Whopperflowers disguised as Small Lamp Grasses; regular small lamp grass will always glow a faint blue, the disguised ones don't.
* Quick Pickup: Tapping to pick up all nearby items at once (on mobile platforms) will not "pick up" disguised Whopperflowers, and they will stay in the ground.
* All Schemes to Know: Nahida's utility passive On All Things Meditated, which allows All Schemes to Know to pick up harvestable items, will not "pick up" disguised Whopperflowers.
*Groups: Disguised Whopperflowers are most commonly found around groups of real plants. When finding an unusually large amount of identical plants in one place, it's safe to assume one of them is a disguised Whopperflower.

<title>Shiruyeh</title>
<text>Shiruyeh, also known by his alias Khorramdin, was a historical figure in the Great Red Sand and Desert of Hadramaveth in Sumeru. He was the son of Parvezravan and Shirin of Gurabad, as well as the grandson of the Jinn-Mother Liloupar. His actions and death led to the fall of Gurabad, as the final part of Liloupar's vengeance against her lover Ormazd.
Profile
Long before his birth, Shiruyeh's existence and fate was already part of Liloupar's machinations against her lover, Ormazd, for becoming an ordinary tyrant after uniting the desert peoples. Prophesied to surpass his father Parvezravan, he was thusly banished from Gurabad after he reached adulthood and was forced to disguise himself with a brass mask. Liloupar then lent him her aid in gathering the displaced and starving commoners and former slaves, who had lost their way of life to the Jinn-powered machines that Parvezravan had introduced to Gurabad.Memories of Gurabad
Story
Shiruyeh was the son of Parvezravan and Shirin, the rulers of Gurabad. Before his birth, his grandmother Liloupar prophesized that he would be "an ill omen upon the king's land." Parvezravan, unaware that this was all part of Liloupar's machinations against Gurabad, was terrified of this warning and eventually banished his son from the city, forcing Shiruyeh to hide his face with a brass mask. Liloupar goaded and aided Shiruyeh's plans to take the throne from his father, fostering support for him - who had taken on the alias of the "brass-masked Khorramdin" - among the downtrodden commoners who were facing an increasing socioeconomic gap as a result of the Jinn machines Parvezravan used to replace their labor.
Shiruyeh was depicted by his supporters as the emissary of Nabu Malikata, the Goddess of Flowers, and worship of her became widespread amongst the Brass Mask rebellion. As a result, worship of her became outlawed entirely in an unsuccessful attempt to curb the mounting sentiment.Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, Primal Obelisk Wadi Al-Majuj Wadi Al-Majuj
Usurpation and Shiruyeh's Plague
Shiruyeh's movement gained traction and despite attempts by Parvezravan to curb the mounting sentiment, it eventually gained enough strength to launch a rebellion against Parvezravan's rule. Although the details surrounding the conflict have been muddled with the passage of time, Liloupar used the power of the Abyss in her vengeance against Gurabad; this caused Parvezravan to become a dark monster, and although Shiruyeh and his forces technically won the war, the entirety of Gurabad was struck by a plague and sank into the earth. Most of Gurabad's inhabitants were swallowed up by the darkness or otherwise disappeared, including Shiruyeh and Shirin.The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin According to 'The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin', the people of Gurabad were "scattered amidst a world of darkness, left to become wild creatures who had lost their language and faces."The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin
Legacy
An unknown amount of time after the fall of Gurabad and King Deshret's punishment on Liloupar, Shiruyeh's "rightful heir" Kavusbay returned from exile to take the throne. It is unknown what happened to Kavusbay, but it is likely that Ramshahr - who is the focus of the rest of that Vaguely-Readable Inscription - usurped him.
Over the course of time, Shiruyeh came to be despised as a short-lived despot who led the great city of Gurabad to its ruin, becoming the namesake of the plague which devastated the once-glorious city. Some Eremite tribes believe the name Shiruyeh means "One who is ridiculous and despicable," and it is branded onto the foreheads of exiled chiefs as a form of mockery.</text>

<title>Typeface</title>
<text>'Genshin Impact' uses various typefaces and fonts throughout the game and official media. This page serves to aggregate and elaborate on specific typefaces in use throughout multiple facets of the game.
Main Typeface
The primary typeface of 'Genshin Impact', seen as the font which is used to display virtually everything in-game, is a proprietary typeface tweaked by miHoYo which is based on Hanyi WenHei zh=汉仪文黑 zh_rm=Hànyí Wénhēi in Font Weight 85W weight (Extra Bold), or HYWenHei-85W, a font developed by Chinese professional font design company Hanyi Fonts (Beijing Hanyi Innovation Technology Co., Ltd.), a well-known Chinese font design studio.
By default, the font HYWenHei-85W supports 6763 Simplified Chinese character glyphs from the GB2312-80 character set standard of the People's Republic of China, 6763 Traditional Chinese character glyphs from the GB12345-90 character set standard of the People's Republic of China, as well as 9169 other characters commonly used on the Internet (including Japanese Kana characters); the in-game font contains all of them. Apart from glyphs mentioned above, some Chinese characters glyphs which follow the style of Hanyi WenHei may be designed by miHoYo or may have been contracted by miHoYo; other glyphs which do not but are included in the in-game font are directly from Microsoft YaHei zh=微软雅黑 zh_rm=Wēiruǎn Yǎhēi Bold.
The font has either been modified or contracted to be modified by miHoYo, with modifications such as Japanese-style display of Chinese characters when the game language is set to Japanese, halfwidth interpuncts displayed as fullwidth, and many other modifications. Some Japanese Shinjitai Chinese character glyphs not used in Chinese, such as 図, are absent in HYWenHei-85W but are present in miHoYo's version with the same styling as the rest of the font, suggesting that miHoYo may have contracted Hanyi Fonts to design these proprietary glyphs for them.
Additionally, the Latin and Cyrillic fonts used in the typeface are separate from HYWenHei-85W and may be designed by miHoYo or may have been contracted by miHoYo. HYWenHei-85W natively supports Latin characters, but these are not used by the game and a separate Latin typeface is employed.
Korean characters are not natively supported by HYWenHei-85W, however miHoYo's font includes them. Most of the Korean glyphs are from Nanum Gothic Extrabold; other glyphs that are not included in the original font may have been composed, designed or contracted by miHoYo.</text>

<title>Masanori</title>
<text>the deceased character the NPC Nameless
Masanori ja=公義 ja_rm=Masanori was an Inazuman who is mentioned in the Family Letter, Tattered Letter and by Matsudaira.
Profile
Masanori, along with Nameless Kenji Kazumichi, were children from an unnamed Inazuman village that practiced in the art of the sword. Despite being ridiculed, Masanori did not heed them and both continued to be friends as they grew, eventually joining the Shogun's Army and joining the Tenryou Commission to fight against the Watatsumi Army. Due to his training with Kenji, the two men were promoted to the rank of Hatamoto.
Like many other Tenryou soldiers, Masanori was instilled with loyalty to the Shogun's rule and that the rebels had sealed their fate by opposing her. During a battle against the resistance, Masanori killed a rebel soldier, searched the corpse and discovered a bloodied letter on them. He was horrified to realize that the slain rebel was a senior of theirs at the village and began doubting the war's cause. He had intended to return the letter to the senior's family, but other Tenryou soldiers somehow learned of it and began treating him like a traitor, speaking behind his back and intentionally trying to get him killed on the battlefield.
As a result, Masanori opted to desert the Shogun's Army and joined the Resistance to atone for his sins, writing another Tattered Letter letter to Kenji in the hope that they could reconcile after the war ended. However, Masanori was killed in another battle, presumably by Kenji. His death drew Kenji insane and he too deserted the Shogun's Army, becoming a Kairagi known as "Nameless." Nameless was troubled by Masanori's death and sought the aid of the Traveler to help regain his memories, eventually coming to believe that Masanori was his own name.</text>

<title>Rosaria/Lore</title>
<text>Rosaria, a sister in Mondstadt's Church of Favonius.A sister of the church, though you wouldn't know it if it weren't for her attire. An unusual woman with sharp, piercing words and a cold manner.Her movements are unpredictable. She often leaves without notifying anyone. She acts with some kind of purpose, but others don't seem to know exactly what she stands for...
Personality
A sister of the church, though you wouldn't know it if it weren't for her attire. Known for her sharp, cold words and manner, she often works alone.
Rosaria is a somewhat intimidating woman who has a rather unorthodox idea of piety. Kaeya describes her as someone who is "honest with herself". She dislikes topics that bore her and having to work overtime. Fischl overheard her cursing out someone in Barbatos' name and takes it as a sign of Rosaria's piety, an interpretation Oz doubts. Like Fischl, her intuition is very keen, as she's well aware that Diluc, Kaeya, Venti and Albedo are more than what they appear to be.
Despite her position in the church, Rosaria is the least devout; she is always guaranteed to skip all church activities when possible and the first one to leave if she is forced to attend.Rosaria's  Character Stories Character Stories While she does recite prayers, she does not remember Barbatos' name due to her lack of devotion, frequently mispronouncing his name.
Secretly, she acts as a purveyor of justice for the Church, investigating potential threats to Mondstadt and eliminating them if necessary. She is particularly skilled in killing, having been taught by her former "family", a group of bandits before they had been wiped out by the Knights of Favonius. Due to being offered a chance for redemption by Grand Master Varka, Rosaria sees herself differently to the people of Mondstadt, and is indebted to them for their unselfish warmth and goodwill.Rosaria: Indenture
Appearance
Executor's Thorns To the Church's Free Spirit
Rosaria uses the Tall Female Characters tall female model. She has ghostly pale gray skin, pale magenta eyes with narrow white pupils, and choppy wine-colored hair cut short in the back with a shoulder-length fringe and some strands of her bangs colored a darker red.
As she is always seen with her coif on, which is dark red on the inner surface, the soft contrast with her hair color can lead the player at first glance to assume that her hair is much longer at the back than it actually is.
Official Introduction
Rosaria:Light creates shadow, but shadow will not be controlled by light
Where did Rosaria go off to this time...? Oh, has anyone seen her? There's choir practice today. Deacon Dahlia told me I must ask her to come!
A sister in Mondstadt's Church of Favonius.
At a glance, she appears to be a usual member of the clergy, but after observing her behavior, you would find she is anything but.
Her reverence for the gods is less than that of even the average citizen of Mondstadt, and she never participates in the activities of the Church.
Rosaria is an unusual loner who is a sister of the Church in name only.
But don't forget that wherever light may reach, there will also be shadow.
Character Stories
Rosaria is one of the sisters of Mondstadt's Church of Favonius.Though she is just as much a woman of the cloth as the likes of Barbara and Jilliana, people tend to make a mental distinction between Rosaria and other members of the clergy.While she might dress the part - at least, to a certain extent - her speech and actions do not reflect her office in the slightest.Furthermore, she displays even less reverence towards the gods than the ordinary citizens, and she routinely skips her various church engagements.She comes, goes, and acts in solitude, and if she were ever to make an appearance in the Cathedral, it would be to smoke in the rearmost pew.Such a lone wolf is Rosaria that perhaps she should be considered a clergywoman in name only.
If Rosaria has been lectured once, she has been lectured a thousand times before concerning her unorthodox behavior.For some reason, however, she has never faced any serious consequences for her transgressions. She does not work together with her church colleagues and only rarely shows up to celebratory events in the city.The strange and mysterious Rosaria moves about almost like a wisp of black smoke - blink, and you'll miss her as she disappears into thin air.Her social interactions are never more than superficial, and the rest of the time she keeps herself to herself.However, Sister Victoria would say that the ever good-natured Barbara is one person who has always made the effort to get close to Rosaria."Please don't smoke in the Cathedral..." "Could you try to attend the ceremony on time next time...?""And... Hey, come back, I'm still talking to you!"Barbara is forever anxiously chasing after Rosaria, urging her to complete her various daily tasks.Yet even when faced with Barbara, the beloved idol of Mondstadt, Rosaria remains completely unmoved.Surely her heart can't be completely made of stone?
Rosaria's movements are unpredictable. She often leaves without notifying anyone and can be gone for up to several days on end.During these times, none of her church colleagues know where to find her.One of the sisters who took it upon herself to observe Rosaria once groused that "even a stray cat should at least give you notice before running off..."Rosaria uses these disappearances to do work that only she can do in corners unseen by others.An unfamiliar merchant, a suspicious traveler - are these people threats to Mondstadt?She investigates, shadows, and if necessary, interrogates.If they must disappear, then Rosaria shall be the last person they meet.Such dark work, which cannot see the light of day, is to be done by her hand alone.She always sets out after the sun has set, finishing her work in one fell swoop. Sometimes, if she makes it back by the crack of dawn, she gets to usher in the day ahead with a glass of breakfast wine.The people of Mondstadt live in the golden sunlight, but Rosaria dwells under the silver moonlight.It is a cold, piercing light... just like that of the ice she forms with her Cryo abilities."There are some things that young people need not know," Rosaria thinks.Though, in her eyes, "young people" means all citizens of Mondstadt who live in the light of the sun, regardless of their age.
Like a puff of smoke, the lackadaisical Rosaria is impossible to pin down.Nevertheless, once she takes on a job, she can be relied on to handle it with the utmost professionalism."Lazy" is the last word that anyone would use to describe her ruthless interrogations of suspicious individuals.She also possesses exceptional strength and knows the weaknesses of the human body like the back of her hand - and has no reservations about using this knowledge to kill.People know her as the lazy, chain-smoking sister, but behind the scenes, she is a formidable purveyor of justice.A strange fate for one who ostensibly basks in the light of the gods.What led her to become a blood-soaked slayer? Why does she stay silent while others praise the gods for their protection?Perhaps it should come as no surprise that Rosaria was not born and bred in Mondstadt."A city that is fortunate enough to be boring always needs someone to do the dirty work..."Rosaria stubs her cigarette out as she speaks in her characteristically languid manner."And as far as I'm concerned, the things I deal with are far simpler than living the life of a traditional sister."
Rosaria may not be one to attend prayer meetings, but that does not mean she doesn't have her own theological viewpoints.In her view, freedom is the spiritual pillar of Mondstadt's people, and it is the very thing that caused her to end up here in the first place.Rosaria was born in a remote mountain village, but was taken from her home shortly after birth by the very same bandits who drenched it in blood.Raised by those crooks, she learned how to fight, sometimes thieving, other times doing odd jobs for the crew.She was their servant, but also their tool, a crook, yet still a child.She fought against outsiders and her comrades alike, and growing up was a constant battle for survival against the hunger and cold.Rosaria's youth was just like Mondstadt's sunset - blood-red from horizon to horizon, and so fleeting that night had fallen before she'd had the chance to stop and take in the view.Ultimately, the bandit crew was wiped out by the Knights of Favonius. As their youngest member, Rosaria was judged to have a chance of rehabilitation.Grand Master Varka brought her to Mondstadt. Sincerely hoping that she might someday fit in here, he advised her:"Go to the Cathedral and be cleansed by the light of our archon. You still have the chance to turn your fate around and live a normal life."But Varka had not counted on Rosaria constantly skipping classes and dodging hymnal.She would rather hunt in the wild than settle into a life of dutiful service as a sister. As far as she was concerned, the golden sunlight was not so much cleansing as blinding.For Rosaria had long since come to understand that she was a child of the moonlight, and it was inevitable that she would someday return to the embrace of darkness.
Rosaria, the Church's number one truant, became infamous for her absence very early on."Miss Rosaria, please, show a little more circumspection in your actions! You are a member of the Church. How is it appropriate that you simply never turn up for hymn practice?""Please calm down, Sister Ophila. Miss Rosaria, I'm told that you have never attended a single one of your compulsory classes. Is that so?""Yes.""Mother Maria, please look at this... Rosaria's theological essay is an utter mess!""Miss Rosaria, if I may ask frankly... do you intend to do any work at all here at the Church?""No. I've already found other work."Rosaria never showed so much as a hint of anxiety in any of these exchanges. What's more, it was true - she had indeed found other work for herself, and much darker work at that.The unexpected twist was that she would ultimately end up doing this work under the aegis of the Church.Rosaria the novice did not leave the clergy, but instead became Sister Rosaria without much incident.Nevertheless, when she's not on a mission, she does everything she can to avoid attending church activities, instead heading to the taverns to drink or scaling the city walls to view the scenery.And when she simply cannot escape a church engagement, you can be sure that she will be the first to leave.The instant the workday is done, Rosaria vanishes.Whether by bright day or dark night, there is one principle that she will never transgress: no overtime.
A journal with a white cover. The words "Church of Favonius" are inscribed on the cover.The handwriting is beautiful, but the content is the most of the most banal variety imaginable."Dandelion Wine - now eighty percent off!""Fisherman's Toast - an incredible flavor at an unbelievable price!""Crazy discounts on Wheat - ask at the counter and we'll grind it into Flour for you.""Buy three Tomatoes and get one free!""Fresh Small Lamp Grass! Use it to light up your bathroom! Come on, Sir, have a look!"There is something incongruous about a random assortment of marketplace cries and advertising slogans having been penned by such a graceful and elegant hand.This journal is a relic from Rosaria's novice days.Clearly, she must have skipped class and headed to the rooftops on the merchant street, bathing in the sun, listening to the eclectic cries of the street vendors, and committing them to paper.
Rosaria's Vision came to her on a particularly frigid night.Things were getting desperate for the bandit gang - people were starving and the food supplies were dwindling.Never able to eat her fill, Rosaria was driven by hunger to flee into the freezing wind rather than continue another second with the hard labor she was forced to endure.One of the elders of the gang pursued her and brought her back.He was the very person who had taken her from the village of her birth, and the one who had taught her how to kill."Fleeing makes you a traitor, and traitors can only earn their freedom through victory in combat."The old bandit tossed Rosaria an old dagger."Well, come on then! Kill me, and you can leave this place. I'm long in the tooth now, while you've got youth on your side. You can do this, can't ya?"No one thought that she would be able to kill him - and yet, the old lion would indeed fall by the newborn cub's claws.Thus did the bandits lose an old member and welcome a new one that very night.The bandits were reluctant to accept Rosaria at first since she had slain one of their own, but they quickly had a change of heart after seeing the Vision in her hand.Surely, a Vision wielder had to be far stronger than some old coot who was about to kick the bucket right? And she ate less, to boot... They could save some food this way.Meanwhile, a question crept into Rosaria's frozen heart:Did he let me replace him on purpose? ...Could a false father have harbored genuine affection for a child he stole so arbitrarily?

<title>Wind Glider</title>
<text>Wind Gliders are the primary tool that players use for Gliding in mid-air through open terrain in 'Genshin Impact'. Wind Gliders can be changed for each individual Character in the Dressing Room. This customization is purely aesthetic and has no impact on gameplay.
Usage
Gliding
While gliding is another stamina-consuming activity, it does not cost as much stamina as sprinting, and is comparable to that of regular swimming. The utilization of gliders varies - often, deploying the glider can negate user Fall Damage from any height (unless the player opts out of gliding in mid-air). Gliders are also used to be able to reach high areas that neither normally jumping or climbing would achieve.
Story
The Wind Glider was invented 2600 years ago by a retired adventurer named Leonard. Leonard had previously attempted to scale a great mountain named Pilos Peak, but failed, and created the Wind Glider to help other explorers succeed in their endeavors.Where Ancient Stars Align Once, a man from Sumeru named Firnas (not to be confused with the present Firnas) realized that Wind Gliders did not follow the laws of physics, and that they relied on the blessing of the Anemo Archon to function. He attempted to construct a Wind Glider that worked through physical laws alone, but it is said that after an encounter with the Dendro Archon in his dreams, Firnas came to accept that the gods' blessings are also part of the world's laws.Wings of the Forest
When the Traveler first enters the city of Mondstadt and heads up to the fountain area, they are greeted with the unlocking of the wind glider by Amber. A short quick-time tutorial is given to the player to help them learn the controls of a glider.
It is not until the quest 'Glide With the Wind', that Amber tells the player they cannot glide (in Mondstadt, at least) without a gliding license. Regardless if the quest is done or not, however, it does not restrict the player from using a glider in any area of the game.

<title>Eduardo Baker</title>
<text>Eduardo Baker was a historical figure and the outlaw leader of Fleuve Cendre before the cataclysm. He is the father of Jakob.Fleuve Cendre Ferryman
Profile
Eduardo is a Fontaine figure and a prominent figure in Fleuve Cendre before the cataclysm 500 years ago. He used to operate taverns in Fleuve Cendre, where the Parsifal the Great and her younger sister Josephine performed when they were just starting their careers.The First Great Magic
Eduardo and his wife had their child Jakob born in Fleuve Cendre, in the underground of Court of Fontaine. Initially, Eduardo protected the residents of Fleuve Cendre, using a bronze pipe to defeat the "richly nutritious water" and countless "livestock," such as crocodiles. He also protected the merchants from getting extorted, harassed, and blackmailed by the gangs, resolving the disputes between Fleuve Cendre "compatriots", and blessing the newly wedded. Eduardo became an outlaw leader who maintained order in Fleuve Cendre, gathering numerous followers. He once declared, "Let all that the sun shines upon belong to them, and let the Fleuve Cendre belong to us."
Eduardo was among those arrested resisting the purge of the Fleuve Cendre, and while being escorted to exile in the Great Red Sand desert. He was rescued by his henchmen. Banding together with comrades active near Mont Automnequi, they occupied Poisson, and seizing the members of the Maison Gardiennage charged with transporting them as hostages, they made a series of unreasonable demands. Parsifal, or possibly Josephine, who portrayed "Parsifal", also joined Eduardo's resistance group.Before the situation deteriorated further, Karl Ingold took a photograph of Eduardo, Jakob, the current mayor of Poisson Renault de Petrichor and his son Rene de Petrichor, "Parsifal", Rosa Reed and her husband Thompson with their infant, and Tom Alter.
Eduardo presumably died during the Siege of Poisson.Interactable: Institute of Natural Philosophy Ancient Notes Ancient NotesRene's Investigation NotesAs the Khvarena's Light Shows Eduardo's son Jakob and Renault's son Rene were sent to the Narzissenkreuz Institute.

<title>Raiden Shogun/Lore</title>
<text>The Raiden Shogun is the awesome and terrible power of thunder incarnate, the exalted ruler of the Inazuma Shogunate.
With the might of lightning at her disposal, she commits herself to the solitary pursuit of eternity.
Personality
Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, who promised the people of Inazuma an unchanging Eternity.
The Raiden Shogun is a firm believer of what she believes to be eternity - a place in which everything is kept the same, regardless of what goes on. She is honorable in her conduct and is revered by the people of Inazuma.
The Raiden Shogun exists in two forms - Ei, her true identity, and the Shogun, a puppet created by Ei to oversee Inazuma in her stead while she meditates in the Plane of Euthymia. This puppet follows a set of directives programmed into her, which are extremely difficult to modify. The Shogun is cold and stern in personality, even callous at times; she is limited in emotional expression, has no likes and dislikes, and has no need for recreation.To Traverse the Mortal Plane The Shogun thinks of herself as Ei's assistantThe Lonesome Euthymia and carries out her creator's exact will, unable to act on her own volition. If her usual functions are disabled, the Shogun becomes ineffectual. Due to limited protocols as a result of Ei's initial indifference towards anything other than "eternity", the puppet is able to be manipulated by external influences. For example, the Kujou Clan and Fatui persuaded her into initiating and maintaining the Vision Hunt Decree.
While Ei has a more stern demeanor than the average person, she is notably more emotive and sociable than the Shogun. Unlike the Shogun, Ei has preferences, such as a love for sweets and passion of martial arts. Due to her dedication to eternity, Ei maintains a wary attitude on the idea of change. However, she demonstrates curiosity rather than disdain towards new affairs, such as the appearance of the TravelerThe Servant's Path and the customs of the modern world. Due to having lost many of her loved ones over the centuries, Ei is driven by a fear of further loss, wanting to preserve Inazuma. To this end, she previously sealed herself in the Plane of Euthymia to keep herself from the effects of erosion. She created the puppet Shogun to ensure immunity from the decay of her physical body. While in the Plane of Euthymia, Ei was indifferent to anything that did not affect her pursuit of eternity and had a low opinion of human ambition due to it resulting in loss and suffering. Thus, making it incompatible with eternity.The Omnipresent God While in the Plane of Euthymia, she was not unmoved by loneliness, as Ei is shown enjoying Yae Miko and the Traveler's company.
In spite of her flawed actions, Ei is devoted to Inazuma, simply longing to protect it and her people. After she is convinced that her actions were destructive, Ei shows remorse and is willing to change her perspective regarding eternity to become a better ruler. She also gained a newfound respect for the idea of human ambition and its achievements.
Appearance
Narukami's Law
The Raiden Shogun uses the Tall Female Characters tall female model. She has pale skin, purple eyes with light blue pupils, and long, dark violet hair that becomes lighter at the ends, which glow when she uses her Elemental Skill or her Elemental Burst. She also has a beauty mark below her right eye.
Official Introduction
Her Excellency seeks to rid herself of the mundane delusions of the world, but only in an attempt to overcome the cycle of life and death. No one truly understands her, yet she does not deign to make herself understood... Her Excellency the Shogun is simply full of contradictions.
The undisputed supreme ruler of Inazuma.
Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, promised the people of Inazuma an unchanging eternity to last throughout the ages.
After purging all sentiment with merciless lightning, the solitude of her mind became a secluded space free from mortal joys and woes...
Over the long years, the road to eternity has been dark and desolate, but Her Excellency the Shogun has never wavered, not even for a moment.
For true unchanging eternity is found only in the stillness that manifests itself when all noise is stripped away.
Character Stories
Since the dawn of life, humankind has always borne an intense yearning for and curiosity about the world. This is the anchor point of their cognition and is the foundation of all reason.The world of the people of Inazuma is also thus. There, thunder, lightning, wind, and rain were primordial facts of life, as well as light, and the sea... and the Raiden Shogun.Babes nestling in their mothers' arms hear tales of the Shogun's slaying of many gods and conquering of other races.When young men and women roam the islands, they see the gorge split asunder by a blade of lightning and the pale, still-standing bones of the Orobashi giant snake.Soldiers take to the battlefield with "glory to the Shogun and her everlasting reign!" upon their lips.The people work in contentment and peace, knowing that the Shogun and her loyal Tri-Commission are there.The great name of the Raiden Shogun has long shaken off the shackles of mere life, becoming the eternal traditional belief of Inazuma.People trust in this great name and its might, believing that their descendants shall witness the same sights, that the same faith will form the foundations of their inner worlds, and that this will pass on from generation to generation.This is the eternal paradise that the Almighty Shogun promised her people.
The true name of the Raiden Shogun is "Raiden Ei."In her long road, she has witnessed the price that Inazuma has had to pay for progress over the hundreds and thousands of years.The happiest years of her life had passed her by, and those she once considered friends became her foes. In the end, she even lost the reason for which she had wielded her sword."Where there is progress, there must be loss."Ei believed that this was the iron-clad rule of the world, with time as its merciless enforcer.Khaenri'ah The greatest and most prosperous nation of men collapsed overnight, and even that most ancient Liyue Harbor would say farewell to its Rex Lapis Geo Archon. The winds of parting came whistling in from the outer edge of time.However resounding the Raiden Shogun's name, centuries later, millennia later... Someday, Inazuma would lose the protection of its deity.As a warrior, she was wary of all foes. Even if that enemy was a crisis as intangible as time's passage, she had to find a countermeasure, a weapon she could use to defeat it in time.Her answer? "Eternity." Only Eternity could freeze all things under the sky, make Inazuma truly deathless."Then, while things are still good, let us have stillness... Let us march towards Eternity."
For beings with a perishable form of flesh to pursue Eternity, they must first solve the unavoidable problem of lifespan.This limited time troubled Ei greatly, until one day when a mysterious technique came before her eyes as if by a stroke of fate.Using such techniques, one could create intricate puppets indistinguishable from true life.In theory, this puppet could perfectly imitate everything about Ei. It could surpass the limits of her lifespan and defend Inazuma forever. Yet, how could creating a copy of an Archon be a simple affair?Ei conducted Scaramouche countless experiments to this effect, discarded a great many failed products, and spent an unimaginable amount of time and resources-But at last, by her dogged pursuit and warrior's spirit, she was able to create a flawless puppet.The newborn The Shogun Raiden Shogun sat there silently, listening to Ei speak all about her, "her," and even about them. The future of Inazuma was here, inscribed upon a gorgeous blueprint.The automaton had but one question to ask Ei: "There is no turning back from forsaking your form. Do you regret nothing?""Your existence is my answer."Then, Ei transferred her consciousness into her blade, and thus was born the Plane of Euthymia.
Before Raiden Ei became the Shogun, she was a samurai responsible for seeing that the previous Shogun's orders were carried out.The previous Electro Archon, Raiden Makoto, was no great fighter, and the things Ei had charge over were mostly matters of warfare and slaughter. However, Ei also had moments of repose away from battle, sitting with her friends under the sakura trees and playing karuta.Due to her character, Ei was always the most wooden player. She was never the final victor, nor did she ever have a taste of the prizes that the Kitsune Saiguu reserved for the winners.Thus, she poured the effort that she put into swordsmanship into karuta practice, often pestering Makoto or Mikoshi Chiyo to karuta matches, or spending much time by moonlight reading the poetry inscribed on the cards out loud.At last, the day came that under the sakura trees, Ei would defeat opponent after opponent. Even the mighty tengu would be felled after a hard-fought battle, and thus was she crowned the champion.Ei let out a victorious whoop at her victory, only to be greeted by the sounds of her friends' laughter. Only then did she realize that she had lost her usual composure entirely, before snapping both arms back down and reverting to her usual cool facade. Of course, her friends did not intend to make sport of her. Indeed, they understood her character and the manner in which she had worked ever so hard to come out on top.As for the Kitsune Saiguu, oh, how amused she looked as she presented Ei with some pastries."I said it was a reward, yes, but it was simply some hand-made cakes of mine. I didn't think that you would be so concerned about it, Ei. Well then, enjoy the spoils of your victory to your heart's content."Ei was hardly one to be greedy for snacks. But as a samurai, she firmly believed that what she lost must be reclaimed. These pastries were more akin to a vindication of her desire to win.-But it was not long before that cool demeanor of hers broke into a smile again. The cakes were lovely - just like the taste of victory. As for her clumsy attempts to hide that smile, one could only say that it was an entertaining sight all around for her friends.To this day, Ei still often remembers that sakura tree....Even though she has not gone to see it in a long time, and even though no one sits under it anymore, she wishes that time might stop forever.
Ei still remembers the way in which Makoto greatly loved the scenery of Inazuma, its cuisine, and the stories of its people - and how she loved telling Ei all about it.Though they both understood the concept of erosion well, Makoto was unlike Ei, who worried about the future more often. Instead, Makoto's energies were focused on the present."It is precisely because we know that this scene is but a fleeting shadow that we should enjoy it all the more."Then, Ei could only smile wryly, realizing that she, the kagemusha, was even more old-fashioned than the real Raiden Shogun. She thought to herself that she must learn to be more leisurely, just like Makoto.Yet the times changed all too quickly, all but catching Ei off guard. Before she knew it, her hands already held the blade that the dying Raiden Makoto had passed on to her.This day, the kagemusha was now the true Raiden Shogun.And it was on this day that Ei truly felt the agony of erosion.As time marched forward inexorably, even this blade, this sakura... All life on Inazuma would fade before her eyes.This was the foundation of Inazuma, and it was the thing that the Raiden Shogun must defend."If you look at it this way, thinking ahead is not meaningless, nor is it vain arrogance."Having resolved herself, her life exceeded its mortal shell, and eternity descended upon the mortal plane.
One night, Raiden Ei entered a beautiful dreamscape while meditating.Here, there was nothing left between heaven and earth but her, and a "The Shogun her" that was akin to looking into a mirror.The automaton's voice flowed into her ears like a sigh: "the eternity you resolved to establish in your heart has been shaken by the countless wishes of the people. Thus, you have become my enemy."Back when she was creating the puppet, Ei had considered all the hidden risks involved.She believed that anything was possible - including the worst-case scenario... in which she too would someday become a threat to Eternity.But she had to press on. She had to reach Eternity. This, she would not permit to be stayed by any outside force.The puppet's words were something that she had asked herself long ago:"You believe that you are more firmly convicted now than you were yesterday, and that is why you are presently correct. Is that so?""Do you presently have some new ideas, or have you, too, fallen victim to inexorable 'erosion'?"Their faces were the same, but they spoke of different ideals. Farewell to the Past The battle with herself, with her past, would come someday.But it was not this day. Ei knew well that she was not yet ready.Her heart was clear, and she would have remained in that state, but hearing the cries of her people, she had to command her feet to stop.The sky above the mirror was no longer empty, and all about the silent halls, she heard the cry of crows. Dawn was coming. The samurai must take up her sword.This dream was ever so real, and it, too, passed like a shadow.
A sword that, once passed on, has accompanied Ei to this day.This sword has had two wielders, and has witnessed both time and eternity.It was born from Raiden Makoto's divine might, but it was never once sharpened. It took after its owner, of course, for Makoto was not one for battle. It was but a symbol, a sign of true peace.The day Makoto passed on, it was given into Ei's hands. The sword was stained with blood, then, and as the blade drew its first taste of crimson, the dripping ichor was blown aside by wild winds and blazing thunder.Makoto gave it the name Musou Isshin, and desired to have it witness an Inazuma as lovely as a dream and the noble hearts that dwell in this world.Ei did not change its name. For she, too, had looked out over that vast scene of beauty, and the sight of it had engendered a stronger, purer dream in her own heart.The aesthetic of lightning is precisely to capture that which is precious amidst fleeting transience.
Before she came to dwell in the Plane of Euthymia permanently, Ei was troubled for a time concerning where she might store her Gnosis.She no longer had any need of it, but such an important item could not simply be placed anywhere. She had initially intended to have it modified into a energy supply device, but no matter what she did, her techniques had no effect on the Gnosis at all.And that was when she thought of someone: the cunning and clever Yae Miko. She was not precisely someone to be trusted, but she was in many ways also Ei's best choice.Upon hearing this request, Miko could not help but joke: "Aren't you afraid that I might just sell this off?""You understand the value of a Gnosis. Even if you sold it, I trust that you would have exchanged it for something of equal value, and that is no easy price to pay."With someone of Yae Miko's character, it would be no surprise if she ever sold the Gnosis, yes, but she would not allow herself to lose out in any such exchange.Such, then, was the tacit agreement between the two old friends. Yae Miko understood Ei's intent and took the precious Gnosis with a smile."Well, this is your idea, not mine. Don't end up regretting this, now."

<title>Traveler's Sibling</title>
<text>The Traveler's Sibling is the lost twin sibling of the Traveler and the prince/princess of the Abyss Order. The primary goal for the Traveler in 'Genshin Impact' is to find and reunite with their sibling - traveling throughout Teyvat, obtaining information about them from meeting with members of The Seven.
The gender and name of the sibling depend on the player's choice at the beginning of the game during their fight against the Unknown God. If the player chooses male, the lost sibling is a female named Lumine; if the player chooses female, the lost sibling is a male named Aether.
Appearance
The physical appearance of the sibling is very similar to the Traveler's. Both have slim figures, f=blonde hair, golden-yellow eyes, and very pale skin. Lumine's hair is a bob cut with shoulder-length, straight twin-tails; while Aether's is medium cut with a long braid.
Lumine wears a pale white sleeveless dress with blue lines and tail capes, with gloves covering her thumbs. Also, she wears white stockings and boots; Aether wears a dark breastplate vest and black boots, with dark brown pants, a white scarf and a two-tailed cape with golden embroidery and decals.
Certain parts of the Traveler's clothing light up based on the current element they are attuned to. In the opening cutscene, both siblings are seen with glowing white clothing and yellow wings. However, though they retain their glowing white clothes, the sibling has yet to show use of any of the several elements in or out of combat.
In the We Will Be Reunited, the Sibling is shown wielding the same Traveler's Original Sword white-gold sword as in the opening cutscene, but it now glows with dark energy.
Personality
We will be reunited, dear brother. But not here, not now. We will meet at this journey's end... Once the dust has settled. Then you will understand.|Lumine
The sibling has a vendetta against the divine after finishing their journey across Teyvat for reasons unknown. They are solely devoted to accomplishing the goals of the Abyss Order regardless of what has to be done to do so. Despite their questionable actions, the sibling still cares for the Traveler, as they express a desire to return home with them after finishing their goals and convinces them to continue their journey across Teyvat to witness the truth themselves rather than forcing their views on them.
Story
The twins initially fall to Teyvat while traveling between various worlds after their home world was destroyed. They crash-land and fall unconscious from the meteoric impact.Sword of Descension
The Traveler's sibling is the first to awaken, and leaves the yet unconscious Traveler to head to Khaenri'ah.The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call They eventually became seen as a source of hope and strength by the Khaenri'ahn people. Five hundred years before the beginning of Genshin Impact, the sibling witnesses the cataclysmYouTube:  and the Gods destroying Khaenri'ah. They rush back to the site where they had crashed and wake up The Traveler, showing them the destruction being wrought.
During the beginning cutscene in 'Genshin Impact', both siblings are fighting against the Unknown God. Depending on which gender the player chooses, they will have a name attached to them and will become the Traveler. The other sibling (Lumine or Aether) is then attacked by the Unknown God and sealed away in a cube. The Traveler continues to fight, but is subdued and has their powers sealed away. They wander the land until they come across Paimon.YouTube:
At some point after the cataclysm, the Traveler's sibling woke up and traveled the world of Teyvat with Dainsleif. Near the end of their journey, their sibling realized the "truth of this world" and parted ways with Dainsleif for reasons unknown.
During the Archon Quest, Prologue Chapter - Act III, intelligence passed on from Kaeya and background history from Venti reveals that the Abyss Order had recently gained a new leader named the Prince or Princess.When the Wind Dies DownEnding Note At this point, while the Traveler does not know who this leader is, the player can conclude that the Prince or Princess is the Traveler's sibling.Reunion With the Dragon
In the story teaser trailer , the Traveler's sibling is depicted as Lumine. In it, she is shown traveling through Mondstadt carried by a Ruin Guard and is revealed to be the mastermind behind the Abyssal plot to weaponize the dragon Dvalin. An Abyss Mage refers to her as "Your Highness" and proceeds to tell her about their foiled plan - she is shocked to learn from the Mage that her brother had a major role in foiling their plot. Later, she runs to a cliffside, where she watches her brother fight hilichurls in the grounds of Stormterror's Lair, unbeknownst to him. This same area is revisited by the Traveler and Dainsleif during the Bough Keeper: Dainsleif, where the Traveler senses the presence of their sibling in the past through the dandelion they had stepped on centuries ago. It is later revealed that the sibling was once Dainsleif's travel partner, and the two parted ways for reasons unknown.In the Depths, an Unexpected Reunion
At some point in the past, the sibling encountered the Aranara race of Sumeru and helped them repair the Varuna Contraption. In thanks, the Aranara named them "Nara Varuna." Before parting with the Aranara, "Varuna" told Araja of another golden-haired human who would visit them in the future and give them even better memories.Aranyaka
In the We Will Be Reunited, the Traveler's sibling briefly meets with the Traveler in front of the Defiled Statue after an altercation between the Traveler and an Abyss Heralds Abyss Herald. There, the sibling asks the Traveler not to stop them or the Abyss. They also reveal the truth of Dainsleif's origins and that the monsters of the Abyss were once the people of Khaenri'ah that had been transformed by a curse. The Traveler tries to persuade them to leave Teyvat and continue their journey together; the sibling agrees to this, but only after their war against the divine is over. The sibling then tells the Traveler to continue traveling Teyvat ,in the hopes that they, too, would eventually see the true nature of the world presided over by the Seven and Celestia. They then leave with the Herald through a portal.
At some point, the sibling visited The Chasm: Underground Mines The Chasm and saw many dead hilichurls who had wandered inside the cavern. There, they discovered a pool of water which repressed the effects of the curse; the hilichurls had been attracted to the water and had gone there to die in peace. Angered and upset by their needless suffering, the sibling authorized the activation of a device that would supposedly amplify the water's effects to the point that the curse would be removed for good, regardless of how likely the plan would be to succeed. If the device worked, the hilichurls would be reverted to their previous forms as humans of Khaenri'ah, but if it failed, it would inflict extreme, needless pain on the hilichurls. The device backfired and it was destroyed by Halfdan with the help of Dainsleif and the Traveler.
In the Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises, Nahida told the Traveler that while Irminsul and the Fatui considers them a Descender, their sibling was not considered a Descender. This is because Irminsul has records of the sibling, which, according to Nahida, would be impossible unless they belonged to Teyvat. This also contradicts what the Traveler remembers, since they had both come from a world beyond Teyvat according to their memories. Furthermore, while Irminsul has records of the sibling's sudden appearance in Khaenri'ah and their journey through the seven nations of Teyvat, the records suddenly "become fuzzy" near the end of their journey. Nahida concludes that somebody is deliberately obfuscating the sibling's fate from Irminsul for unknown reasons.A Toast to Victory
In the Inversion of Genesis, Scaramouche claims that Pierro The Jester had lived with the Traveler's sibling for a period of time, when he had served as the royal mage of Khaenri'ah. He also claims that the Jester had told him the Traveler's sibling's only came to Teyvat because "the heavens responded to the summoning."
In the Caribert, it is revealed that the sibling had once encountered Chlothar Alberich and witnessed the effects of the gods' curse on the people of Khaenri'ah through Chlothar's son, Caribert, who had been transformed into a hilichurl. After using the Abyssal power imbued into him by the Voice Inside the Head Sinner, Chlothar was able to temporarily reverse the curse and bring Caribert back to sentience. However, Caribert eventually took off his mask and "an immense energy"—the power of the Abyss—knocked the sibling out. When they came to, Chlothar addressed them as the Prince/Princess of Khaenri'ah, who controlled the Abyss and who the Khaenri'ahns once believed would bring "new strength and hope" to their nation.page=Portended Fate This initially unnerved them—however, over the course of their travels with Dainsleif, they realized that Chlothar had been right all along and joined the Abyss Order as their current leader.

<title>Collei/Lore</title>
<text>A Trainee Forest Ranger who is under the tutelage of Tighnari. She started her academic career a little later than her peers, so she is currently working hard to catch up.She hides the other side of her personality deep under the surface of optimism and kindness.
History
Collei was born sickly, so her worried parents brought her to a Barnabas seer and begged him to save her. He explained the illness as being "touched by the deev" - supernatural creatures with negative properties - and claimed that had to give their daughter to him in order to save her. However, he was working with the Fatui Harbinger Il Dottore and instead of saving her, turned Collei into a test subject for their Archon Residue experiments.
Whether the Fatui had let Collei go or if she had escaped herself is unknown, but she eventually found herself wandering alone. On account of her sickliness, she was treated poorly wherever she went; she was often abused by passing pedestrians, had stones thrown at, and pushed around. This fueled her hatred for people and gods, and a strong desire for vengeance.
The disease Collei is afflicted with is called Eleazar. Unique to Sumeru, this is a disorder that causes dark and hardened scales to form on the body. First symptoms are mild numbness on the affected areas of the skin, but as the disease progresses symptoms of general fatigue and peripheral paresthesia (abnormal sensation of the skin on the limbs) may occur. The final stage of this disease causes complete paralysis of the afflicted person, rendering them completely immobile. These symptoms hint that Eleazar might be a neurological disease. This condition is what causes Collei to be perceived as "clumsy" by other people, as it affects her ability to hold or carry objects, often dropping them to the ground. According to Tighnari, there is no cure for Eleazar, only preventive care may be provided to stop the disease from advancing to a more serious stage. In the days Collei spent with the Fatui, Dottore was able to keep the disease controlled by unknown methods.
Upon the removal of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's consciousness from Irminsul, Collei and the other Eleazar patients have recovered.
Personality
A trainee ranger active in Avidya Forest. Behind her enthusiastic words and actions hides a slightly introverted personality.
When Collei first arrives in Mondstadt, she is extremely wary and suspicious of people because of her past experiences, preferring to be left alone and making her seem cold. Her pessimistic view of the world comes from the mistreatment and abuse she endured everywhere. She also has a rather low opinion of herself, pushing people away because she is "unclean" and says she is unworthy of their time.
She was initially annoyed by Amber because of her cheerful and optimistic personality, but Amber shows her kindness by offering to help her find that something she lost, even insisting they are friends and protecting her from Kaeya's intimidation multiple times. The two continue to grow closer during the course of the manga and Collei begins to trust Amber, becoming less wary of people as her view of the world becomes brighter.
When Amber protected Collei from Barnabas, Collei was touched by Amber's resolve and realizes that she too wishes to be able to protect others. After having her powers sealed by Cyno, she decides to leave with him to Sumeru in hopes of learning more about the world.
By the time she meets the Traveler, Collei is shown to have matured whilst training under Tighnari and is now considerably more positive. She expresses great admiration for Amber, whose compassion deeply moved Collei to the degree that it influenced her behavior and hobbies. Inspired by Amber's benevolence, Collei tries to be very helpful and proactive in her Forest Rangers Forest Ranger duties and strives to be as friendly as possible to everyone. Although she still has struggles with her literacy and Eleazar, she attempts to discard her past pessimism in favor of pushing forward and doing the best she can regardless.
She also developed a deep sense of empathy, extending even to the gods, whom she used to deem forsaken by, she now wonders if they too can feel just as helpless. She states that looking back, her extended hatred towards the world outside the Fatui was "childish." She also expresses guilt over her time in Mondstadt and is interested in apologizing.
Despite her improved outlook, it is clear that Collei has yet to fully put her trauma behind her. Whilst no longer being bitter about it, Collei still finds it very difficult to open up to others about her past and avoids the subject when possible, as it brings back painful memories. Her introverted nature also leads her to occasionally spend time alone in a tree hollow, where she writes about any troubles or frustrations she may feel.
Collei is somewhat of a bad liar, only being able to convince Amber on why she wanted to know about the Fatui's research. She is also prone to panic attacks and breakdowns, and especially hates being pushed or shoved around. Even just trying to touch her might cause extreme fear and discomfort, as shown when Paimon tried to playfully touch her the day they met for the first time in Sumeru. This shock apparently triggered a flare-up of her disease, causing her to be bedridden the next day.
Appearance
A New Leaf
Collei uses the Medium Female Characters medium female model. She has short, wavy light green hair that reaches her shoulders and purple, almost magenta eyes.
Manga
Collei's hair in the manga was chin-length.
When she first appeared, much of her body and face were covered in bandages. She wore baggy trousers, one that resembles a sirwal, and a tapper hat made from bandages. Tied around her hips is a green-orange cloth. Later, Amber loaned one of her old outfits to Collei to attend Ludi Harpastum in. Collei also wore a beige satchel, in which she store the collected Fatui devices.
In Chapter 16, she appeared with a plain black shirt and a simple pair of shorts under a hooded cloak. She also wore an ushanka hat, a pair of gloves, and boots that reach up to below her knees. Lastly, she uses the same green-orange cloth and beige satchel from earlier.
Official Introduction
Collei: To grow is to conquer the past
Oh, you're going to Sumeru? Can you give my regards to Collei? Well... it's been so long, I wonder if her hair has grown out and if she's taller?
A trainee ranger active in Avidya Forest. Positive and optimistic, enthusiastic and kind.
Collei is from Sumeru, but few people know about her experiences before she came to Gandharva Ville, and she herself never mentions anything about her past.
Perhaps because of Collei's pure gaze and earnest attitude, people saw her reserved demeanor as just part of her personality and did not shy away from her because of it.
The children of Gandharva Ville love to watch her sew dolls, and those who find themselves lost in Avidya Forest are willing to follow her back to safety.
Since her return to Sumeru, Collei has earned the trust and respect of the people with her actions.
But at night, when everything is dark, she sometimes thinks about those memories that she has buried away.
Even though everything is going well, she still hopes that she can work even harder and improve faster in the future.
-Only in this way can she overcome her past weak self as quickly as possible.
Character Stories
"Helpful," "bright and sunny," "friendly and passionate"... Just ask around Gandharva Ville, and you'll hear this Trainee Forest Ranger praised to the skies in such terms.As long as her body allows, no matter how busy school gets, Collei will never slack off when it comes to her forest patrol work, and is always willing to lend a warm helping hand to whoever is in trouble, regardless of what walk of life they are from.Nevertheless, even as enthusiastic and positive as she is, there seems to be a past and things on her mind that she is not yet ready to reveal to others.If in the woods where she often patrols, you should chance upon a tree hollow full of strange notes, or hear someone whispering nearby...No matter what you witnessed or overheard, please kindly take a detour and consider it a silly prank - one played by an Aranara, perhaps.After all, there are some things that only a tree hollow can know - for now, anyway.
If words are the vehicles of wisdom, being literate is undoubtedly the starting point of the pursuit of knowledge. Collei, however, seems to have only barely reached the foot of the mountain of knowledge.When she first arrived in Gandharva Ville, even the outspoken Tighnari showed obvious hesitation, making repeated inquiries with the Cyno General Mahamatra if she had walked through the wrong door, since he had yet to make any plans to teach preschool level courses.Still, after several twists and turns, Collei did finally become a trainee. To facilitate her learning of words, Tighnari gathered a wide assortment of books and documents, in the hope that Collei would soon master enough words through extensive reading.Apart from the literacy encyclopedias for children and the mandatory-reading academic papers that made her head swell, Collei can most often be found reading fairy tale picture books from Mondstadt.The logic is simple: those books tend to have fewer words and more pictures. Even if you do not know the words, chances are that you can still guess their meaning by looking at the illustrations.However, reading only children's books hardly sufficed to keep up with her curriculum. Once she had picked up slightly more words, she immediately started to look for new extracurricular reading materials.According to some travelers who had passed through Avidya Forest, there was a type of book in Inazuma known as the "light novel," which was easier to read than academic papers, and with fewer illustrations than picture books. To Collei, that sounded like the exact type of book she needed.More importantly, the plots of these "light novels" were often so incredibly riveting that as soon as they got a copy, many readers just had to finish reading it in one go, even if they had to stay up all night.That definitely sounded tempting to Collei, since she had to force herself, more often than not, to stay awake long enough to finish her readings.One day after her forest patrol, Collei excitedly ran back to her dormitory with the newest volume of "Onibudou." She was so ready to pull an all-nighter reading the light novel - and as it turned out, she indeed stayed awake that night."My sealed power!" "The lonesome avenger!" "You'd be wise to stay away from me!" "I shall never witness the grace of the gods!"...-Covering her head with the quilt, Collei tossed and turned upon her mattress the entire night. Even as the dawn broke, she had not yet torn her mind away from these words.
There is a saying in Teyvat that has obscure origins and is often used by people who are feeling extremely ashamed or embarrassed:"I just wanted the tree to open up and swallow me."Collei was pacing in the woods while murmuring the sentence, which she had just learned from a book.Before she returned to Sumeru, she had promised a dear friend that she would become an excellent doctor with exceptional medical skills so as to save people like her who were in constant agony, both physically and mentally.However, it takes only a passing passion to make a wish, and yet it requires years of painstaking training to realize it. In the examination that had just concluded, Collei had hit the barrier between reality and expectations once more."Ugh... How am I supposed to tell Amber about this..."Plus, she would have to ask her master to write the letter for her. Things like doing poorly on the test and wanting to have someone to talk to were not things she could easily speak out in front of her master, either.It just so happened that a tree hollow, roughly the size of a person, appeared along her patrol route, as if some god had overheard her mumblings."Wait, wait... Talking to Aranara about my problems... I mean, I've read about it in the books, but they were children's books! I'm sure I've outgrown that... But now that there's no one around..."Before she knew it, she was already crouching in said hollow.The darkness turned into a solid fortress, isolating Collei from all kinds of pressure.Collei, being an introvert by nature, found it difficult to present herself impeccably. No matter how hard she strove to be as outgoing and sunny as Amber, she could never manage to ignore her weariness and loneliness.Thus did Collei vent her distress to that hollow, emptying herself of all the negativity she had accumulated after getting back to Sumeru."Did Collei go on patrol in that area again?"A few days later, Tighnari checked on Collei's recent forest patrol routes, which she had been taking all too frequently, before looking at her test papers, which featured remarkably higher scores. He could not help but think to himself:"Did she find a way to improve her grades in the forest? Well, that's not bad either way. Alright, I'll save that patrol route for her and leave her be for the time being. I'll have other Rangers take the other routes."
Should written tests be left out, Collei actually does well on her exams, especially when it comes to "surviving in the wilderness."The jungles of Sumeru suffer no shortage of poisonous creatures and dangerous beasts, while unexpected emergencies lurk around every corner. Therefore, a competent Forest Ranger must be a thoroughly-prepared one.And Collei really exceeds in this regard. She may not be as literate as her peers, which hinders her performance in all the written tests. Yet, she is nothing if not practical and creative.Wrapping thorny vines around her boots to increase traction, rubbing the toxic sap of poisonous mushrooms onto hunting traps to promote efficiency...Such ideas have ensured that she can travel in and out of the jungle safely, successfully extracting those unfortunate enough to become lost in the woods, accidentally ingest poison, or get hit by a running beast.Those who have been rescued by Collei are, one and all, amazed by her unique but reliable survival skills - not to mention how they are all moved by her genuine kindness and enthusiasm.Be it surrounded by grave dangers, or lacking food and supplies, even if the rescued traveler turns hysterical, she embraces every circumstance with the warmth of the sun.She cares little for scars, and hunger concerns her not. She just wants to offer help to whoever is in need.The only thing about her that is considered unacceptable by many is the recipes she utilizes during times of crisis: as long as they can replenish her energy, she will even gladly swallow fireflies without hesitation - the crushed pits of Zaytun Peaches are even less of an obstacle.When people meet her, they simply cannot help but wonder about this young trainee's past.-What sort of experiences could make such a seemingly innocent girl see the wilderness as her home?
Before returning to Sumeru, Collei had wandered for a long time.The decisive difference between wandering and traveling, of course, lies in that the former bears no designated destination.Her wandering started from those charred ruins, or perhaps earlier, when she was afflicted with Eleazar that disease, and it was long destined to be a never-ending nightmare extending into nothing but total darkness.Most of the companions with whom she had fled from the ruins either lost their way in the endless waves of sandstorms, or corroded to death by divine remains.Sick and cursed, they had nowhere to stay, thus turning to uninhabited jungles and wildernesses.Mother Nature is both merciful and cruel. She would never reject them because of their illness, nor would she offer whatever they need even if they cried out for it.As more and more of her companions could walk no further, the lessons they left behind helped the rest become better at surviving in the most desperate situations.And when Collei's last companion could no longer continue, she learned yet another lesson: never to reach out to anyone again.At that time, the two of them had their backs against the cliff, utterly exhausted. Yet, they could still hear the beast roaring from not too far off.Perhaps it was because of the narrow passage, if not for other reasons, but her only remaining companion bumped into her, sending her careening off the cliff.Fortunately, Collei managed to grab a tiny twig in her panic, before stretching out her other hand and shouting for help.However, that companion merely glanced at her with a complicated look before escaping alone without hesitation.She did not get far, the beast's howls outpacing her fleeing steps like a raging wind. The beast's pure predatory instinct caused it to overlook the shivering Collei, who was barely hanging onto the cliff.Collei quietly withdrew her hand and held on tightly to the branch that might break at any moment, until all the sounds above her head died down.The roar of the beast and the screams of that companion had all disappeared.She could not hate that companion. If she were in that person's shoes, she could not guarantee that she would have made a different choice.At that moment, there was only one thought remaining in Collei's mind.Be it to offer help or to ask for it-"I will never reach out to anyone again."
Collei once again touched Amber someone's hand during a certain year's Ludi Harpastum in Mondstadt.The city was elaborately decorated with lights and lanterns. The streets were jam-packed with people. The sky was getting darker, and the stage was in full swing.A girl in flaming red just grabbed her hand, took her out of that cramped wooden box, and squeezed into the crowd.People gathered around, cheering and applauding the contestants who were playing hoops or with slingshots.Collei could not relate to them. No matter how well they could play these most childish games, what use were they in hunting game out in the wild?Yet, the girl with her was extremely passionate about these little games. She would cheer and whoop at every victory, and hand out the prizes she won to the children.Collei was even more baffled. If not for the rewards, why would anyone participate in these activities? Was there really any fun in them?So she sneaked to a corner and picked up a slingshot to try her hand at it - in the end, one of the more than ten shots she fired eventually hit the edge of the target."Yay! I hit it!" Collei turned her head excitedly. "Hey! Did you see..."It was only then that she realized that she had been there for quite a long time and the girl in red had already left.In the days that followed, Collei had been practicing day in and day out. Gradually, she became more than familiar with the sounds of drawing a bowstring and throwing darts. She practiced for a long time, until she would seldom miss a shot out of ten.Every time she pulled the bowstring back, Collei remembered the excitement of hitting the target for the first time on that night.And that when the girl grabbed her hand and ran towards the crowd, her palm was as warm as the sun.
To grow up is to best one's immature past self.Collei often helps the children in Gandharva Ville mend toys, and her Forest Rangers colleagues also occasionally ask her to help patch their clothes when they get torn up by branches.That said, Collei was by no means born a seamstress. As a matter of fact, her first attempt at sewing was nothing short of a disaster.It was when Collei was about to leave Mondstadt. Right before she left, she handed a piece of repaired old clothes to Lisa, hoping that she could return it to its original owner, Amber, on her behalf.The piece was indeed repaired, but also covered in stitches so twisted that one could potentially mistake them for earthworms. In all likelihood, it was no longer possible for its owner to ever wear it out again.She was afraid that Lisa would laugh at her or criticize her.To her surprise, Lisa just gently took Collei's hands, hidden as they had been behind her back, and carefully bandaged the injuries.She was not even slightly surprised by all the injuries, deep or shallow, on Collei's fingertips. She just casually commented, "Why, it almost looks as if someone's been bouncing Wolfhooks across their hands all night, as if they were balls.""Don't be this impatient with your studies in Sumeru, little Collei," Lisa said with a smile. "There's always a first time for everything, and learning to overcome the difficulties you encountered during that first time is where the meaning of growing up lies."Collei instantly blushed. She had not quite learned how to accept the kindness of others back then.But she was just a child, and children grow up.The desperate child would grow up and discover hope once again. A child who could not use a slingshot at all gradually learned how to aim.That child who was once constantly injured by a needle has also slowly grown up to be an ingenious role model in the eyes of other children.In Gandharva Ville, children gather around Collei, chittering with envy and excitement."You're so skillful! What a pretty cat!" "Collei, does it have a name?"Collei, for once, felt so proud of herself. She held up the exquisite cat doll, all fine stitches and perfect needlework."This is - Cuilein-Anbar!"
The rain was pouring. A surge of rock, earth, and debris had blocked Collei's way back.Collei lit a bonfire by the cliff, trying to warm the shivering girl next to her.This river valley would require a full day's journey from the woodlands that were the domain of her usual patrols. If she were here all by herself, it would not be entirely impossible to get back in this rain.But now that she had a child with her, wracked by cold and hunger after being lost in the woods for a long time, she had to wait.The girl looked pale, her forehead boiled, and she kept murmuring her mother's name.Collei still remembered the girl's mother, who had been anxiously and desperately seeking help in Gandharva Ville - she recalled the look on her face, the look of one who wished that she was in suffering instead of her daughter. Collei knew that look.The family had been traveling with a caravan to cross the river valley. As they were camping and resting, her playful daughter had run off, straying into the deep forest. As soon as the caravan noticed that the child was missing, they tried their best searching for her, but it was all in vain.In desperation, the mother had to return to Gandharva Ville to look for help.Recently, Tighnari had been attending meetings in the city with other Forest Rangers, and the situation before her was critical - Collei could not wait for any of them to return. Nor could she rely on the search and rescue dogs during such heavy rain.So she immediately grabbed her pack, bow, and arrows, before diving into the forest alone.At that moment, the occasional low growl against the sound of thunder and rain told her that there were beasts approaching.Collei could not help but recall some disturbing experiences from her past. Old memories came flooding back, the memories she least wanted to face.But the rain would pass, and after receiving the news, Tighnari rushed over without taking any breaks.Traces of fighting could be found all the way along the cliff. Several beasts lay fallen in the distance, while Collei and the girl slept peacefully on each other's shoulders.Tighnari's heart seized up in his chest. He was well aware that Collei was not capable of doing all this - unless she had wielded power that should not be unleashed.It was like drinking poison to quench thirst, and it would surely aggravate Collei's condition. He must contact the General Mahamatra right away...Tighnari's footsteps awakened Collei. She hurriedly gestured to ask her master to quiet down so as not to wake the girl next to her.Tighnari checked upon her worriedly, "Collei... Did you..."Collei shook her head. She raised a hand and released the fist that had been clenched all night."Master, I've become stronger! I won't let anyone's efforts go to waste - from now on, I'll protect everyone."It was a Vision, silently glowing in her hand.

Manga
Collei is a major character in the manga, which takes place roughly a year or less before the Traveler's arrival in Mondstadt.
In search of both a cure for her illness and means of revenge, Collei travels to Mondstadt. Unable to gain entry normally, she initiates the Black Fire Incident as a distraction to slip in to Mondstadt.
Amber finds Collei and befriends her despite Collei's warnings. Amber does her best to help Collei with her search while also investigating the Black Fire Incident, during which Amber discovers the metal birds planted by the Fatui and disables them with Collei before they can cause any harm. Amber also takes Collei to Ludi Harpastum festivities and shows Collei that people lead happy lives in Mondstadt.
Kaeya discovers that Collei is the culprit behind the Black Fire Incident and sets out to kill Collei but is stopped by Collei's acceptance of her death as well as the timely arrival of Amber.
Amber resolves to help Collei even after learning that Collei is the culprit behind the Black Fire Incident. Amber stands guard while Cyno seals away Collei's archon residue.Due to localization adjustments made since the manga's release, this term is no longer accurate. The original term in Chinese refers to gods that predate the rise of The Seven. Afterward, Amber faces Barnabas alone to protect Collei and eventually brings him down with the help of Diluc, who is also posing as the perpetrator of the Black Fire Incident. Kaeya "arrests" Diluc and hands him over to the Fatui to close the case, absolving Collei of the Black Fire Incident.
Afterward, Collei writes a letter to Amber with Lisa's help, thanking Amber and saying she left for Sumeru with Cyno.

<title>Mikoshi Chiyo</title>
<text>Mikoshi Chiyo ja=御 み 輿 こし 千 ち 代 よ ja_rm=Mikoshi Chiyo, also known as Torachiyo ja=虎 とら 千 ち 代 よ ja_rm=Torachiyo, was an oniMask of the Kijin and a member of the Mikoshi Clan who lived around five hundred years ago. She was the biological mother of Iwakura MichihiroEmblem of Severed Fate and the adoptive mother of Mikoshi Nagamasa.Katsuragikiri Nagamasa She was a close ally of the Raiden Shogun, Ei.
Chiyo is depicted alongside the Raiden Shogun, Sasayuri, and the Kitsune Saiguu in . She is the second to disappear from the picnic ground after Ei recollects their battle against each other.
Profile
Chiyo was once a valuable ally of the Raiden Shogun Ei and campaigned with her against the dark forces that emerged during the cataclysm. However, she was swallowed whole by a "beast of sin" and while inside its stomach, was tainted by the darkness. Even though she managed to rip the beast apart and slay it, she was forever changed: she would later turn her blade on Ei, after which she was defeated and badly injured. Her ultimate fate is unknown.
Appearance
She allegedly looked "as lovely as the moon," and was so beautiful that the Kitsune Saiguu wanted to hide her own face behind a mask.Hakushin Ring She is also described as "petite" and "dainty".Redhorn Stonethresher
In , she is depicted with two large horns on her head, red eyes, and long black hair with red highlights. She is wearing her battle-garb: a white Jūnihitoe juunihitoe with red and pink trim and a gold interior. When Ei recollected their battle, Chiyo is shown with glowing red eyes and two glowing red scratches on the left side of her face.
Story
Chiyo was a close ally of Ei and fought against the dark forces of the cataclysm. During one particular battle, she was swallowed whole by a beast with a tiger's body and a snake's tail. While within this "beast of sin," she was "stained by a deep sin" and witnessed her comrades being torn apart by the beast's jaws.
She drew her sword against the Shogun, but her sword-arm and horn were severed. She then fled and disappeared into the forest, with her ultimate fate left unknown: people believe she was slain by either the tengu, the Shuumatsuban, or even the Iwakura Clan. Others claim that she encountered an "oni-masked, sword-bearing doll," likely referring to the Maguu Kenki.

<title>Wanderer's Troupe (Faction)</title>
<text>the faction the artifact set Wanderer's Troupe
The Wanderer's Troupe, also known as the Swordsman's Troupe, was a group of people adept in both music and combat that traveled all over Teyvat a thousand years ago. Their most notable act was their failed rebellion against the Mondstadt Aristocracy, during which its members either met their demise in battle or were punished afterwards, leading to the group's disbandment.
Their story is attested to in the Wanderer's Troupe and Resolution of Sojourner artifact sets, as well as the Wanderer's Troupe Series weapons.
Story
Little is known about the formation of the Wanderer's Troupe. All that is known is that the Conductor and the Sojourner met first, followed by the Dawnlight Swordswoman, and then Kreuzlied.Resolution of Sojourner Whether there were more unnamed members is currently unknown.
The group traveled around Teyvat, even once entering Mare Jivari to perform for their "foes."Wanderer's Troupe Its members similarly came from all over Teyvat, though only the Sojourner and Kreuzlied's nationalities are known; the Sojourner was a famous figure in Fontaine,The Stringless while Kreuzlied was born to Mondstadt's Lawrence Clan but ultimately split from them.The Bell
The Wanderer's Troupe eventually ended their journey in Mondstadt, around the time of Ludi Harpastum. There, the Sojourner fell in love with the maiden chosen to throw the ball at the end of the festival - after which she would be claimed by a member of the tyrannical Lawrence Clan. Unable to tolerate such injustice, the Wanderer's Troupe stormed the city in hopes of overthrowing the aristocracy. They failed, however; the Conductor and Sojourner died in battle, while the Dawnlight was enslaved as a gladiator and Kreuzlied's punishment was left unknown.
While the Wanderer's Troupe has largely been forgotten, the Dawnlight and Kreuzlied both had a major influence on Mondstadt's ultimate liberation from the aristocracy. The Sword Dancer befriended Ragnvindr, then a squire under Mondstadt's knight order, and inspired him to take a stand against the corrupt nobles - he derived his title, the Dawn Knight, from her own moniker, Dawnlight.The FluteBallads of the Squire Meanwhile, Kreuzlied established an underground society aimed at taking down the aristocracy, using it to aid Vennessa when she rebelled.</text>

<title>Joserf</title>
<text>Joserf is Joel's father, who went missing on Dragonspine. The Lost in the Snow revolves around the Traveler's futile search for him.
Joserf becomes a permanent NPC that resides in the Dragonspine Adventurer Camp, along with Joel, regardless whether players completed the Version 2.3 event Shadows Amidst Snowstorms or the Snowy Silhouette: Reunion.
Profile
He said that he would come pick me up and that we'd go watch the snow together. But the time we arranged has come and gone, and he isn't here yet...|Joel
Prior to the game's events, Joserf set off to Dragonspine and left his son Joel at the Adventurer Camp. He promised to Joel that he would return and take him to watch snow together, but the day they arranged for it to happen came and Joserf did not come. Joel, worried and stuck at the camp, asks the Traveler to help him look for his father.
The Traveler's search was unsuccessful and the only trace of Joserf were his written records, the supplies he abandoned, and the presence of a bowl with which he fed several Snow Fox snow foxes. Near the foxes, the Traveler found a buried pit containing a complete set of 3 star Adventurer Artifacts, except for the Adventurer's Pocket Watch. At the end of the cave, there were a group of Hilichurls and a backpack containing Vol.6 of The Boar Princess at the bottom of the mountain, which indicated that Joserf had fallen from the mountain and had been attacked. Although the Traveler doubted Joserf's survival, they tried to sugarcoat the situation after returning to Joel.Lost in the Snow
During the Adventurers' Guild training camp, Reckless Pallad separated from the group to pursue his personal motivations, only to lose his footing and fall down the mountain. He was discovered by Joserf, who brought him to shelter. According to Joserf, he woke up and found himself covered in blood, lost most of his memories by the time he met Pallad, attributing it to head trauma. Joserf had forgotten virtually everything about himself, including his identity and the reason why he was on Dragonspine, but apparently retained his hunting skills and was able to survive alone as a result. Pallad convinced Joserf to follow him to the Adventurer Camp, where they ran into Joel. After Joel recognized him, Joserf began recalling vague details about his past.A Secret Born From AshesSnowy Silhouette: Reunion
While attending the training camp send-off, the Traveler and Paimon meet Joserf. They are surprised by his survival and discover that he has no memories of The Boar Princess or feeding the foxes, but are nonetheless glad to see father and son reunited. Afterwards, Joel and Joserf can be found together in the Adventurers' Camp, where they plan on building a fox-shaped snowman.
Appearance
Joserf and his son look so alike that the Traveler describes him as a "gigantic version of Joel." They share the same brown hair, blue eyes, and even the color scheme of their clothes.

<title>Sumeru/Culture</title>
<text>Under the guidance of Lesser Lord Kusanali, the God of Wisdom, Sumeru's culture primarily revolves around studying and research.
Life in Sumeru
As the nation that houses Sumeru Akademiya, Teyvat's largest known academic center, much of what is known about Sumeru is set in the context of the Akademiya.
People in Sumeru value rationality and wisdom, and the fact that many adults in Sumeru do not have dreams is in fact a source of pride for them. Knowledge was originally managed as a resource through a device known as the Akasha system, which is powered by the Gnosis of the previous Dendro Archon, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.YouTube:  The people of Sumeru frequently used to use their Akasha System Akasha Terminals to find information, and essentially every adult had one; children do not. After the suspension of the Akasha System, the people of Sumeru were now able to dream once more.
While humans are predominant, there are also a few humanoid races living in Sumeru; the only known group so far is Tighnari's kind, known as the Valuka Shuna, who are considered to be a rare sight. The Jinni, a race of spirits from the desert oases, and the Aranara, a race of forest spirits, also live in Sumeru. The Pari, a race of avian flower-like spirits, dwell in the Girdle of the Sands.
Sumeru has both forest and desert. Originally the entire nation was forest, but after the dropping of a Divine Nail, a large amount of the land was terraformed into desert. The desert is said to be a harsh place, an endless expanse of sand, scorching sun and sandstorms. It is filled with ruins from both Khaenri'ah and King Deshret's time. Like Khaenri'ah, King Deshret's civilization was highly advanced for its time, as they had the capability to create Primal Constructs, along with colossal structures such as The Mausoleum of King Deshret and the irrigation system in the present-day Desert of Hadramaveth that are in relatively good condition even after centuries buried beneath the sands.
In the deserts of Sumeru, some Eremites live in tribes. The only tribe the Traveler encounters is the Tanit, which they and Jeht destroyed as a result of Babel's machinations. There are three other known tribes; the Afiyah, who were briefly seen working with Aderfi, and the Uzza and Shimti tribes, which have yet to appear in-game.
Education
Sumeru Akademiya
Education can take an extremely long time at Sumeru Akademiya, despite being renowned across Teyvat. Lisa, the most talented student to attend in two hundred years, managed to graduate in merely two years; most other students are not nearly so lucky.
The unnamed author (most likely Gregor) of a certain message on the Cat's Tail Message Board Chosen by the Sage Cat's Tail Message Board was selected by a sage at the Akademiya and has gone to study there, but expresses regret that his parents will be old by the time he graduates. His message suggests he has recently come of age, putting him around 18 years old; assuming his parents are in their mid-40s to early 50s, this means his education will likely take somewhere around 15 to 20 years. This is corroborated by Hosseini's dialogue, in which he claims he is "not even 30 yet" and that being an undergraduate at his age is not uncommon.
Lisa mentions feeling disillusioned with its workaholic culture, citing it as the reason for why she became so lazy after returning from Sumeru Akademiya.
Cuisine
Sumeru cuisine generally revolves around spicy foods, especially curry. The forests and deserts of Sumeru also contain many edible flowers, mushrooms, fruits and nuts, which are used in their cuisine.
Economy
Knowledge is generally seen as both a measure of wealth and privileges in Sumeru, as there is a thriving black market in the nation for those who wish to acquire Knowledge Capsules, which allow the user to access the knowledge within without prior vetting. Dori and the Eremites are known to sell them to customers, which often consist of researchers from the Akademiya.
Shaggy Sumpter Beasts are also a way to measure wealth in Sumeru, likely due to the prevalent role they play in transporting goods, particularly across harsh areas like deserts.
Port Ormos is Sumeru's main port, where foreigners from other nations come to buy and sell goods.
Other traded goods include crocodile produces, spices and essential oils for beauty products. In the Desert of Hadramaveth, Eremite tribes conduct trade with merchants who proceed to sell the goods in the city, who likewise bring them goods from there.
Designs, Motifs, and Symbols
Character Cards
The overall shape of Sumeru Character Cards is a large circle with a darker crescent covering the upper part of the circle. To either side of the crescent's inner edge are circles with symbols, which varies based on the character's overall affiliation with either Sumeru City or the Desert.
Sumeru City
Those affiliated with Sumeru City have a total of six circles, each with a different design, representing the Sumeru Akademiya The Six Darshans Six Darshans of Sumeru Akademiya:
*Bottom left is a horse with an hourglass, the symbol of Vahumana
*Middle left appears to be a bird - possibly a simurgh, Huma bird huma, or griffin - with a wheat stalk, the symbol of Amurta
*Top left is a lion with an Ionic order Ionic column, the symbol of Kshahrewar
*Top right is an elephant, the symbol of Rtawahist
*Middle right is a tree branching into a peacock, the symbol of Spantamad
*Bottom right is a bull with a scroll, the symbol of Haravatat
Arabesque-like patterns are also prominent in the background, alongside Moroccan trellis patterns (or quatrefoils) which can be seen towards the bottom of the Cards. The trellis is more obvious on the Chinese Character Cards (see ).
Desert
Those affiliated with the desert region of Sumeru have four circles, although the bottom right circle is currently obstructed and cannot be clearly discerned. Clearer views of the image are present on the Japanese Character Cards of Candace and Dehya, but the full image has yet to be shown.
*Bottom left is unclear, but possibly an Ammit (crocodile) head (from the Chinese and Japanese Character Card, it is apparent that the figure lacks pointed ears, which rules out a jackal or Anubis head)
*Top left is a ram's head
*Top right is a bird, most likely either an African sacred ibis or an Egyptian vulture.
The background features hieroglyphic and Ancient Egyptian-inspired designs.
Families and Lineages
In Sumeru, people may derive their surnames from their ancestors. Descendants' surnames will prefix their ancestor's name with Pur fa=پور fa_tl=son zh=普尔; Anisa's full name is Anisa Purbiruni, where "Purbiruni" zh=普尔比鲁尼 is derived from the great sage Biruni who lived 500 years ago.Solitary Sea-Beast Based on the previous example, "Pursina" zh=普尔希娜 may be a surname used by descendants of a woman named Sina.The Persian name 'Sina' is a male name and the Persian polymath Ibn Sina has his name rendered in Chinese as mini=1 zh=伊本·西那 zh_rm=Yīběn Xīnà. However, the 'Sina' zh=希娜 zh_rm=Xīnà in Pursina uses the female-exclusive character mini=1 娜, indicating that Sina was a woman. The Traveler mentions that this practice might not necessarily imply biological descent, but also be a form of admiration for the sages of old and imply following in their footsteps.

Politics
Sumeru Akademiya governs Sumeru and handles much of the daily affairs of the nation. The Grand Sage appears to be the leading figure in the nation, seeing how the previous Grand Sage, Azar, enacted several decrees and negotiated with The Doctor over the creation of an artificial god. If no Grand Sage is present, an acting Grand Sage will be implemented. While the nomination process is unclear, it appears that anyone prominent in the Akademiya can be selected as a Grand Sage; Alhaitham, the Akademiya's Scribe, and Siraj, a rising Vahumana scholar, were both  considered for the position.
The nation does not have any official military force of their own; the Eremites instead serve as an unofficial placeholder, who are mercenaries originating from the desert. They are often hired as bodyguards by the people of Sumeru, mostly researchers but also for important families and other clients. The Corps of Thirty, a large Eremite group, helps maintain peace and order in Sumeru City, Port Ormos and Caravan Ribat.
Eremite tribes in the desert are not affiliated with the Akademiya and are self-governed, usually led by elders and possibly matriarchs. They have their own set of rules that usually revolve around the well-being of the tribe. Violating these rules often incurs harsh punishments, such as exile or death.

<title>Zombie</title>
<text>A zombie is an individual who has been resurrected from the dead.
Currently, two zombies are known:
* Qiqi, who resurrected after being imbued with a large amount of Adeptus adeptal energy.
* Jialiang, who died from a heart condition and was brought back to life by Baizhu through the use of the Elixir of Immortality during The Formula for a Miracle.
Overview
Zombies are made when the corpse of a dead person is reanimated through medical or magical means. Their bodies are typically covered by talismans, which function to sustain their state of suspended animation.
Zombies normally take orders from the person who awakened them, who then becomes their master. However, this is not always the case. Qiqi, who was never awakened by anyone, woke up on her own after being dislodged from the amber that trapped her - and is thus her own master, operating by giving herself orders.Guizhong (Quest) Similarly, Jialiang maintained his sentience after being awakened by Baizhu. This could mean that the person who awakened the zombie can choose to either control it or set it free.
Although they may appear to be a regular, living human at first glance, zombies have cold and stiff bodies due to the onset of rigor mortis. As a result, they are usually forced to move around by hopping. Qiqi circumvents this by performing calisthenics on a daily basis, but reverts to her undead state in combat, which gives her inhuman strength. She also lost her sense of taste after becoming a zombie,No Tomorrow but can still distinguish texture.
Due to her undead nature, Qiqi has an incredibly poor memory; she will forget a person within three days if she does not regularly reinforce her memories of them, and admits to forgetting Baizhu's face regularly. To commit important information to memory, she writes down important information in a notebook. She also speaks monotonously and displays few expressions. However, her wit is not as diminished as it may appear; she has long realized that Baizhu has underlying motives for taking her in, and learned how to hide from Hu Tao as to avoid being buried.
Uniquely, Jialiang maintained his memory and normal speech patterns even after being resurrected as a zombie. It is possible that this is due to the properties of the Elixir of Immortality, which does not involve the use of adeptus arts.</text>

<title>Natlan/Culture</title>
<text>Natlan is characterized by its adherence to "war," the Pyro Archon Murata's ideal.
Life in Natlan
Natlan's people are grouped into tribes, which have different rules.Lectoure During Tenoch's era, which happened prior to the creation of Mare Jivari, there was at least six major tribes in Natlan, though it is unknown how many there are now.Talking Stick Alongside humans, a large number of more younger dragons reside in Natlan, having undergone years of development and evolution, co-existing with humans.Finale
In the past, the clans of Natlan would come together and hold tournaments in Murata's honor. Whether this practice is still held during Vennessa's era or the present is unknown; Vennessa's tribe left Natlan and became nomads, only passing down the art of war to their descendants. As a result, by her time, Vennessa and her people no longer had knowledge about their homeland.
Despite the Traveler never having encountered a single person from Natlan, people are apparently still able to travel in and out of the country; Aikawa Susumu has visited Natlan personally and experienced their hot springs. According to him, Natlan is "a country of red-hot passion, both in name and climate."Aikawa Susumu
Another Inazuman who visited Natlan in his youth is Shousen, who witnessed the nation's art of boxing. He noticed that the locals trained using a method they called "shadow boxing", where boxers would practice sparring by imagining their opponents' actions and reacting accordingly. This technique inspired Inazuma's Shinryuu.Phantom Flow: Phantasmal Blade
"War" is a daily part of life in Natlan, which Neuvillette likens to an "undying flame."
Economy
Natlan's hot springs are renowned throughout Teyvat, with Inazumans taking great interest in it and incorporating it into their culture. Snezhnayans, being technologically savvy, developed a machine that gave an approximation of the hot spring for anyone to enjoy.Mikawa Akane
Technology
By the times of Tenoch and Vennessa, people of Natlan have been using respectively obsidian and metal ores from the region, with the ores of Natlan having a "divine flame" and quality above those of other regions, like Mondstadt.Shackles of the Dandelion Gladiator
Languages
In addition to speaking the Languages Teyvat Language common tongue, it appears that Vennessa's clan had their own language, which was presumably either a Natlan local language or a language derived from theirs, depending on how long ago Vennessa's clan left their homeland.</text>

<title>Charlotte/Lore</title>
<text>Indefatigable reporter of The Steambird, constantly on the hunt for the "truth."
Personality
Indefatigable reporter of The Steambird, constantly on the hunt for the "truth."
Charlotte is extremely devoted to her occupation as a journalist for The Steambird, frequently finding the "best scoop" in the news to share with her readers. This has frequently resulted in her appearing anywhere in an instant if something piques her interest, and sometimes even resulting in her running into danger in the process. Once something gets her interest, she becomes extremely relentless in an attempt to interview them. Charlotte's devotion to finding the best news has made her popular among the Steambird's readers.
Appearance
"All Is Overt Through My Lens"
Charlotte uses the Medium Female Characters medium female model. She has a pale complexion, bright turquoise eyes, and salmon pink colored shoulder-length hair.
Official Introduction
Charlotte: Your credible source of the unbelievable truth!
...Euphrasie, three days ago, one of your journalists secretly followed a suspect all the way from the Court of Fontaine to Romaritime Harbor, and almost ended up being tied up and thrown into the sea by a gang of criminals. Whether or not there's any truth in the notion that 'nearer to the action is closer to the truth,' surely Miss Charlotte doesn't value her reports more than she does her own life?
Fontaine's famous newspaper The Steambird has a veritable legion of reporters it can call upon, each with their own area of expertise. Some specialize in celebrity gossip, others follow the word on the street, while others still focus on political affairs...
But among them all, there is one that stands head and shoulders above the rest thanks to her seemingly boundless reserve of energy and perseverance - the inimitable Charlotte.
Unswervingly committed to the principle that "nearer to the action is closer to the truth," Charlotte has a habit of popping up literally anywhere and everywhere in Fontaine - from its widest avenues to its narrowest back alleys, its highest vantage points to its lowest subterranean vaults, even its tallest mountains to its deepest undersea caverns. She captures the "truth" with her Kamera, records it in her articles, and finally unveils it for all to see.
And when the "truth" comes out, she's met with a variety of different reactions ranging from applause, to embarrassment, to outright fury. There are even some who would resort to any means necessary to make a particular article connected to themselves disappear. Or alternatively, just make Charlotte disappear.
For this reason, the newspaper's Editor-in-Chief Euphrasie has on numerous occasions felt the need to distance Charlotte from the Court of Fontaine by sending her off on faraway "field reporting" jobs, only recalling her once the Maison Gardiennage or Special Security and Surveillance Patrol had finally managed to clear things up.
But despite all this, neither the toil of the job itself nor the pressure of external denunciations and threats has ever phased Charlotte in the slightest.
With her trusty companion Monsieur Verite by her side, she invariably carries out her journalistic duties with unfaltering fervor, rushing about in pursuit of all the "truths" out there just waiting to be discovered.

In the Court of Fontaine, a new "story" is born every minute.For example, Romaritime Harbor might suddenly swell with new ships, crewed by sailors of obviously non-Fontainian origin. Some fishmonger in Poisson might suddenly buy three months' worth of fish in a single month, or countless flyers boasting of a certain place where especially delicious fish can be found might suddenly appear in the Court...In the eyes of a mediocre reporter or ordinary city folk, these are "independent" tales, just like there will always be waves rippling across the sea's surface - such ordinary events are barely worth paying attention to at all.Clumsier journalists might even chase these waves, and dispiritedly end up merely following the wave's patterns, constantly pumping out "surface-level stories" of little interest.But in Charlotte's eyes, these waves are but the superficial representation of other forces. What is causing them to crest and break? That is the story she seeks.Perhaps it is the wild winds wailing over the surface, or perhaps they are due to the Thalatta Submarine Canyon's complex seabed topography. Of course, you can't rule out the possibility of tremors from the Elton Trench either...These stories are the "deep dives" Charlotte desires.A reporter should be an agile "seeker" - not a mere gauche "recorder."This, then, is Charlotte's "work doctrine."As to how she avoids being swept up in her "deep dives"... well, that's up to Euphrasie and her fellow citizens!
Charlotte was fascinated with the world around her from a young age.The first Rainbow Rose that bloomed in the yard come spring, exceeding all others in vibrance. The children gladly padding about in puddles on the leaf-strewn streets after a storm and their hapless laughing families. The beauty of a solitary shell on the seashore, and the tiny crab surveying the world from underneath. The Blubber Profiterole she had with her family on her birthday, and the ever-so-slightly-too-deep color of the cream...To most, a flower is a flower, a shell is a shell, and a Profiterole is still a Profiterole even if it is a bit too sweet - that's just how the world is.But to Charlotte, these hidden "details" - only visible out of the corners of her eyes - are essential to understanding the world.Charlotte's father, a seasoned reporter and professional nature photographer, noticed his daughter's interest in and knack for "observation." Thus, on her tenth birthday, he gave her a custom-made Kamera, its dimensions and the positions of its buttons built specially for her."Not all people are attentive enough to seek out and observe subtle differences, but this, Charlotte, is your unique talent."Those were the words of her father, the "Reporter of the Idylls," Galanopoulo.From then on, there was a little junior reporter by the senior reporter's side. This father-daughter tag team could be found on streets wide and narrow, forests and rivers alike, raising two Kameras, one large and one small, taking countless still images of moving beauty.Even though their "interviews" always caused the gentle yet strict Mrs. Gagnepetit to nag them incessantly, Charlotte's laughter never failed to be the quickest way to make her mother stop. And as for her soiled clothes and dirtied hat, those were left to the ever-capable Mr. Galanopoulo.To her, the whole world is a giant treasure trove.And those pictures, for their part, are her special treasure maps.
Galanopoulo always emphasized one thing to Charlotte:"A picture of sufficiently great beauty cannot be ignored."With her consent, he sent the photos they'd taken to The Steambird. The editors were quickly taken with their photos - especially Charlotte's - and profusely praised Galanopoulo's ever-improving photography skills, reserving, just as before, prime placement for them in their publication.Those pictures caused quite the stir when they were published, with critics stumbling over each other to flatter them, and newspaper hobbyists fighting to get copies to make their clipping collections yet more colorful and vivid.But when both critics or fellow journalists came calling and asked how Galanopoulo advanced his aesthetic sensibilities by leaps and bounds...The veteran reporter lightly pushed Charlotte forward, saying calmly: "Ah, such pictures are beyond me. It's all my daughter's handiwork!"The experienced, learned ladies and gentlemen who had come knocking could not but fall silent first, before expressing surprise, and then beginning to whisper amongst themselves and even venturing a few questions.Charlotte blinked. The bewildered adults before her seemed every bit like little insects searching for shelter in a storm, waving their antennae this way and that, crying "Where are the leaves? Where are the leaves?""Hey, everyone, look this way!"The young child's cry caused them to collectively leap out of their worn skins, and everyone turned to look, only to be greeted by a custom-made Kamera and the click of a shutter.In that moment, all of it was captured on film - the furrowed brows, quirked lips, red faces, tangled hair, and waving arms, perfectly encapsulating those panicked bugs in the storm.The little reporter patted her Kamera and smiled toothily."I'll call this one... 'No, No, That Won't Do!'"
After Charlotte's extraordinary photography skills had made her famous, she began receiving frequent visits from manuscript writers, magazine editors, news clipping collectors, and her father's reporter colleagues. Even Euphrasie, the Editor-in-Chief of The Steambird, was amongst them.Euphrasie was straightforward about her intent. She hoped that Charlotte would agree to become a "special correspondent" - someone who would conduct interviews and write articles in addition to taking photographs....However, her father, despite his usual mild temperament, was strongly against it. He did not wish for his daughter to associate with those kinds of people, either full of ulterior motives or hypocrites."Nature is fierce, but it is honest. Storms don't loose their fury without reason, nor do beasts bare their fangs without cause.""But people lie - they always do. A Kamera can only capture their faces, but the lens cannot target their hearts."He would respect Charlotte's decision, of course, but he preferred that Charlotte live a simpler, happier life, without sinking into the morass of humanity.To Charlotte, this world was a treasure trove, and pictures her treasure maps.But for the first time, she came to realize that this trove still harbored undiscovered "truths."These truths were not themselves treasures, but were more akin to a procession of dark memories. Intentionally hidden, discarded, disguised, and then abandoned, with those having done so wishing that they would never be discovered, and that all events connected to them would simply end right there.Charlotte knew that she could find them. She could dig up these truths, like digging tulip bulbs in a garden, like leading hermit crabs out of their shells, like finding pinecones hidden by squirrels....But she also felt like a bird glimpsing an onrushing flash flood, a cave rat foreseeing an earthquake, or a fish sensing a coming tsunami.With great ability comes great responsibility.One with the talent for uncovering "truth" was also responsible for bringing the "truth" to light.The only question was, did she have the courage to do so?Her parents responded with silence, for they knew that their daughter had already made her choice. Charlotte was old enough, and all birds are destined to spread their wings and leave the nest someday.The next morning, Euphrasie went to work as usual, and there, waiting for her at the entrance to The Steambird, she saw Charlotte, ready with her Kamera and notepad."Welcome to The Steambird, Charlotte."Euphrasie extended a hand."I believe the next La Verite Prize is yours to win."
The La Verite Prize, established and funded by The Steambird, is the most prestigious prize a Fontainian reporter can win.Only the best of the best have ever won it: Hirailles and her tireless reporting on the investigative work of the Maison Gardiennage, the solitary Hobereau and his marine life photography honed over decades living by the sea, and of course, Dieuleveux, famed for his unbending, straight-talking nature, to the point where all threats and criticism simply bounced off his hide, never causing his quill to waver in the slightest.And of course, the renowned genius reporter, Charlotte, has long since joined their storied number. In fact, her reporting stands out so far above the rest that she has won the prize several times in a row.Critics have lavished her with praise, lauding her "unequaled sense of composition," "incomparably fresh angles," "unquestionable impartiality," and "unparalleled flair"...Detractors, on the other hand, believe that her successive triumphs are the result of collusion between The Steambird and the prize selection committee. How could such a young and unorthodox reporter be showered with glory, if not so the newspaper employing her could also bask in that glow? And why else would she be so close to the committee members, anyway?Even so, her talents are beyond doubt. As another round of selection for the La Verite prize drew near, all her colleagues believed that she was guaranteed to emerge victorious once again.They'd seen how she infiltrated the haunts of criminal rings alone and secretly visited illegal sweatshops... For report after report, Charlotte had braved unspeakable dangers and endured unimaginable hardships to bring the truth to readers... Whether it be in her professional dedication to the profession, her masterful manuscripts, or her attitude toward reporting, Charlotte was worthy of the committee's favor.The question on everyone's minds, really - especially those of the sponsors - was "Which one of her reports will she submit to the committee?"It would, after all, be her ticket to the La Verite Prize, and that would make it a collectors' item of... considerable value, surely.But to everyone's astonishment, Charlotte unexpectedly declared that her submission would be a brand-new, never-before-published report, one that would reveal some heretofore unrivaled "truth."Dear readers, to find out, please subscribe to The Steambird and look out for tomorrow's headline!
"Prestige Prize Proved Perniciously Partial - The Real La Verite."This was the headline on the day the award was to be announced.In it, Charlotte detailed the various monetary dealings that the long-serving members of the La Verite Award selection committee had engaged in over the previous decade, various inequities in their judgments, and provided an exhaustive list of reporters and reports who had been done dirty in the process.Her report caused an uproar in the Court of Fontaine, with countless reporters surging to the committee offices - Charlotte, of course, among them.Amidst a broadside of shutter clicks, Charlotte unleashed a barrage of meticulously-prepared questions from a thick notebook at the dumbstruck committee members, one after another. Red and shame-faced, the gentlemen flapped their clumsy lips as best they could, only to produce explications akin to porous cheese. In the end, they had to declare the questions out of order and in violation of normal procedure, before fleeing right before the gathered reporters' eyes.Charlotte's "report" had barely begun, though.She continued publishing articles concerning the La Verite Award in The Steambird, even directing her pen against certain figures in the newspaper itself who had been connected to the La Verite selection committee, laying out the manner in which they had recommended reporters with whom they shared beneficial arrangements for awards, and how those reporters had returned the favors...Charlotte's articles swept through the Fontainian media world like a tidal wave, and in response to public outcry, the Maison Gardiennage declared an official inquiry into the Award, suspending its activities and investigating all suspicious awardees.Charlotte, for her part, temporarily lived inside The Steambird's offices, with all prospective visitors "wanting a word with her" being turned away by Euphrasie with extreme prejudice. It reached the point where the Maison Gardiennage even dispatched a guard detail to the newspaper's office entrance.With her own hand Charlotte had lifted a huge stone that none had wanted to peek under, and the creepy crawlies that had lurked in its cracks and crevices now had to face the searing sunlight of the "truth."The Maison Gardiennage's investigation concluded three months later. Judges who had given unjust judgment, contestants who had contended to win glory undeserved, and editors who sought to edify themselves all received their just deserts.The La Verite Award selection committee was also wholly reorganized, now under various forms of new oversight. Once this was complete, the first thing they did was to give Charlotte the now utterly discredited award.Of course, the trophy was but dead dross to her.The real honor she had received was that the "truth" she had revealed in her report - and the ones that followed in its wake, of course - now shone in the sun.
A gift to Charlotte from her father that she carries with her to this day.Though he still didn't wish for her to take on such complicated work, her father respected her decision to formally accept the job of being a special correspondent for The Steambird.He commissioned a friend skilled with machinery and modifying Kameras, and made extensive modifications to that small Kamera.For example: Making it easier to switch out the film canisters such that Charlotte could swap film with only one hand, or making the photographic compartment water, fire, impact, and explosion-proof, to the point that the Kamera's exterior casing could be utterly destroyed, yet the compartment containing the film would remain intact and unharmed...Her father insisted on numerous modifications to which his friend initially opined, "This isn't necessary, is it...?" with a bitter smile. Nevertheless, in the end they agreed to make the modifications, including a high-powered loudspeaker that, when activated, unleashed an ear-splitting alarm, as well as a hidden self-defense system on the Kamera's side that ejected a concealed knife outward at high speed when the right button was pressed...They also included "a shutter delay device," a "lens self-coupling setup," and more...All the concerns and worries of her father were installed into the device along with all manner of contraptions, transforming it into an ever-reliable, unequaled super Kamera that reflected its owner perfectly.And when the modifications were finished, Charlotte gave it a new name - "Verite."Meaning, of course, "truth."
Charlotte does not, in fact, really know just when she obtained her Vision.Previously, she had been penning a new piece about problems in how salvage divers were treated, and had gone to interview Dollander, who employed a great number of said divers. The chubby-faced man did not seem keen on speaking the truth, and indeed was only interested in answering any questions insofar as he might redirect them. The divers he employed, too, proved quite tight-lipped.Despite the serious damage that had been done to their lungs and eardrums, the long work hours exhausting them utterly, the decrepit divesuits they used, and the inedible food, they held their silence in front of Dollander. Their smug boss smiled triumphantly at her lack of progress.By the next day, Charlotte had procured a divesuit through personal connections and was ready to get close to the divers in secret as they worked, and use her Kamera to capture Dollander's ill-treatment of them firsthand. They were in a titanic undersea rift, a place where it was completely forbidden to work according to Fontainian diving regulations.After that, Charlotte did not appear at work for a good long while. All the other Steambird reporters saw was a stream of Maison Gardiennage officers coming in and out of the office, with Euphrasie uncharacteristically ruffled, working late into the night every day.Some reporters said that they saw someone dressed in outmoded clothes, drenched and shivering as they squatted at the office entrance.Some said that an undersea earthquake had occurred in the Thalatta Submarine Canyon, where divers employed by some fellow named Dollander had been working, and that they had avoided injury by the skin of their teeth.Some other reporters even said that this Dollander had secretly put out a bounty for a Kamera that was said to contain pictures important to him.Still, Charlotte did not emerge.But reporters are most certainly not a passive lot. The Steambird's reporters began to act quietly and surreptitiously. Some utilized their personal connections to look into Dollander's business, while others followed the divers, and others still wrote pieces implicating Dollander...With The Steambird working at full steam, it was fearsomely quick indeed, and before long an extensive report on Dollander's illicit employment practices was complete.However, without any photographic evidence to corroborate the article, the reporters felt it was...Just then, the doors to the main entrance were suddenly flung wide open, and in strode Charlotte, clad in rags and sans spectacles and shoes. Placing Monsieur Verite on the table, she grinned."I have the pictures right here!"No questions were asked about what she'd been through. Instead, all worked as one, focusing on slotting each image into the report.The next day, The Steambird headline was this - "Dollander: Undersea Scrooge," detailing his illegal employment practices, salary deductions, the harm done to the health of his employees, and other vile conduct. As for the article's author, it was listed as "The Steambird Reporters."The night before that edition was to be published, Charlotte was, as always, in the printing room doing some final proofreading work.When she finished reading the final word and put the manuscript down, she suddenly noticed that an icy-blue Vision had appeared beside her hand.Scrutinizing it, all she could manage was to mumble a few words:"I think we'll have to leave out this little detail..."

<title>Adventure Rank</title>
<text>Adventure Rank (AR) is a player account progression system in 'Genshin Impact' that is raised through Adventure EXP.
Upon reaching certain Adventure Ranks, players will be able to ascend their world to the next World Level, either automatically or by completing an Ascension Quest. When a player's World Level increases, it increases the difficulty and rewards of Monsters, Bosses, and Ley Line Outcrops.
Players can level up their Adventure Rank to 60 and World Level to 8. After Adventure Rank 60 is reached, each additional point of Adventure EXP gained is instead converted to Mora at a 1:10 ratio.HoYoverse News:
After reaching World Level 5, the option to decrease the World Level by 1 becomes available from the World Level tool-tip on the Profile. Decreasing the World Level accordingly lowers the level of Ley Line Blossoms and opponents in the open world, but also decreases the rewards the player gains from defeating them. Only one adjustment to the World Level is allowed within 24 hours, after changing the World Level it cannot be reset to its original value again until the timer expires. Likewise after resetting it, it can't be lowered again immediately until after the 24 hour timer. The World Level cannot be changed while in Co-Op Mode.
If a player decides to not complete the Adventure Rank Ascension quest to go beyond the Adventure Ranks 25, 35, 45, and 50, then their Adventure Rank EXP will keep growing until it reaches the amount of EXP necessary to jump directly to Adventure Rank 60. After reaching the cap, they will be unable to gain more Adventure Rank EXP. If a player doesn't complete the Adventure Rank Ascension 1 quest, the max EXP they can reach is 1,833,800; if a player doesn't complete the Adventure Rank Ascension 2 quest, the max EXP they can reach is 1,775,025; if a player doesn't complete the Adventure Rank Ascension 3 quest, the max EXP they can reach is 1,672,400; and if a player doesn't complete the Adventure Rank Ascension 4 quest, the max EXP they can reach is 1,586,000.
Characters and Weapons gain EXP and ascensions independently of the player's Adventure Rank. However, their maximum ascension phase and level are determined by the player's Adventure Rank.
Joining another player's world requires having an equal (or higher) World Level than theirs.
Ascending to some Adventure Ranks will give you Primogems through Adventure Rank Adventurers' Guild Rewards Adventurers' Guild Rewards.
Overview
Every time a player's Adventure Rank increases, they can claim a reward from the Adventurers' Guild. They can also claim rewards from the Adventurers' Guild for completing Ascension Quests.
Players will also be able to increase the maximum level of their Characters and Weapons via Ascension up to Lv. 90. For details on perks unlocked by raising character ascension levels, see Character Ascensions Characters § Ascensions.
When players need to complete an Ascension Quest to ascend to the next World Level, Adventure Experience (AR EXP) will still accumulate, but their Adventure Rank will not increase. There is a limit to the amount of AR EXP that can be held: if a player has enough to ascend directly to AR60, they will no longer gain any Adventure Rank EXP. Once the Ascension Quest is completed, the overflow will be applied and the player's Adventure Rank will increase accordingly.
Note: Most unlocks in the world are based on adventure rank, meaning that if you reach the required adventure rank to unlock something, you will have access to it despite not having benefits given by increasing your world level.
For example, if a domain is unlocked at AR45, but you have not ascended to the corresponding world level, you will able to access the domain but not other world level benefits.

Story
Remus first appeared in the Primordial Sea, where he met the first sovereign,The original Chinese term used in Broken Goblet of the Pristine Sea is "水国的先主," which can be translated as either "first lord of the nation of water" or "previous lord of the nation of water." who is implied to be Dragon of Water the Dragon Sovereign of Water or the Primordial One. The first sovereign later gave him a goblet of primordial water, which he used to "refine mysterious drops of dew" and establish the powerful empire of Remuria.Broken Goblet of the Pristine Sea This story was also passed down through legend; according to this version of events, after being inspired by "divine revelation" and finding a seer known as Sybilla who took the form of a Golden Bee, Remus rode on a ship known as the Fortuna and created Remuria above surging waves.Secret Keepers and Forbidden Zones
The reign of Remus was a prosperous one and was known as the "golden era" of Fontaine. Remus is credited for helping his people develop agriculture, construct giant cities and temples, and spread the beauty of music and art.page=The History of the Decline and Fall of Remuria He used the Fortuna to call other tribes to join the empire of Remuria, conquering the tribes he could not convince to join him—including the kingdom known as Aremorica which Erinnyes (NPC) Erinnyes and Cassiodor hailed from.page=La Chanson d'Erinnyes
However, this golden era would come to an end. At some point Remus visited the kingdom of dragons,page=Wine Goblet of the Pristine Sea later descending into madness after hearing a prophecy about the destruction of Remuria. Hoping to help Remuria's peoples escape the flood, he mixed the primordial water with an immortal stone to create a golden Ichor, which would dissolve the physical bodies of his people while containing their souls and minds. He intended to place the Ichor full of souls into Golems to allow his subjects to live for eternity. However, the process of severing soul and body caused unbearable agony and shattered the souls, dyeing the Ichor black; it lost its harmony and wisdom, leaving only chaos and madness.page=Sublimation of Pure Sacred Dewdrop Remus also ordered that every Lochfolk and Vishap be hunted down, and attempted to replace all Primordial Water with his golden Ichor.page=Spring of Pure Sacred Dewdrop
The Dragon Scylla eventually led a rebellion of barbarians and vishaps against Remuria.page=Song of Stillness In response, the Harmost Boethius ordered the destruction of all the "barbarian tribes," which plunged Remuria into ceaseless war and rebellion and abruptly ended its golden era. The agony of the barbarian tribes awoke the sleeping Remus,page=Golden Bird's Shedding who realized his wrongdoing as Remuria was being destroyed and gave his final order in an attempt to save the empire. However, it was too late—Boethius saw his retreat as a betrayal and rallied the last of Remura's armies to steal the golden Ichor and seal Scylla underneath the tall tower with it.page=Golden Goblet of the Pristine Sea Remus and Boethius, along with Scylla, were all swept away with Remuria and its people by an "inexorable storm," heavily implied to be the Abyss.Golden Night's Bustle The golden Ichor was eventually corroded by the Primordial Sea.

<title>Chevreuse/Lore</title>
<text>The renowned Captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, always true to her own sense of "justice."
Personality
The captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, who wears justice as an ever-present seal upon her heart. Her musket shall only ever point at the guilty.
Chevreuse grew up in Court of Fontaine: Fleuve Cendre Fleuve Cendre.Fiction and Reality Inside and Outside the Frame (Quest) She is the present Captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol and a frequent customer at Beaumont Workshop, often purchasing expensive materials to maintain her musket. According to Riqueti, Chevreuse has commented about the Patrol's scarce usage of Gardemeks while under her command, claiming that "Gardemeks will only block our bullets!"Riqueti
Chevreuse has a strong sense of upholding the law, mainly in part due to her childhood when her father, Donatello, served in the Gardes. Donatello intended for her to be his successor, submitting her through rigorous trials that were meant to frustrate and vex her which she completed without much issue, making him see her even more suited to uphold "justice" than him. Unlike the other members of Fontaine's law enforcement, Chevreuse is fairly lax, allowing members to act freely from the others. She is particularly distasteful of Gardemeks, due to them blocking their musket's shots and the potential to turn against their allies in an instant. She shares a strong bond with her subordinates, refusing to accept the idea that one of them would act outside the law without sufficient proof, and when she became Captain of the Special Patrol, some of its members began using muskets and expressing a similar dislike of Gardemeks.
Despite upholding the law, Chevreuse does occasionally stoop to seemingly unlawful acts; she bribed Emerald for information regarding a mystery shooter, and turns a blind eye to Chiori throwing people out her store and driving out malignant competitors in Fontaine's fashion industry in return for intelligence. Her colleagues in the Maison Gardiennage also disapprove of her method of hiring felons as "special consultants" for cases that she personally investigates.
In her spare time, Chevreuse enjoys reading, particularly books in which justice prevails over evil.The Crack of Muskets Breaking the Silence (Quest) She also has an unhealthy obsession with junk food particularly while on work, even storing them in her uniform; when off, she considers them to be her worst enemy. She also shows disdain towards uncooked food.
Appearance
Guardian's Gun
Chevreuse uses the Medium Female Characters medium female model. She has pale skin, violet eyes fading to pink, and long violet hair with the tips all swept upwards. Her front bangs have three strands that are white, and she wears a eyepatch over her left eye.
Official Introduction
Chevreuse: Righteous Enforcer of the Law
...Captain Chevreuse, once again I implore you, we must tighten up the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol's entry requirements. Right now, we count among our members petty crooks who have burgled all over the Court of Fontaine, street fighters whose only concern is getting rich, and even a bandit whose band of cronies almost succeeded in robbing a bank! If you hadn't personally caught him red-handed — scoping the place out under the guise of being an investor — they might very well have pulled it off... For pity's sake, we're supposed to be the Maison Gardiennage! Even if just to preserve our image, please consider doing something!
"Behave yourself or the Patrol will get you!"
- A warning often issued to naughty Fontainian children from exasperated parents
Of course, those children are too young to understand how ridiculous such a thought is - that you might be dragged off by the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol for going to bed too late, eating snacks after brushing your teeth, or getting bad grades. In reality, the only people that the Patrol are really after are notorious criminals. As children grow older and come to learn this, these warnings quickly lose their effect.
...But some members of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol can't help but resent this type of "education" when they notice children on the street quietly slipping away as they approach. As they see it, painting such a picture of the Patrol couldn't be more inappropriate. If people are allowed to keep saying such things, then the Patrol's infamous reputation will loom like a shadow over the children of Fontaine, and who knows how long it will stay there?
"What's wrong with that?"
This was Special Security and Surveillance Patrol Captain Chevreuse's response as she sat there dealing with official documents.
"I hope they'll always remember our 'infamous reputation,' and understand the meaning behind it..."
"...That way, perhaps there won't need to come a day when I have to drag them away for real."
Character Stories
In the Court of Fontaine, where the corpus juris is exceedingly well-developed - some might even say convoluted - there are many odd ordinances that can confound and confuse foreign tourists.For example, fruit tarts may not be placed directly on unheated platters, unfinished Fonta may not be intentionally placed in the middle of roads, and one must not forget to trim the claws of pet felines...Violations are thus difficult to avoid. But Fontainians are quite familiar with such matters, quickly ascertaining the gravity of an offense and deciding on a course of action based on the identity of the one sent to deal with the matter.If it is only a member of the establishment's staff, then perhaps a simple debate will be sufficient to resolve the issue; who doesn't enjoy a lively atmosphere? If it is a uniformed Gestionnaire, then all onlookers will have to suffer through an insufferably long-winded admonishment, and it's best to vacate the premises. If it is an officer of the Maison Gardiennage, then the parties involved won't get off scot-free, and may even have to pay fines. In this case, it's best to immediately clarify that you are an innocent bystander, and are in no way involved with the case.However, if the one to come calling is the Captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol with her tall cap and musket slung across her back, along with a squad of Special Patrol officers...Well, that means a particularly vicious case is unfolding, or perhaps a hoodlum is to be violently apprehended, or some fiendish felon has kidnapped a hostage... In any case, the only thing to do in such a situation is to quickly evacuate in accordance with the instructions given by the Special Patrol and give these "Felon Management Specialists" room to work their magic. At the same time, keep a tight leash on your curiosity and do not attempt to conceal yourself in a nearby hidey-hole. seeking to observe their law-enforcement activities from a close distance. Even if you wish to interview them, then wait until their work is done.Most importantly, there's no need to feel unsafe, and even less cause for fear.For as all Fontainians know, any hope criminals have to escape the long arm of the law flees whenever Captain Chevreuse is on the scene.
"If you don't behave, the Special Patrol's going to take you away!"Such is the start of many a scolding given by Fontainian parents to a troublemaking child.Children who have grown up with such threats from their parents, understand very clearly that the Special Patrol will never take action because a child didn't brush their teeth, slept in, broke a window, or swiped a slice of cake. Still, though they have long since matured into adults, they cannot help but stand up a bit straighter when they see Captain Chevreuse, averting their gaze and instinctually wringing their hands, mortally afraid that they might have committed some offense worthy of arrest without having even been aware of the nature of their crime. Yet despite being crystal clear that these fine officers are fighting crime, and regardless of their reverence for such upstanding upholders of the law, it is truly difficult to suppress the urge to tense up...As for this "fearsome, infamous reputation," the Special Patrol themselves are quite exasperated. A member once suggested to Chevreuse that allowing such an "infamous reputation" to circulate is damaging to the Special Patrol's image: "The Special Patrol is an official law enforcement office under the Maison Gardiennage, after all, and if our methods of enforcing the law are more forceful, and the process thereof more intense, it's only because the criminals we deal with are the most vile and violent of them all. So to use the Special Patrol's good name to frighten children really is a bit...""Why not let Chevreuse give The Steambird an interview? Let our Captain stress that the Special Patrol is a law enforcement organization only focused on dealing with the worst offenders, and everything it does is to safeguard Fontaine's safety and stability, in pursuit of which it would never accost citizens without good cause..."Yet Chevreuse vetoed this suggestion."If such a reputation has really become so deeply embedded in the minds of the people, and it sticks with them for a lifetime, then there's a chance that when someone considers taking things a step too far, fear inspired by our 'infamous reputation' may pull them back from the edge.""...If so, then there'll be no need for us to actually take them away someday."
As one of the departments central to upholding the binding nature of Fontaine's laws and decrees, the "Court of Fontaine Grand Maison Gardiennage" is a solemn and dignified institution, and all law enforcement personnel must undergo rigorous examinations and instruction. Their every word and action reflects on the Maison Gardiennage, and represents the laws of the Court of Fontaine, so there is zero room for errors or negligence.However, the way the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol of the Court of Fontaine does things is markedly different from other law enforcement agencies. Members are not required to use standardized weapons, nor must they wear uniforms outside of formal occasions... Additionally, after Chevreuse took command of the Special Patrol, many of its members began using muskets as part of their law enforcement arsenals, and some even began to refuse to go on missions with Gardemeks on the basis that not only can an immobile meka block their line of fire, but there's a distinct danger of criminals taking control of said meka and turning them against the squad. Furthermore, when selecting recruits, the Special Patrol will even accept the descendants of criminals whose households had been stripped of all honor...For the sake of quickly solving the most heinous of cases, the Maison Gardiennage is willing to overlook all those issues, displaying great forbearance towards Chevreuse and the Special Patrol. But what they simply cannot abide is how Chevreuse is willing to invite serious felons to participate in cases she is handling as "special consultants."Though Chevreuse stridently maintains that this is purely to catch vicious criminals as soon as possible, many colleagues still believe that relying on lawbreakers to help arrest lawbreakers is an insult to both the laws of Fontaine and those who enforce them. Should such humiliations continue, what dignity would remain for the Maison Gardiennage and the law itself?Faced with such pointed questions, Chevreuse always gives the same simple response:"The greatest insult to the law is a criminal roaming free and unpunished.""And as for the 'dignity' of the Maison Gardiennage, it isn't even worthy of comparison with the safety of the Court of Fontaine."This, too, is one of her father's teachings.
"Monsieur Donatello is an upstanding officer of the law."When Chevreuse discusses her father with others, she always offers this simple, curt evaluation. This is also one of the only two impressions she has of her father from her childhood.Donatello was always busy, leaving hurriedly in the mornings and returning exhausted at night before giving Chevreuse and her mother a hug, gently apologizing for making them wait so long. Sometimes he would return exceptionally late, bringing his daughter sweet treats. Alas, having long since already brushed her teeth, it was also too late for her to have any more sugar.Such gifts were a rare treat, and yet their luster would fade by morning, and so Chevreuse's mother would allow little Chevreuse to lick a bit of cream off before sending said dessert to her father's bedroom along with a cup of coffee.At this time, her father would always be facing a wall covered in pictures and thumbtacks, at times staring blankly at it, at others pacing in circles, smoking, tousling his hair, and sometimes raising his fists in sudden triumph, before slowly lowering them and helplessly pounding the table- Chevreuse bore silent witness to all this, peeping in from behind the door.Sometimes, when she ran into her father on the street, she would excitedly wave, but at most he would return a slight smile before throwing himself back into his myriad tasks."He's an upright, good man."Her mother, neighbors, his colleagues, and even the kids next door all praised her father thusly.But one day, those colleagues who were always praising her father as an upstanding man suddenly came knocking at her door.Her mother was at a complete loss as she watched them come and go from her home. Though Chevreuse stayed in her room, from the commotion outside her door, she had already vaguely guessed that her father had become a "sinner" like those he had once pursued, and was at that moment awaiting sentencing, and might even be banished to the Fortress of Meropide."Did Papa... do something wrong?"This was the question she asked the strange adults beside her. After much choking back of tears, the reply finally came:"...Nonetheless, he is an upstanding officer of the law."An upstanding sinner.This became Chevreuse's second impression of her father from her childhood.
Even the most acclaimed authors of Fontaine would struggle to explain to a child why a suspect to whom all the evidence clearly pointed could not be convicted. Why everyone maintained their silence as an innocent officer of the law was falsely accused. Why many who witnessed the crime refused to speak the truth. And why the victim of the miscarriage of justice must pay with their own reputation and future for justice to finally make an appearance.Even harder to explain is why the path to justice must be paved with crime.But for Chevreuse, what was most concrete were the changes in her life wrought by her entire family moving to the Fleuve Cendre.A narrow room, the food less tasty, friends who now never contacted her, and a mother growing more fatigued by the day... Her father's colleagues often came by in plainclothes, bringing all kinds of gifts with them. In addition to their presents, they brought news as well. They told her mother of the appeal they were all working so hard on - not just the Gardes and the members of the Special Patrol, but even several Gestionnaires who oft worked with them - and how despite the fact Donatello had broken the law was indisputable and established fact, and legally speaking his sentence could not be commuted or shortened, they at least could ensure he didn't need to endure further castigation. It was all of scant comfort to her mother, whose worries did not subside.To take care of her mother, Chevreuse didn't hesitate to take up burdens that one as young as she should never have had to shoulder, stepping into the dark currents that swirled through the Fleuve Cendre.Perhaps it was because the residents of the Fleuve Cendre had heard tell of or been on the receiving end of her upright father's care that so many helping hands were extended to her. A well-meaning shop owner gave her a job, and the couple next door often took care of her infirm mother.And when the children of the Fleuve Cendre heard that the child of a Garde had come to live among them, they flocked to her like plaintiffs and defendants, seeking her arbitration on all manner of quarrels and disputes."Chevreuse! You gotta uphold justice, y'know!"So cried the children with one voice, before laughing as one. They did not truly intend to allow Chevreuse to determine who was at fault, but rather saw it all as merely another game.Yet the next day, Chevreuse brought a thick stack of legal materials when she went to see them, along with a notebook newly opened to the first page, and began speaking to the chortling children in a tone most serious."Very well. Let both sides present their evidence."And from that day forward, the Fleuve Cendre had one more enforcer of the law - the littlest one around. But unlike the law enforcement officers aboveground, all judgments rendered by Chevreuse were executed under her personal supervision.There in the sewers, she learned many ways to ensure that "justice" would be upheld.
"...Then, Ms. Chevreuse, in accordance with the findings of this court, your father did indeed violate the regulations of the Gardes, leaking secret intelligence regarding a serious case, and for this reason, he was exiled to the Fortress of Meropide.""From that moment onward, you followed your mother and moved to the Fleuve Cendre... As for your father's charges, and your experiences while living in the Fleuve Cendre, please provide a supplementary statement for this court.""Regarding my experiences living in the Fleuve Cendre, my statement is as follows..."Her father, Donatello, exiled for violating the law. Her poverty-stricken family forced to move to the Fleuve Cendre. A child of a sinner, unable to work for the Maison Gardiennage, and thus seeking to fight crime as a member of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol...As the Captain of the Special Patrol was hearing her case, Chevreuse found herself explaining herself and reading her statement over and over. Having finished serving his sentence, her father Donatello was now serving in the Special Patrol. He had pored over her statement, and it had nary a single mistake or blemish.Though it had been a long time since he was ousted from his former post, Donatello still understood the Maison Gardiennage's thinking. If Chevreuse was to take up the post of Captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol without issue, she would need to provide the good folks at the Maison Gardiennage with a sufficiently "decent" statement, such that they might clearly and firmly - yet with a bit of wiggle room - announce her appointment.Chevreuse was no longer a child. She knew full well that her father had leaked classified intelligence regarding a major case to utilize the resulting interest from the press to assist in investigating that criminal. After her family moved to the Fleuve Cendre, the Gardes who visited - ranking officers among them - had surreptitiously provided aid, so their situation could not be considered too dire. Furthermore, the officers and members of the Special Patrol had made preparations ahead of time for Chevreuse to learn from them in the field, learning all about the relevant work in advance...But saying all of that would be of no help to Chevreuse in taking over as Captain.Though Donatello was still uneasy about his daughter following in his footsteps, she had completed all the training he had prepared for her. Chevreuse had given it her all, passing even those trials designed expressly to frustrate and vex her.As Chevreuse plunged forward in the bone-chillingly freezing winter seas, it seemed to take every last ounce of Donatello's willpower to stand still and watch instead of running forth to cradle her in his embrace. As Chevreuse swam back to his side, trembling and shivering, Donatello knew that his daughter was stronger than he was, and even more suited to uphold "justice."But today, let all of that be washed away into eternal silence amid the waters of the Fleuve Cendre.For this father and daughter who long ago had swum together in the icy winter seas, it was now time to take a step forward."...My father violated Gardes regulations. The evidence of his guilt is conclusive, and the results of the hearing were correct."With her final assertion of the facts of the case, Chevreuse folded up the draft of her speech.Hereafter, justice would make its appearance, all in good time.
Compared to the initial configuration, the improved version of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol's standard musket features a modified butt stock that better fits human shoulders, as well as a longer barrel. Some specialized Type-II muskets feature all-purpose rails attached below the barrel and to the stock. Scopes, grenade launchers, smokescreen launchers, sonic boom launchers, and all kinds of melee weapons are among the various accessories that can be attached to the mounts, allowing them to be adapted for virtually any kind of combat mission.However, while she was modifying muskets to improve the team's combat capabilities, Chevreuse also raised the evaluation standards for firearms proficiency, adding several requirements not related to firearms themselves, such as unarmed combat."The raison d'etre for the Special Patrol is capturing criminals, not strutting around showing off your gun!""What are you gonna do, refuse a mission if you can't bring your musket?"And thus, thanks to the Type-II Standard Musket, the amount of training required vastly increased once more.Naturally, Chevreuse herself completed 100% of every single training program.Seeing their captain standing strong like an ironwoman in the middle of the practice field, the members of the patrol spoke out spontaneously, yet with one heart and one voice:"Captain, please have mercy on us...!"
The Captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, Chevreuse, rarely discusses how she obtained her Vision of her own accord. To others, she says the reason is because the authority and prestige of the Special Patrol comes from the law and justice. By focusing too much on "Visions," it would only create misunderstandings. To preserve the law's standing, it is better not to discuss such things.But those close to Chevreuse know that this Vision is much more akin to a heavy burden for her.After Chevreuse joined the Special Patrol, she used her extraordinary talent and perseverance to complete all kinds of internal training programs, memorizing every rule, regulation, and standard for Special Patrol operations along with the related statutes. Without question, she was first in her class, and her pursuit of "justice" was widely admired by other members.But the officer in charge of them, Vice Captain Grizzetti, disagreed, and he never selected Chevreuse for field missions. Other members could only guess why: Perhaps it was to protect her? After all, he was once close with her father Donatello, and had taken care of her. They were so close that Chevreuse was said to call him "Uncle Grizzetti." Or maybe he was planning to groom her to take on some particularly important job?Chevreuse didn't think about such complicated matters. After the sixth time she was excluded from a mission, she could bear it no longer and finally asked the usually amiable Uncle Grizzetti why he never chose her for fieldwork."You're not ready."Came the reply."Fix your conception of justice first, Chevreuse. If your understanding of it is limited to an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, then it would be best for you to leave this place. This is not some lynching site. This is where the voice of justice must ring true."At the time, Chevreuse had not yet grasped this, nor did she even know just when she would be ready. Perhaps she would spend her entire life trying to understand. Or perhaps she would have to be ready the very next second.Soon, Grizzetti found himself shorthanded during an urgent mission hunting down a gang of notorious criminals. With no choice but to call on Chevreuse, he repeatedly warned her to stay close, follow orders, and not act without permission. And then it was time to move out, and the various members filed out into the howling tempest to close off every possible route the gang of criminals could take.Chevreuse and Grizzetti concealed themselves behind some shrubbery, but the criminals did not appear. Just as the two of them began to think their intelligence was mistaken and were preparing to withdraw quietly, a shot rang out from a hidden position, and Grizzetti was struck. Chevreuse counterattacked nearly instantly, using the muzzle flash in the darkness to sight the criminal's position before hitting them with a single precise bullet. But Uncle Grizzetti had already sunk into eternal silence.Now, only Chevreuse and the killer remained. The howling wind and torrential downpour would conceal the sound of another gunshot, and the Special Patrol... They might not inquire too closely in the case of how this fiend who had murdered one of their colleagues had been shot dead.But more importantly, the killer was right in front of her. If she wished to carry out justice, now was the time. She lifted her musket, aimed right between his eyes... and then lowered the gun.The Special Security and Surveillance Patrol speaks only in the name of justice, and true "justice" can only be decided by the courts. Perhaps this was what it meant to be "ready" to become a member of the Special Patrol."This is the Court of Fontaine Special Security and Surveillance Patrol. You are under arrest."No sooner had she finished speaking than the killer began to hobble away, seeking to flee without the slightest hesitation. With the crack of a musket, the man was struck squarely in his right leg. He cried out in agony, cursing as he rolled on the ground, finally coming to a stop before the feet of the other Patrol members who had rushed over.The "justice" of the law is meted out by the courts, but as for Chevreuse's own personal justice, that is carried out by her alone.As Chevreuse finally completely lowered her musket, she had yet to notice a Vision was now hanging from the stock.In the lashing wind and rain, its glow was not readily apparent, much like justice yet to be revealed - pale and dark.

<text>The Heavenly Principles, also called destiny or the divine in early parts of the English localization,天理 rm=Tiānlǐ tl=Heavenly Principles lit=Heaven's law, natural order was used in '' and 'Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail', but they were inconsistently localized into English and were never redubbed. While this term was also inconsistently localized during earlier versions of the game, they have mostly been standardized to "Heavenly Principles." is an enigmatic entity in 'Genshin Impact' that currently serves as the ruler of Celestia and Teyvat. The intrigue surrounding, and plots against, the Heavenly Principles are the driving force behind the conflicts of the game, as both the Abyss Order and the Fatui seek to overthrow it and end its rule over Teyvat.This article uses the singular pronoun "it" to refer to the Heavenly Principles, keeping in line with the English localization of 'A Toast to Victory'. The previous quest, 'Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies', refers to the Heavenly Principles in the plural. By comparison, the original Chinese texts in both instances do not use any pronouns or otherwise indicate whether the Heavenly Principles is a single entity or multiple entities referred to as a collective.
The Heavenly Principles has been silent since the cataclysm 500 years ago.Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies
The unknown god who stopped the Traveler and the Traveler's sibling 500 years ago in the game's opening cutscene introduced herself as the "sustainer of Heavenly Principles," but what this means is not yet understood.

Profile
Lesser Lord Kusanali hypothesizes that the Heavenly Principles is the First Descender, the first entity who came from outside this world and, as a result, is not recorded in Irminsul.A Toast to Victory It took over the world from the Seven Sovereigns, the seven ancient dragons who were the strongest of their element, and ultimately emerged victorious over them. To combat the effects of forbidden knowledge, which was brought to this world by the Dragon King Nibelung, it sent down several divine nails, which stabilized the world but wreaked havoc on nature and those living on the earth.What Shape Does the Self HoldAmethyst Crown
The Heavenly Principles is presumably the creator of Teyvat's "laws," which are now embodied by the Gnosis Gnoses, seven chess pieces originally given to the Seven Archons which also allow them to directly resonate with Celestia.Ending Note The first of the Seven Archons (typically known simply as "The Seven") emerged during the Archon War, a chaotic and destructive period of wars across Teyvat which led to the deaths or disappearances of most gods. The Seven are subordinate to the Heavenly Principles and are subject to the rules and constraints placed on them. One such restriction is talking about the "other side" to how Visions are distributed (with the first side being a person's desire).
The "laws" are also notably mentioned in a Loading Screen World Loading Screen tip ("Teyvat has its own 'laws'") and in the book 'Scroll of Streaming Song', where it is the answer to the second riddle:"You speak of the universal law created in heaven, the divine laws established in the beginning.""No one has seen the eternal law, yet it governs all.""One may only bow down and worship Vaana of the heavenly spirits — no arrogation, deception, or trickery is permitted.""If one dares to imitate the forbidden arts, only calamity awaits at the edge of divine knowledge."
The Heavenly Principles is capable of delivering effectively irreversible curses that fundamentally change people.The Grave of the Guarded Hilichurls are actually transfigured humans, afflicted with the "curse of wilderness" which robs them of their forms and intellect; this was the curse given to non-pure-blooded Khaenri'ahns during the cataclysm, and as hilichurls have existed since before the cataclysm,Archive Description: Hilichurl Descriptions Hilichurl it was presumably inflicted on humans predating the cataclysm, though there is not enough information to figure out for what reasons.One notable hilichurl member is a Frostarm Lawachurl found on Dragonspine whose displayed name is Ukko. Pure-blooded Khaenri'ahns were instead given a curse of immortality. A similar curse was inflicted on the Seelie as punishment after the war against the Sovereigns, reducing them to their current miniscule forms, although some - such as Nabu Malikata and the Seelie in 'A Drunkard's Tale' - were able to escape the worst parts of the curse.Ay-Khanoum's Myriad

Story
Ancient History
In ancient times, the Heavenly Principles appeared in Teyvat and took over the world. The rulers of the old world, the Seven Sovereigns, attempted to fight back. Believing only another power from outside this world would be able to defeat it, the Dragon King Nibelung came across forbidden knowledge and used it to fight the Heavenly Principles. Invaders came from "beyond the firmament," bringing destruction and plagues, and the resulting war destroyed both heaven and earth. Afraid of the "rising tide of delusion and breakthroughs" brought by the invaders, the Heavenly Principles used the divine nails to prevent the world's collapse, but this also wreaked havoc on the mortal world.
The Seelie, despite having fought against the invaders from beyond the firmament, were punished with exile from heaven and stripped of their beautiful forms and their wisdom. This punishment may relate to a legend about a Seelie ancestor's union with an "outlander," only for a sudden disaster to strike thirty days later, which caused the world's collapse and forced them to flee from an unidentified force. They were caught and punished with eternal separation and the erasure of their memories. According to the legend, the Seelie's and the Moon Sisters' grief at this outcome caused them to wither away, and fragments of themselves became the modern Seelie.Records of Jueyun
According to other legends, Morax - who is over 6,000 years oldSolitary Fragrance - was young when the Moon Sisters were slain in a certain calamity.Solar Relic It is not clear whether this calamity was the same as the Heavenly Principles' conflict against the Seven Sovereigns, but this gives a rough estimate for how long ago these events may have occurred.
Archon War
An exchange between Scaramouche and Nahida suggests that the Heavenly Principles instigated the Archon War, in which the gods fought to claim one of the seven divine thrones and obtain a Gnosis, an item which symbolizes the Heavenly Principles' control over Teyvat and all the laws. Scaramouche remarks on the Archon War by saying, "Strife is engraved upon every god and every Gnosis brought forth into this world," to which Lesser Lord Kusanali responds that "All those losses were meaningless, driven by the demands of the 'laws.'"
Around 2,000 years ago and before the Archon War ended, the Heavenly Principles was directly involved with the serpent god Orobashi and Watatsumi Island. After failing to defeat two different gods in the Archon War, Orobashi was fleeing to the Dark Sea when it fell into a rift and discovered the people of EnkanomiyaOathsworn Eye - a surviving remnant of the Primordial One's ancient unified civilization, spared from destruction when it sank underwater during the struggle against the Second Who Came. Although the people of Enkanomiya searched for a way to return to the surface in the past, their attempts ended in failure due to a ban placed on their ancestors which prevented them from finding a way home. This ban is attributed to the Primordial One by the author of 'Before Sun and Moon',The Byakuyakoku Collection and generically to the "heavenly order" by Eboshi. The rift Orobashi fell through has been attributed to the heavens' weakening power of prohibition.The Three Great Martial Trials It agreed to become the god of the Enkanomiya people, but this led Orobashi to come into contact with 'Before Sun and Moon', a book which told a history of the world which the Heavenly Principles did not want known. The Heavenly Principles forced Orobashi to sacrifice itself in exchange for allowing the people of Enkanomiya to return to the surface, with the truth behind its sacrifice unknown to all besides a select few close aides. 'Before Sun and Moon' was subsequently banned, and an attempt by Khaenri'ahn agents to steal the book for its secrets was thwarted.Antigonus
Orobashi's sacrifice took the form of leading a doomed war against the Raiden Shoguns Makoto and Ei. This decision was also spurred by Watatsumi Island's lack of natural resources, which led its people to set its eyes on conquering Yashiori Island, which was under the Raiden Shoguns' jurisdiction. The war was disastrous for the Watatsumi people; Orobashi was executed by Ei's Musou no Hitotachi while most of the island's other prominent figures were also slain or otherwise disappeared.A Preliminary Study of Sangonomiya Folk Belief At the moment of its death, Orobashi turned its eyes up to the heavens in defiance.Official Website, Serpent's Head description: 'Of the giant serpent that was defeated by the Electro Archon with the Musou no Hitotachi, only its weather-bleached remains are left today. Although its skull still looks up at the sky defiantly, the god is already dead, and so the name of "Watatsumi Omikami" is gradually being forgotten.'
At some point, the Hydro Archon Egeria created "life" by transforming her Oceanid followers into "humans" by injecting their blood with water from Primordial Sea to fulfill their desires of enjoying surface life. This act did not go unnoticed by the Heavenly Principles, who then punished them with "original sin" for creating "life" without permission and decreed a Prophecy of Fontaine prophecy that the waters would rise to dissolve Fontanians, leaving the Hydro Archon alone. Egeria did not want her followers to be harmed, and thus appointed her fellow Oceanid Focalors to succeed her when she died.
Cataclysm
500 years ago, a surge of forbidden knowledgeInteractable: Gavireh Lajavard Someone's Abandoned Letter Someone's Abandoned Letter emerged from Khaenri'ah, wreaking havoc on both Khaenri'ah and Teyvat. The Seven, with the exception of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata who was tasked with defending Irminsul, were gathered to combat the threat from Khaenri'ah. One battle took place at Tunigi Hollow, where the first Hydro Archon Egeria was slain; the remains of her consciousness and power were transformed into the Harvisptokhm by RukkhadevataVibrant Pinion and used as a seal over the hollow to prevent more Abyssal power from infiltrating Teyvat. The other Seven, at some point, entered the depths of Khaenri'ah, where Electro Archon Raiden Makoto was slain.Cleansing Light
"The gods" ultimately destroyed Khaenri'ah,Dishonorable Trial although The Seven may have been unwillingly involved.The Omnipresent God Ei: But I've seen a nation stride forward and lose everything to the Heavenly Principles The Khaenri'ahns who managed to survive were cursed; pure-blooded Khaenri'ahns were cursed with immortality, while others - those who came from Teyvat or those who descended from mixed-blood marriages - were given the "curse of wilderness," which transformed them into various entities, which were mostly hilichurls.Fortune-Mocking Pedigree Several of The Seven were jaded by the events of the cataclysm; the new Electro Archon Ei, Makoto's twin sister, broke ties with the Heavenly Principles and soon left her Gnosis in Yae Miko's possession,Wishes (Quest) while the Tsaritsa joined forces with former Khaenri'ahn royal mage Pierro to establish the Fatui.Mocking Mask
The Traveler's sibling, who appeared in Khaenri'ah after "the heavens responded to the summoning"The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call and became the f=Prince of Khaenri'ah,Portended Fate was horrified by the destruction. They tried to flee this world, waking up the Traveler and getting as far as CelestiaIt is assumed that the location of the siblings' fight against the unknown god is Celestia due to the prevalence of the Symbols in Teyvat Celestial Motif Celestial motif in the area and the location seeming to be located in the sky. when they were intercepted and sealed away by the unknown god.
Somehow, the Traveler's sibling ended up traveling Teyvat, sometimes with Dainsleif. The sibling eventually became the leader of the Abyss Order, an organization established by Chlothar Alberich which worships a certain self-proclaimed "Sinner" and aims to destroy the Heavenly Principles by engulfing the "thrones" with the Abyss.YouTube: A Soul Set Apart Dainsleif, however, opposes them and believes that rousing the gods' ire will only repeat Khaenri'ah's past mistakes.
Following Egeria's death during the Cataclysm, Focalors succeeded her as the Hydro Archon. Thrust with the looming prophecy, she sought to find a way to deceive the Heavenly Principles while fulfilling it at the same time in order to protect her people. Focalors decided on a plan in which she split herself into two halves - the "divine" which kept the Hydro Gnosis, and a "body" named Furina, who she tasked with roleplaying as her to keep her true identity a secret, or the plan would fail. In the subsequent trials hosted at the Opera Epiclese, Focalors would accumulate the Indemntium to create a massive sword which she would use to kill herself with, while a small portion powered Fontaine's energy needs. She also came into contact with the reborn Dragon of Water, Neuvillette, and had him serve as her Iudex; one to return his Authority to him when she killed herself, and also hoping that his new perspectives of humanity would make him want to save her people. Neuvillette was not aware of this at the time but accepted out of a need to find answers for himself, while Furina was successful in duping the masses for the next 500 years.
Present Day
The Traveler woke up 500 years after being sealed by the Unknown God and eventually met Paimon. After learning about some of Teyvat's language and history from her, the two decide to search for The Seven and find their sibling, thus starting the events of the game.
The Traveler also attempts to find information about Khaenri'ah and the disaster they witnessed, but finds little relevant information before meeting Dainsleif. While the Heavenly Principles has been silent for the past 500 years, most of The Seven are still reluctant or unable to give information about forbidden subjects.Amidst Chaos, the Rock Is Unmoved
In Transient Dreams, Makoto's consciousness is briefly reawakened in the chaotic space of her realm of consciousness. She gave Ei a seed of light - the yet-unplanted Sacred Sakura - and describes it with:"Eternity extends time into infinity, dreams illuminate each moment within."When both shine in unison, the Sacred Sakura blooms from the darkness, finally free from the clutches of the Heavenly Principles."Now, the nightmare has dissipated, and reality is made whole. The vision we both yearn for is still further ahead."
Ei suspects that a "higher power" - namely Istaroth, one of the Primordial One's Four Shades - was involved in creating the Sacred Sakura, and that it was not Makoto's power alone.Radiant Sakura
During Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies, Lesser Lord Kusanali bluffs Il Dottore into making a concession in exchange for the Electro Gnosis by threatening to destroy it, damage the "laws," and potentially awaken the Heavenly Principles.
When the Traveler arrived at Fontaine, rumors of the prophecy began to manifest after the general public learned about the Primordial Water that could dissolve them as a result of Marcel (Fontaine) Marcel's use of it in the serial disappearances case and a public dissolving of the Garde Vaughn to stop him from leaking his identity. Throughout the events of Fontaine's Archon Quests, the Traveler and Neuvillette were able to discern the truth about the prophecy, putting Furina on trial in an attempt to know her secrets to stop it. Just as Furina's identity was compromised, Focalors had accumulated enough Indemntium to kill herself, shattering the Divine Throne of Hydro and restoring Neuvillette's Authority. The prophecy was still carried out as usual, but Neuvillette had absolved the Fontanians' sins and made them "true" humans, making them immune to dissolution and Focalors' death satisfied the Heavenly Principles' demand.Masquerade of the Guilty

<title>Ursa the Drake</title>
<text>Ursa the Drake was a dragon draconic creature that plagued Mondstadt for over a thousand years until it was finally vanquished by Il Dottore at an unknown point in time in the recent past.
It only appears in the manga, but has been mentioned in the game.
Story
1000 Years Ago
While Vennessa's tribe was wandering the wilderness, they one day ran afoul of Ursa the Drake. It hounded them for four days, starving them and forcing them to seek refuge in the City of Mondstadt. Though they were safe from Ursa, they found themselves enslaved by the tyrannical aristocracy that now ruled the city.
Ten years later, Vennessa raised the ire of Barca Lawrence, the heir to the city's ruler, Lord Lawrence, when she protected Venti during Ludi Harpastum. In retaliation, Lord Lawrence purchased her and her clan, then imprisoned her and forced her to fight twelve battles for her freedom. Her final battle turned out to be against Ursa the Drake - and her clan would be fighting with her. With Ursa and its hilichurls on one side and Lawrence's archers on the other, Vennessa despaired about their certain death but pressed on anyways. At this moment, Venti - revealing himself as the Anemo Archon, Barbatos - appeared and helped Vennessa subdue the dragon, forcing it and its army to flee.
4 Years Ago
On Diluc's eighteenth birthday, he and his father, Crepus, were returning from Angel's Share to Dawn Winery when they were suddenly attacked by Ursa. Even Diluc was unable to land a scratch on it, but Crepus managed to drive it away by using a Delusion - only to be slain by the Delusion's power when it backfired on him. Unbeknownst to Diluc and Kaeya, who came to help them shortly after its departure, Ursa's attack was instigated by a metal bug placed by the Fatui.
Eroch, an Investigator in the Knights of Favonius, told Diluc to take the credit for defeating Ursa, claiming that the Knights of Favonius' reputation would be hit if people discovered that a "mere businessman" had done the deed. Enraged by this statement, Diluc resigned from the Knights of Favonius. Eroch then took the credit for himself, which prompted Grand Master Varka to open an investigation after Jean reported the circumstances to him.All's Well That Ends Well (Quest) This eventually led to Eroch and his supporters to be ousted from the Knights of Favonius.Event Hidden Strife Interactables: Hidden Strife Story Optional Letters Optional Letters
Ursa's Death
An unknown time after Crepus' tragic death, Dottore slew Ursa. This incident indebted Mondstadt to Snezhnaya and forced them into a less favorable position with the Fatui.
Abilities
* Language Fluency: It appears that Ursa was capable of speech, or at the very least could understand human language, as Lord Lawrence says he secured a pact for lasting peace from its attacks by offering Vennessa and her tribe up as sacrifices to them.
* Hilichurl Control: Ursa the Drake is seen controlling hilichurls while attacking Vennessa and her clan outside Mondstadt. Notably, some of those hilichurls have wings - suggesting such hilichurls used to exist.

<title>Cesar</title>
<text>Cesar is an NPC that appears in a flashback during The Forgotten Thief.
Profile
Cesar was a well-known magician in Fontaine who enjoyed performing for the masses. He took on Lorenzo as an assistant to help him with his tricks. The public adored him, especially children who wanted their wishes to become true. At some point, he entered a relationship with Jemma, unaware that she was intending to use him as a scapegoat for her crimes.
Ten years before the events of the game, Cesar was approached by Lyney and Lynette, who sought him out in order to learn more about being a magician. Cesar was worried about where their parents were and told them that learning magic was hard, but after seeing their seriousness, accepted them without hesitation. He was unaware that they were actually part of the Fatui, as the twins had approached him in order to perfect their tricks; while they had some talent, Lyney knew that without the guidance of a professional magician, their skills would plateau, and they needed the assistance in order to perfect their own tricks for the missions given to them by Arlecchino.
During the ten days Cesar spent with them, he noted their natural talent and told them not to call him "Master", seeing them as the real geniuses. He was also able to discern that they were far too mature for their age and guessed that they had to grow quickly, though not wanting to know what befell them. He also noted that both Lorenzo and Jemma were agitated by their presence, the latter telling him that their eyes were far too "sharp" for her liking. Eventually, he discovered that they had lied to him and had a feel for their personalities, discovering that they were not like other children and had hard and dangerous lives, which made him upset that he could not do more to help them. He decided to cheer them up by telling them that as magicians, they would have to find their own truth in a world full of lies and falsehoods, though he believed they did not pay too much attention to them.
Cesar then decided to go on tour, asking the twins to come with him, but they declined, as they had to help their "Father" out with their missions. Cesar toured Fontaine and attempted a high-drop trick at the Opera Epiclese. However, when he performed the trick, he discovered too late that he had been sabotaged, and rather than the dummy falling out from the box, he did. He immediately died upon impact with the ground, and after the Gardes searched his belongings, discovered that he was the Phantom Weasel and closed the case, tarnishing his legacy. Jemma, who sought to frame Cesar as the Phantom Thief, noticed Lorenzo's anguish and conspired with him to kill Cesar, who had his own motives too; he felt that he was not getting the attention and wealth he deserved for helping Cesar and chose to eliminate him, as he posed too much of an obstacle for him to be a magician.
When Lyney and Lynette returned from their missions, they learned of Cesar's death and his subsequent identity as the Phantom Weasel, though both doubted the notion, knowing that he was far too benevolent to do so. Years later, they concocted a plan to draw out the true Phantom Weasel with the Traveler's help and discover the truth of the incident. Once Lorenzo was apprehended as the Phantom Weasel, Cesar's legacy was restored and Lyney held a memorial service for him. The following day, the twins realized that Jemma was the true Phantom Weasel and cornered her, and when she asked why they had gone so far for her, Lyney told them that he and Lynette would never forget acts of kindness to them, having taken Cesar's words to heart.

<text>the previous Electro Archon the playable character Raiden Shogun the current deity who is titled Raiden Shogun Ei
Raiden Makoto ja=雷 らい 電 でん 眞 まこと ja_rm=Raiden Makoto, also known by her Goetic name Baal, was the original Electro Archon of Inazuma, and predecessor to her younger twin sister, Ei. Makoto's divine ideal was also "eternity," but rather than Ei's pursuit of solemn stillness, Makoto cherished each moment within time and space.In 'Radiant Sakura', Makoto confirms that her ideal is also eternity, that "Eternity extends time into infinity, dreams illuminate each moment within." Ei comments that Makoto's understanding of eternity is much more profound than her, leading to her "no longer pursuing an eternity defined by stasis." In Wishes (Quest) showType=0, Yae Miko points out that Makoto "in each moment cherished the beauty of what was before her."
Makoto was one of the casualties in the cataclysm 500 years ago. Since then, Ei has assumed the Shogunate.
Profile
Introduction
Makoto and Ei were identical twin gods who lived during the time of the Archon War. While Ei was a far more formidable warrior than the peaceful Makoto, Ei believed Makoto to be a better ruler for humanity. After prevailing and slaying all their rivals, Ei willingly sacrificed her body so Makoto could ascend to Celestia and become one of The Seven. After becoming the first Electro Archon, Makoto recreated Ei's body and made Ei her 'kagemusha' ja=影武者 ja_tl=shadow warrior, or body double.Treasured Tales of the Chouken Shinkageuchi As far as the world was aware, there were not two, but one. They complemented each other, and they ruled Inazuma jointly; therefore, there was no need for the public to know the truth. The name "Baal" and the title of Raiden Shogun were understood to refer to both of them.
Story
History
Alongside her sister Ei, the two prevailed during the Archon War and ruled Inazuma justly, with all those living under their domain doing so in peace. Makoto agreed to let Ei serve as her kagemusha and met with the original Seven from time to time in Liyue. When governing Inazuma, Makoto presumably handled general affairs, while Ei would handle those that would require force.
The two would live in relative peace until the cataclysm 500 years prior to the start of the game, when monsters began appearing across Inazuma and leaving mass trails of destruction in their wake. Makoto headed to Khaenri'ah alone without informing Ei, as she was compelled to do so. By the time Ei found Makoto in Khaenri'ah, she had already fallen unconscious in the ensuing battle and was dying; however, Ei was able to save part of her consciousness and moved it to a torii gate underneath the Grand Narukami Shrine. Before her physical death, Makoto had also imbued part of the Musou Isshin with her consciousness that would only awaken when Ei had used its full power, and also spawned the Sacred Sakura on top of Mt. Yougou. Ei would use the Sacred Sakura to destroy the monsters terrorizing Inazuma.
After defeating the Shogun in a grueling duel, Makoto's consciousness spawned from the sword due to Ei using its full power. She apologized to Ei for leaving her so suddenly, having intended to slowly convince her of her views over time but could not as she could not ignore Khaenri'ah. Before the last of her consciousness faded away, she handed Ei a seed of the Sacred Sakura and lamented that she could not see what Inazuma looked like in the present day. Ei believed that Makoto had Istaroth involved in the creation of the Sacred Sakura and that without her intervention, Inazuma would have been consumed by the darkness.

<title>Diluc/Lore</title>
<text>As the wealthiest gentleman in Mondstadt, the ever-dapper Diluc always presents himself as the epitome of perfection. But behind the courteous visage burns a zealous soul that has sworn to protect Mondstadt at all costs, allowing him to mercilessly vanquish all who threaten his city.
Personality
The tycoon of a winery empire in Mondstadt, unmatched in every possible way.
Kaeya calls himself and Diluc "anti-heroes with attitude problems." He decided to take matters into his own hands by becoming, to his dismay and embarrassment, the "Darknight Hero" to protect Mondstadt's people.
Diluc was once an ideal young man, dedicated to his work with Knights of Favonius. After his father's untimely demise as a result of using a Delusion, along with Inspector Eroch ordering Diluc to cover up the incident, his faith in the Knights shattered and he left the organization. Even after Eroch was purged from the Knights for being a traitor, he still holds resentment towards them. He claims that the Knights take too long to get the job done, although he still appreciates those who put the effort in, such as Lisa and Jean.
When he was a member of the Knights, he adored his father, Crepus. Being praised by his father made him happier than fame and anything else, and Crepus told Diluc to be faithful in his duties. After his father's death, he has been suppressing himself. Despite coming off as bitter and grumpy through his speech, he has a gentle, tender, and modest nature. In his childhood, Diluc had a lighthearted and happy nature, rather to the contrary of him now.
Diluc is not fond of alcohol, as he does not like its taste and that it clouds his mind when he tries to work. He prefers non-alcoholic drinks such as grape juice and apple cider, which he had ordered developed upon his return to Mondstadt. This does not appear to be well known by many however, most likely as a result of him being the current owner of Mondstadt's largest wine producer. He even expresses surprise when he learns that Diona also loathes alcohol, having initially believed that he was the only bartender in Mondstadt that did not like alcohol. He also tends to part with his possessions he no longer needs, such as his father's private residence.
Appearance
Darknight Blaze Red Dead of Night
Diluc uses the Tall Male Characters tall male model. He has pale skin, red eyes, and bright red hair that goes down to the middle of his back.
Official Introduction
Diluc: "I will keep marching on until dawn."
Mr. Diluc is like a fine wine but with too much ice. The first sip tastes heavenly, but drink too much and it gives you brain freeze.
▌Master of the Dawn Winery · Diluc
I will keep marching on until dawn.
People in Mondstadt like to have a glass of dandelion wine after a long day. As your vision begins to waver and mind starts to wander, refraining from pouring another one seems impossible.
The constant flow of brews keeps Diluc, operator of Mondstadt's biggest supplier, "Dawn Winery," firmly in the position of the richest man in Mondstadt.
But what no-one can make sense of is, despite building his enterprise on wine, Diluc has never touched a single drop, no matter the occasion.
When asked by outsiders as to why, his response is always the same - a polite yet mysterious and faint smile that always brings about a multitude of guesses.
But this question is never asked by anyone at the winery, for they have all long since known the answer - Diluc simply doesn't like wine.
Character Stories
As the city of ballads and wines, Mondstadt's alcohol industry is renowned all over Teyvat.As owner of the Dawn Winery, Diluc is essentially in charge of half the industry. This means he has a huge stream of revenue and an entire network of information, in the form of tavern patrons' gossip, right at his fingertips.In a way, he is the uncrowned king of Mondstadt.
The scent of wine always lingers in the air in Mondstadt.If one were to follow the scent to its source, one would invariably arrive at Diluc's Dawn Winery.A wooden plaque proudly announces the winery's name, and beneath it is written the winery's motto:"Shine True."Most interpret this to mean that the wines are brewed for consistency of taste, with time-honored techniques and that same healthy dose of sunny optimism that the dawn brings.Meanwhile, the more pragmatic Knights of Favonius are reminded of the long history of mutual support between the winery and the city.The winery holds festivities from time to time. These events are routinely attended by enthusiastic fathers, eager to introduce their wonderful daughters to the young and single winery master.This is all highly entertaining to the other guests, who watch on and comment, mockingly:"We'd much rather Master Diluc stays married to the winery, given how good this wine is!"Diluc deals impeccably with all situations, no matter who or what comes his way.Diluc is a fine young gentleman in every conceivable respect.
Diluc avoids talking about the past."If only Diluc were still a member of the Knights..."After a few drinks, senior knights will say words to this effect with a sigh.They refer to events from a long time ago, back when Diluc's father, Master Crepus, was still the owner of the winery. Master Crepus' wish was for his son to become the most esteemed knight of all and safeguard Mondstadt, the City of Freedom.As per his father's wishes, Diluc trained rigorously to make himself worthy of the Ragnvindr name. Sure enough, he passed the Knights of Favonius' trials, swore the oath of protection to Mondstadt, and entered their ranks. Before long, he received an early promotion which saw him become the youngest-ever Cavalry Captain.Over the course of his missions and patrols, the denizens of Mondstadt gradually came to know this young and passionate Cavalry Captain.No matter what the missions demanded from him, he always maintained his composure and his passion. No matter how big the challenge before him, his boundless courage always led him to the front line. The praise he received from his comrades and citizens spurred him on.But the words of praise he valued most of all were:"Good job. Now, that's my son."His father's words fueled the fire inside his heart and served as his greatest motivation.His faith was an unquenchable fire that burned strong and bright inside him.Diluc was so young back then.
"Sometimes, life can change in an instant."The day that Crepus spoke these words to Diluc would turn out to be the latter's last as a Knight of Favonius.For on that day, a Ursa the Drake horrific monster attacked the transport fleet he and his father were traveling with.There was no time for Diluc to send for help. The monster was stronger than any foe the young Cavalry Captain had ever encountered, and overpowered him.Diluc could never have anticipated the way this battle would end: His father, who had been denied admittance into the Knights and who was shunned by the gods, defeated the monster with an Delusion unknown evil power - before that same power backfired, mortally wounding Crepus himself. Crepus died shortly after in his son's arms.With a heavy heart, Diluc returned to the Knights' headquarters, only to receive an unthinkable order from Inspector Eroch: "Conceal the truth."Eroch insisted that the incident must be portrayed as an unfortunate accident in order to maintain the reputation of the Knights of Favonius in the eyes of the public.Such was the sheer outrageousness of this request that Diluc did not think it was even worth trying to argue.Diluc's father had once said to him that the world would never turn its back on the faithful.But now, the Knights of Favonius trampled on his faith like it was nothing. He couldn't help but wonder: What was his father's view on faith in his final moments?Diluc resigned from the Knights that day and left everything behind, including his Vision.He swore to avenge his father's death, and to find the source of that occult power which had caused his father's demise.
After Diluc resigned and discarded his Vision, he handed the running of the Dawn Winery over to the Adelinde head housemaid and left Mondstadt altogether.Diluc traveled all across the seven nations of Teyvat in search of the truth.All clues pointed toward a behemoth of an organization: The Fatui. He learned that they made counterfeit Visions in secret, calling them "Delusions." A Delusion could amplify the power of its bearer to its extreme, but also carried the risk of backfiring. That was what had caused his father's death.Was it possible that his father could have obtained such a sacrilegious item in order to do good?Diluc knew he may never know the full truth, but that could never stop him from pursuing it.Like an eagle scouring the wilderness, he set off on his hunt for the truth. Determination burned like fire in his heart, unfathomable enigmas and unending battles could not sway him from his course. He pressed on relentlessly, scarred but undeterred, like a fiery tornado burning through the dense fog of mystery.The Fatui's rulers, Eleven Fatui Harbingers the Harbingers, monitored Diluc's progress from the shadows. The prowess with which he laid waste to numerous Fatui strongholds caught their attention and forced them to take action.Diluc narrowly escaped death at the hands of the Harbingers thanks to a third-party observer from the north, who was part of a vast underground intelligence network. The observer claimed to have been watching Diluc for some time, and approved of his methods.After his close encounter with death, Diluc took a long hard look at his past and the anger he had harbored for so long. Acknowledging his shortcomings, he decided to join the underground intelligence network.Just like when he first joined the Knights of Favonius, Diluc committed himself fully to his work. His talents and skills saw him rise steadily through the ranks into the upper echelons of the network.The network was made up of volunteers, and many of its members had willingly given up their prior positions and reputations to join. Some had even abandoned their names.Could working with these new comrades finally restore the faith he once clung to? The faith that had been all but destroyed in the events surrounding his father's death?
"Shine True." The background to this motto is hotly contested, but to Diluc it has one simple, clear meaning."Evil cannot go unpunished.Never settle for mediocrity. Never forget that the dawn will one day come."Diluc's solitary sojourn lasted for three years.Four years on, Diluc had returned to Mondstadt and taken over as head of the family winery, now a young man.In the space of these four years, Eroch had been purged from the Knights of Favonius after being shown to be a traitor, while Grand Master Varka had left on an expedition, leaving Master Jean to assume the role of Acting Grand Master.The return of the Dawn Winery's master should have been a momentous occasion for Mondstadt, but strangely it went completely unnoticed.The reason? Mondstadt's citizens were far too busy pondering the mysterious case of an unknown "Guardian of Mondstadt."All that was known about the anonymous guardian was that the smell of burning would follow in his wake, and that a flash of red flames would reveal his silhouette for but a moment in the darkness of the night, before he disappeared in an instant.The bodies of monsters that had plagued Mondstadt for an age now lay dead in the wilderness... Mondstadt's most wanted thieves suddenly appeared bound and gagged, hanging from their feet in the statue plaza... All the Knights of Favonius were dispatched to reckon, once and for all, with the Abyss Mage behind countless crimes in the city, but they arrived only to discover that he had long since been killed...Aided by wine-fueled conversations, word of the mysterious guardian spread swiftly, and he came to be known as the "Darknight Hero."In public, Diluc appeared to hold this hero in contempt, his face curling up in disgust every time the name was uttered.Elzer of the Mondstadt Wine Guild was one of the select few who was in the know, and once queried Diluc about this: Was his disapproval of the Darknight Hero just an act, intended to throw the knights off his trail and protect his anonymity?But Diluc simply frowned once more, and curtly replied: "It's just a stupid name."
Diluc may hold the whole wine industry in the palm of his hand, but he himself is not fond of wine.At Diluc's request, the Dawn Winery developed several alcohol-free beverages, a decision which was met with resounding approval from those in Mondstadt who could not drink alcohol but still wanted to partake in the drinking culture.One of those alcohol-free beverages is Mondstadt's Apple Cider apple cider vinegar, the success of which is on a par with dandelion wine in terms of monthly sales volumes.Some think that Diluc must have such high standards when it comes to wine that he is never seen drinking the mediocre-quality beverages that are available to the public.Others think that drinking wine must surely remind him of his father, and that that is why he does not touch it.When pressed about his drinking habits, he responds by saying that alcohol clouds his thoughts, and consuming it would impact his day-to-day work.But the thing that people don't understand is: What kind of day-to-day work does a winery master do, if it requires him to never touch a drop of alcohol?
Crepus had two regrets in life. One was never becoming a knight, and the other was never obtaining a Vision.For this reason, in the moment that Diluc received his Vision, he took it as a recognition by the gods of his and his father's shared ambition - finally, he could make his father proud.Just a few years later, his father died on a dark and gloomy day. The hopes and dreams that burned bright in Diluc's Vision were extinguished in the torrential rain that fell on that night.No matter how upright and good-hearted a person may be, death will still come to them without warning.Is this where the tale of justice ends? Just like that?It seemed to him that his Vision and his status as a knight were both equally ineffectual at enabling him to protect the things that he treasured most. It was time to discard them both, he decided.When he recognized his own powerlessness, his Vision became but a burden, of no greater service than a Delusion.Empty titles were of no interest to him. He sought after ardent flames that would burn brighter than any other, and an unshakable resolve. Only a firm resolve can drive the truth-seeker forward, and only ardent flames can vanquish the ice that freezes the hand of justice.On the day that Diluc returned to Mondstadt, he took up his Vision once more. The events of his years away had purged him of his childish immaturity, and turned him into a hero ready to shoulder his father's will once more. Each night, from the shadows, he fought for Mondstadt.He did not discuss the past. But he did not deny the past, either.To the lost, perhaps a Vision is a beacon of light given by the gods to help them find the path forward.But to those with conviction, a Vision is simply an extension of their strength, a medium for channeling their willpower, a tribute to the experiences that have shaped them, and a testament to the story of their life so far.

Walkthrough
Use the Wind-Blessed Harpastum to break one of the Dodo-King's painted walls at the bottom of the island. This will lead to a cave entrance, and inside one can observe the Broken Isle Mural as part of the quest 'The Other Side of Isle and Sea'.
There are 5 lakes located at the peaks of the island. For each lake, there will be two rock pedals that can be used to raise and lower the water level. There are 3 water levels (1 being empty, 2 being middle, 3 being full). The mural tells which level each lake should be at.
* South Lake: Level 1
* Southwest Lake: Level 3, one needs to break the Hydro Elemental Amber to fill the lake first
* Northwest Lake: Level 2
* Southeast Lake: Level 2
* Northeast Lake: Level 1, one needs to break the Rock Pile to get a waterfall to fill the lake. Elemental Sight can help locate such breakable rocks. This lake can be easily accessed from the southeast lake by activating the Windmill Mechanism to ride a Wind Current leading here.
After setting the lakes to the correct levels, head to the 5 pillars located at the north of the island. In front of the pillars there will be 5 rock pedals. The player will have to step on these pedals in a specific order. Each pillar will be marked with a number of stripes from 1 to 5. These tell the order to step on the pedals:
#South pedal
#Southwest pedal
#Northeast pedal
#Northwest pedal
#Southeast pedal
After doing this correctly, three Chests (one Luxurious and two Precious) will spawn. There will be a cutscene, and some steel drum music will play. Paimon will say some dialogue too.
* The tune played by stepping on the pedals in the correct order matches the high tide alarm that plays at the beginning of Echoing Tales Story VII Island Bygones - Incoming Tide in the Chinese audio. It is also a simplified version of the cutscene music, which is the beginning of one of the OSTs that plays during the day on the isle.
* If the lake is not filled with water, then there will be no tune when stepping on the pedals.

<text>the furnishing its clones Canine Bunshin the event boss Dilapidated Old House
Kageroumaru is a Canine Bunshin and Furnishing item that can be used in the Serenitea Pot. He can be placed either indoors or outdoors.
One copy of Kageroumaru is obtained after completing Bantan Sango Case File: Recognition during the Bantan Sango Case Files: The Warrior Dog event.
Unlike the other Animal animals in the Serenitea Pot, Kageroumaru does not flee when attacked. Instead, he deflects them with his tantō in his mouth.
History
Kageroumaru is a ninken, a dog trained to be a ninja's companion. When he was young, he was weak and behaved noticeably differently compared to other dogs trained by his clan, which caused him to be left out when ninja arrived to make contracts with their ninken. Kageroumaru's trainer refused to give up on him, and continued to train him to grow stronger. During this time, he had no wish to make a contract with any ninja.
However, due to being occupied with urgent expeditions from the Police Station, Kageroumaru's trainer became unable to take care of him and left behind a letter for any future adopters in Higi Village.Bantan Sango Case File: Recognition Due to the leaking of Tatarigami on the island by fanatic Orobashi zealots, the village was mostly abandoned and no one came for him.
Following a series of missing animal cases, the Bantan Sango Detective Agency put a commission with the Adventurers' Guild for assistance as Ryuuji was knocked out by what he believed was a dog when he saw the animals. This caught the Traveler's attention, who were able to rescue the animals. Kageroumaru later spotted the Traveler and Ryuuji rescuing one of the stolen animals from the Treasure Hoarders and became more friendly, leading them to a Dilapidated Old House and challenged the Traveler to a fight. The Traveler bested Kageroumaru, who then happily barked; Ryuuji interpreted it as Kageroumaru agreeing to become the Traveler's ninken despite them not being a ninja. Returning to the agency, Sango believed that Kageroumaru had been trying to train the animals to protect themselves, something which he implied to agree with another bark.
Profile
Personality
Kageroumaru wished to protect animals and bring out their full potential just like his trainer had done for him. After seeing the Traveler fight off the Treasure Hoarders, he challenged them to test their strength and virtue; after losing to them, he voluntarily became their ninken.

<title>Xiphos</title>
<text>Xiphos was a historical figure in the Great Red Sand, Sumeru.
The crown prince of a long-lost kingdom, Xiphos was saved from his kingdom's destruction by being disguised as a servant. He grew in power and stature, eventually becoming the hero of Tulaytullah, one of the myriad city-states that arose after the fall of King Deshret's kingdom. Due to his reputation, Xiphos was eventually slain by another fallen prince hired by city-states opposed to Tulaytullah.
He was the wielder of Xiphos' Moonlight and the Key of Khaj-Nisut.
Story
Xiphos was born to a queen of one of the myriad kingdoms that were established in the Great Red Sand after King Deshret's kingdom fell. To protect him from their kingdom's destruction, the queen dressed him as a servant and burned his crown and royal clothes, leaving him only with the Key of Khaj-Nisut, one of the scepters which serves as proof that its owner has the right to rule the desert, as proof of his heritage. Before their separation, she told him to '"Use this sword as the key to the paradise's gate, and rebuild the kingdom amidst emeralds and pomegranates."'Key of Khaj-Nisut
After several years of living as a wanderer, Xiphos became apprenticed to the Old Blind Poet who had formerly been a retainer for the desert vassal-kings.Wandering EvenstarMakhaira Aquamarine Xiphos eventually divulged his story to his master, who realized that Xiphos possessed one of the keys to the Eternal Oasis and encouraged him to embark on a journey across the city-states in the desert and reach his destiny of reuniting the desert peoples.
Xiphos, wielding a blade indwelt by a bloodthirsty Jinni, eventually developed a reputation as the hero of Tulaytullah, the city of sapphire and home of the Tighnarians. He saved many maidens from monsters and, in the process, snatched a large amount of treasure from them.Xiphos' Moonlight In some accounts, he was also Makhaira's lover before she was sent as tribute to become a court dancer for Badanah.Tulaytullah's Remembrance Eventually, city-states resentful of Tulaytullah's continued prosperity decided to target Xiphos and hired a wandering foreign mercenary, who himself had fallen from the throne of his homeland, to eliminate Tulaytullah's hero. Some legends claim that the "foreign mercenary" was actually Faramarz, Badanah's son and Makhaira's second lover, who lost his kingdom after it was destabilized by Makhaira's machinations and culminated in his exile by his people.Beacon of the Reed Sea He heard of the story depicting the homeless prince's death, the fate of his swords, and the killer that traversed deep into the forest...Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, Primal Obelisk Khaj-Nisut Khaj-NisutLamp of the LostWhile Faramarz is never directly named as Xiphos' killer, Tulaytullah's Remembrance description states '"The Blade of Tulaytullah met his end at the hands of another exiled princeling, whose banishment had been delivered unto him indeed by that serpent-hearted dancer, the daughter of a Jinni."' In Makhaira Aquamarine's description, Makhaira tells Faramarz that her mother was a Jinni; after they assassinated Badanah, Makhaira destabilized Faramarz's kingdom by aligning herself with various people who vied for the throne. This led him to assassinate her, only to be exiled by his people. Both Beacon of the Reed Sea and Xiphos' Moonlight's descriptions also state that Xiphos' killer went to the rainforest after the deed, which aligns with Faramarz's later fate. However, Beacon of the Reed Sea explicitly states beforehand that its stories have diverted from the truth over time and neither Lamp of the Lost nor Wandering Evenstar, which focus on Faramarz's story after venturing into the rainforest, suggest that he ever worked as a desert mercenary.
In the ensuing duel, Xiphos was slain, cutting his journey short while his killer left the desert for the rainforest. The Key of Khaj-Nisut was lost amidst the desert and in the span of a few years, Tulaytullah fell, with only its garden remaining as the domain Garden of Endless Pillars.Garden of Endless Pillars

Rostam was the close friend and rival of the Grand Master of the time, Arundolyn, the mentor of the Bloodstained Knight,Defender's WillBloodstained Chivalry and the lover of Rosalyne-Kruzchka Lohefalter. Arundolyn and Rosalyne were greatly affected by Rostam's untimely demise during the cataclysm 500 years ago.
Rostam is the central character of the artifact set Defender's Will and partially narrates the description for Elegy for the End.
Profile
Rostam was friends and rivals with Arundolyn, forging a bond strong enough that, after he was slain in battle, Arundolyn never entered combat again out of grief. He was in mutual love with Rosalyne-Kruzchka Lohefalter. later known as the Crimson Witch of Flame and after that, joining the Fatui as the Eighth of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers, La Signora.

<title>Cooldown</title>
<text>the talent cooldown the cooldown on elemental application Internal Cooldown
Cooldown (CD) refers to the time it takes for an Elemental Skill, Elemental Burst, or other ability (like Waverider cannons) to be used again.
Cooldown can be reduced via the Anemo Impetuous Winds Elemental Resonance and certain Character abilities. Certain CD Increase Enemies enemies like the Abyss Herald: Wicked Torrents also have the ability to manipulate the players' cooldown. The Slowing Water Ley Line Disorder can also prolong the cooldown of characters' skills.
The cooldowns for many character's skills are fixed, but in rare cases it may vary depending on how long the ability was used; examples include Tartaglia's Foul Legacy: Raging Tide and Sayu's Yoohoo Art: Fuuin Dash.
CD Reduction
Cooldown reduction is a percentage decrease on the cooldowns after using your Elemental Skill or Elemental Burst before you can use them again. For example, if your Elemental Skill normally has a cooldown of 10 seconds, and you have 10% cooldown reduction, your skill can be used every 9 seconds.
The Reduce CD attribute stacks additively and is affected by any effect that reduces all cooldowns, but any effects that reduce cooldowns of particular talents will stack multiplicatively.
For example, if Bennett
* is in a party with the Anemo Impetuous Winds Elemental Resonance (5% cooldown reduction)
* and stands in the Chonghua Frost Field from a constellation-level-2 Chongyun's Elemental Skill (15% cooldown reduction)
then he will have a Reduce CD of 20%. Furthermore, if Bennett is at ascension level 4 or higher (and thus has all of his Passive Talents unlocked), his Elemental Skill...
* gains a 20% cooldown reduction
* and gains another 50% reduction while he stands in his Elemental Burst's AoE.
Thus, if he uses his skill while inside both his burst and Chongyun's skill, its base cooldown of 5 seconds will be reduced to 5 seconds × (1−0.2) × (1−0.2) × (1−0.5) = 1.6 seconds. (Bennett's Reduce CD stat will still be 20%, since his Passive Talents affects only his skill-not all cooldowns.)
Character Switching Cooldown
The character switching cooldown limits how often a character can be switched. By default, this cooldown is one second. This cooldown can be manipulated by event status effects, such as those in the Perilous Trail (Event) Perilous Trail event.

Elemental Bursts
Elemental Burst Comparison
Enemy Cooldowns
Enemies also have cooldowns for their skills.
Enemies have 5 separate cooldown timers for their skills. A skill can only be used if all 5 cooldown timers have reached 0. The 5 cooldowns are respectively Regular Cooldown, Initial Cooldown, Local Shared Cooldown, Global Shared Cooldown, and Action Interval.NGA:
* Regular Cooldown starts after an enemy skill ends. This cooldown is typically randomly determined within a Cooldown Range, but fixed cooldowns also exist for some enemy skills.
** For example, Maguu Kenki's Pushing Mask attack has a Cooldown Range of 10-15 seconds.
* Initial Cooldown starts after an enemy enters combat or enters the state required by the ability. This cooldown determines the amount of time required to pass for a skill to be performed for the first time. Not all skills have an Initial Cooldown.
** For example, the Ruin Guard's Spin attack has an Initial Cooldown Range of 30-60 seconds.
* Local Shared Cooldown is a cooldown shared between multiple skills of the same enemy, typically to prevent enemies from performing multiple similar attacks in a row.
** For example, the Perpetual Mechanical Array's Rocket Blast, Combo 1 (Sword Slash + Rocket Blast) and Combo 2 (Blade Spin + Sword Slash + Rocket Blast) all share a Local Shared Cooldown of 10 seconds.
* Global Shared Cooldown is applied to certain skills when multiple enemies of the same type are present. Global Shared Cooldown is the only type of cooldown that starts as soon as a skill is initiated instead of after the skill finishes.
** For example, when the Perpetual Mechanical Array enters Defensive Mode, the following can be observed:
*** If the Ruin Cruiser performs Orb Lay, the Ruin Defender will not immediately perform Leap.
*** If the Ruin Cruiser does not perform Orb Lay, the Ruin Defender will likely perform Leap.
*** This is due to the aforementioned two enemy skills sharing the same Global Shared Cooldown.
** Note that Global Shared Cooldown will be ignored if two enemies attack at the exact same time.
* Action Interval is a cooldown shared between all skills of a single enemy which ensures that enemies do not chain attacks too rapidly. Action Interval is typically 1-3 seconds depending on the enemy.
** Some skills do not trigger Action Interval, such as the Abyss Herald: Wicked Torrents' Tidal Slash Combo. Such skills can be immediately followed up by another skill.
** Some skills ignore Action Interval, such as the Abyss Herald: Wicked Torrents' backstep. Such skills can be used to immediately follow up another skill, even if the Action Interval timer has not reached 0.
Enemy CD Reduction
The buff provided by Electro Elemental Nodes reduces the Regular Cooldown, Initial Cooldown, and Local Shared Cooldown of enemy skills. Global Shared Cooldown and Action Interval are not affected.</text>

<title>Hilichurls</title>
<text>Hilichurlian
Primitive humanoid monsters that can be found all across Teyvat.Most people have already given up on trying to communicate with the hilichurls, believing that they are monsters simply incapable of communication.
Hilichurls are a goblin-like family of monsters in 'Genshin Impact', and are one of the first enemy family types the player will encounter early in the game.
Description
Regardless of what stage of growth they are currently at, all Hilichurls are bare-chested and bare-footed, and have a large mane covering most of their head. They appear to have two elongated ears sticking out of their mane. The only clothing they wear is a loincloth, while their arms and legs are loosely wrapped in bandages. Every Hilichurl wears a mask, as to prevent themselves from seeing their own hideous faces in reflections. While elementally-affiliated Hilichurls, such as Samachurls, Hilichurl Rogues and Lawachurls take on the color of their element, their skin is naturally of a grayish-black hue.
Elementally affiliated hilichurls, Samachurls and Lawachurls also take on the element's appropriate color for both their skin and masks. Despite their general hostility towards outsiders or humans and a less than optimal lifestyle, Hilichurls are also intelligent for their standards, as a few use tools and Slimes, scavenge and even engage in agriculture, albeit limited to raising livestock due to the race's general dislike of vegetables. They have a fairly impressive, albeit archaic architectural style, the construction or purpose of them unknown.
As a hilichurl grows and survives, they eventually turn into Mitachurls, who are larger and bulkier. Mitachurls that continue to grow and survive eventually accumulate an excess of the elemental energy in their area, turning them into Lawachurls. It is not known how long it takes for this growth to occur.
Some hilichurls may instead go rogue; unlike other hilichurls, these rogues are not part of a tribe, instead wandering around Teyvat for an unknown reason. However, they may occasionally help other hilichurl tribes for a short time before leaving. These hilichurls are larger, being of a similar height to a mitachurl, and are also said to be intelligent for hilichurl standards.
They appear to not have an archon or god governing them, rather relying on the most strongest and ferocious among them to lead the tribe. Most tribes also have Samachurls who act as the spiritual leaders of the group. The Lawachurls whose name is derived from the Hilichurlian way of respectfully addressing a king or ruler are revered by younger Hilichurls due to their strength. Despite their status as a role model or "king" for the smaller hierarchy, most Lawachurls prefer solitude.
Hilichurls appear to have a reliable social network, as some Hilichurls are friends with others across vast distances.Mimi Tomo Like humans, Hilichurls can live in a myriad of environments and acclimate themselves accordingly.
Many Hilichurls are also affiliated with the Abyss Order, as the Abyss Mages are able to speak fluent Hilichurlian. Unlike humans, who usually have to rely on a Vision or science to manipulate the elements, some Hilichurls are naturally capable of doing so, such as the samachurls - why or how is unknown. That said, Hilichurls typically stay away from areas with high elemental concentrations, as it places a great burden on their body.Hurdle

Tribes
While Hilichurls can be found all over Teyvat, some of them in small tribes, there are three prominent tribes, all of whom can be found in Dadaupa Gorge. A tribe's composition tends to vary, usually containing a large amount of normal hilichurls. Most tribes also have Samachurls, who are the oldest of the Hilichurls and often lead the tribes.
Some tribes may not have Samachurls, which is the result of younger, stronger members overthrowing them. These tribes are most likely led by Mitachurls and are far more aggressive. Even fewer tribes are led by Lawachurls, as the few that are around prefer solitude and dislike the reverence the younger members give them.
Sleeper Tribe
The Sleeper Tribe Hilichurls are known for napping whenever possible. Due to their emphasis on sleeping, the Sleeper Tribe is rumored to have extremely soft animal-skin beds.
Meaty Tribe
The Meaty Tribe Hilichurls are known for making sacrifices on a regular basis. They pray for meat every day and highly value strength. Apart from building huge altars, they possess a massive cooking pot and a huge arena for members of the tribe to spar.
Eclipse Tribe
The Hilichurls of the Eclipse Tribe are said to be extremely mysterious; all Hilichurls of that tribe know how to draw an eclipse symbol. It is rumored that the Dada Samachurls of this tribe know the reasoning behind this.
Lore
It is heavily implied that hilichurls were once human beings who were cursed by the Gods for "sinning." While the punishment of the Gods could take many forms (such as immortality), this particular affliction is known as the "curse of wilderness," which causes people to transform into monsters and grants them an unnaturally prolonged life. Given that the Hilichurls' existence has been known for over a thousand years, it is likely they originate from the many ancient civilizations that once thrived on Teyvat before their eventual demise in various catastrophic events across Teyvat's history. In particular, their presence has increased since the cataclysm occurring 500 years ago,Hilichurl coinciding with the destruction of the ancient human civilization of Khaenri'ah. In fact, Dainsleif confirms that the hilichurls encountered in the Chasm are actually former citizens of Khaenri'ah,The Grave of the GuardedAfter Dainsleif explains that the effect of the curse he had been suffering from ever since the cataclysm seems to be weakened while near the Inverted City, the Traveler can ask Dainsleif, "The hilichurls that come here are also from..." Dainsleif's response is, "Indeed. Do you know why hilichurls wear masks? [...] It's to hide their appearance, lest they catch sight of their reflection in a body of water... Compared to how they remember themselves, it is a terrible sight to behold, one that causes them great despair." after which the Traveler replies, "So these hilichurls really are from..." Although the Traveler left the place of origin of the hilichurls found in The Chasm unsaid, this conversation strongly implies that they are from Khaenri'ah. and Chlothar Alberich further reveals that those who were not "pure-blood Khaenri'ahns" were the ones that turned into monsters.Fortune-Mocking Pedigree
Due to the curse, memories of their former life are gradually forgotten, as well as most semblances of humanity they once had. Their intelligence and behavior are gradually degraded, and they can no longer speak nor understand the common language of Teyvat. Despite all this, Hilichurls still seem to be capable of at least some rudimentary self-awareness and emotion. For instance, they still recall what it was like to have a human face, as the reason they wear masks to hide their true countenance is because they cannot stand the mental anguish of seeing their own hideous reflections in a body of water.Requiem of the Echoing Depths
Although most Hilichurls are incapable of human speech and intelligence, it is possible to reverse parts of the curse, such as when Caribert (NPC) Caribert was able to speak again after being imbued with the power of the abyss from the statue of the Sinner.Caribert Moreover, in Fontaine, Narzissenkreuz was able to give an Anemo Hilichurl Rogue sentience, granting him both a "human" form and the ability to speak and understand human language, giving him the name Caterpillar.Caterpillar
Hilichurls are unable to truly die a natural death on account of their immortality; as they grow older, their physical bodies and mental state erode to the point that is like 'death'. Because of this, aged Hilichurls are in a state of perpetual agony. However, Hilichurls seem to know that they are cursed and are also somehow aware of the properties of an area in The Chasm (Subregion) The Chasm that can temporarily assuage the effects of their curse. Therefore, some Hilichurls instinctively venture to this region when they want to 'die' - ignoring all bodily needs of food or defense, and desiring nothing else than to waste away with at least some semblance of comfort.

<title>Irminsul</title>
<text>Irminsul is a type of silver-white tree which grows deep underground, and is connected to the Ley Lines of the world. It is said that the Dendro Archon's consciousness is directly connected to it,YouTube: '' and that it itself is the root of Dendro power.Lost in Prosperity
Overview
Irminsul is the repository for all of the information and memories of Teyvat, which are collected via the Ley Lines.Chronic Illness It is unclear exactly how the repository works, as there is no information on the Traveler in Irminsul by the end of Chapter III even though many people in Teyvat know of them. However, the Traveler seems to correctly understand how the repository works.
In Teyvat, Irminsul is connected to Petrified Trees (Domains), Ley Line Outcrops and Ley Line Blossoms, which can be revitalized with Original Resin or Condensed Resin.Original ResinCondensed Resin Irminsul's roots also pierce through the surface in a few select areas of Teyvat.
Tighnari states that Irminsul grows downwards rather than upwards, from a cavern located deep underground, and that Ley Lines - described as the roots of Irminsul - spread and extend from the cavern all the way to the surface. Judging from this description, any part of Irminsul that reaches the surface is presumably the very ends of the tree's roots. It's possible that Irminsul itself is located either in or near the abyss, given how branches of Irminsul can be found there,Prototype Crescent "In the end, he chose to use cudrania wood, fine steel and Irminsul branches brought back from the abyss." and branches would typically be found after falling from/breaking from a tree.
Modifications
Irminsul/Modifications
Information is normally added to Irminsul via the Ley Lines, which continually absorb the world's memories. Those who are not from the world of Teyvat do not have records in Irminsul.The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call Individuals who can connect to Irminsul can directly access the information stored in its repository.
Information can be purged from Irminsul. Doing so removes all traces of that information from Teyvat as it originally existed. The purging of information requires power on the level of a god. Beings, including gods, can be purged, but a being cannot successfully remove itself entirely from Irminsul.
To accommodate the loss of information, anything that belongs to the world of Teyvat may be changed, ranging from people's memories to physical objects such as books and letters. However, the overall results and overarching historical impacts remain unchanged. Those who belong to the world of Teyvat, including the Archons, can have their impressions of Teyvat's history altered; they will be unaware of any such changes. Notably, Paimon is also affected.A Toast to VictoryWhere the Boat of Consciousness Lies
Steps can be taken to ensure that lost information is preserved or retrieved, such as abstracting information in a way such that the information "still resonates with the present information recorded in Irminsul."The Kabukimono's Finale The successful preservation and retrieval of information that is purged from Irminsul is presumably difficult to do without the aid of someone who never lost that information, such as the Traveler. To this end, much information could have been purged from Irminsul without anyone remembering (apart from other Descenders) prior to the Traveler's arrival in Teyvat.
If the information removed is that of an entire being, then the consequences of their actions and existence remain in the world. For example, the rainforests of Sumeru created by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata remained after she was purged from Irminsul, and the history of the tradition of forest dwellers offering Rukkhashava Mushrooms to Sumeru Akademiya was preserved even though it is implied through the updated Archive description that the reason behind the Akademiya's receipt of Rukkhashava Mushrooms no longer exists. In addition, immediately following Nahida's removal of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, Nahida still felt sad even though she only remembered that she had just successfully removed the pollution from Irminsul. Later, Nahida is also able to tell that she was once supported by a certain "warmth" that is implied to be Greater Lord Rukkhadevata or her memory.Dream of Farewell In addition, after Scaramouche attempted to purge himself from Irminsul, the Traveler personally verifies that the consequences of all that he did still remained, but for different reasons or with different actors.A Dance of Destruction
The removal of information appears to only happen once. Removed information that is preserved or retrieved by those who belong to Teyvat does not disappear again.
Unlike item descriptions, Weapon and Artifact descriptions seem to be immune to changes in Irminsul's repository.When Greater Lord Rukkhadevata and Scaramouche were removed from Irminsul, there were some clearly erroneous persistent references to them that were later fixed to reflect their removals. No such changes have occurred for Weapons or Artifacts. Of particular note is the Artifact Set Husk of Opulent Dreams, the entirety of which details Scaramouche's life such that a hypothetical update to that set would entail a total overhaul of all five artifact descriptions. Presumably, they exist solely for players.
Notable Parts of Irminsul
This is a list of parts of Irminsul's roots that players can find in the current version of Teyvat, referred to as "withered trees" by Paimon due to their appearance (although they could also be referred to as "Petrified Trees", "Irminsul Trees" or "Irminsul Roots").
Their wood is silver-white colored with glowing blue streaks running throughout. The areas where these roots are located also all seem to have strong Ley Line disorders which change the surroundings in various ways, likely connected to the presence of the roots. Interestingly, the locations of these withered trees are also all in the same locations that Divine Nails are implied to have once landed.</text>

<title>The Doctor</title>
<text>The Doctor, also known as Il Dottore and Zandik, is the Second of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers.Like a Triumphant Hero
He first appears in the manga, set some time before the game's story, as a diplomat to Mondstadt. In present day, he makes an appearance during '' alongside his fellow Harbingers. He makes his in-game debut (in his Omega Build) during Archon Quest Chapter III, Act III, where he is revealed to be working with the sages of Sumeru Akademiya.
Profile
Dottore's unfettered research towards creating a god, or elevating humans to the level of gods, left him ostracized from mainstream society but paved the way for him to become one of the most powerful members of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers, with strength comparable to the gods'.A Toast to Victory No subject is off-limits to him, and he has researched Khaenri'ah's Automatons; researched ways to weaponize forbidden knowledge (via The Withering and Eleazar); and sought to utilize the power of dreams to elevate humanity's cognitive abilities, all for his goal of putting humans at the same level as gods. This ambition is likely the reason why Pantalone, who seeks to "overthrow the natural imbalance between gods and humans," works closely with Dottore.
Pursuing his research interests surpasses any of Dottore's moral scruples, which makes him an effective researcher but also often comes at the detriment of others. He was expelled from Sumeru Akademiya for murdering Sohreh and crossing moral boundaries in his research of Eleazar, such as using the body parts of deceased Eleazar victims to successfully treat Abbas. Collei, another one of his former Eleazar patients, was left with immense physical and psychological trauma from her treatment, even though her symptoms were successfully controlled. Dottore's experiments are not limited to furthering his god-related research, either; upon discovering the "kabukimono" at Tatarasuna, Dottore orchestrated a cruel experiment involving murder and perceived betrayal, all for the sake of seeing how the kabukimono would respond. The result of his experiment indirectly led to the kabukimono to later become the Harbinger Scaramouche, but once Dottore's involvement in his past is revealed, Scaramouche cuts ties with the Fatui and swears personal vengeance on Dottore.
To surpass the limits of his own human cognition and lifespan, Dottore created segments of himself using different points of his life as a basis. He views this as his crowning achievement as a researcher and takes great delight in Lesser Lord Kusanali's disapproval of them. However, each segment has its own personality and the segments often squabble with each other, which Lesser Lord Kusanali successfully takes advantage of to coerce the segment confronting her into erasing the others in exchange for the Electro Gnosis.Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies
Appearance
So far, Dottore's segments shown in the manga and in-game are of an adult man with red eyes, wavy blue hair, and pale skin. Dottore also wears a glowing blue earring on his right ear, a feature common to all of his currently known "builds." Sohreh describes him as "young" and "handsome"
In the manga, Dottore sports short and curly hair, and wears a long white coat over a white dress shirt and a pink bow tie. Under this he wears a pinstriped vest and dark pants. He typically wears a black and white mask covering all of his face save his right cheek and half of his mouth. The Fatui symbol can be seen at the top left corner of this mask.
Dottore's Omega Build, seen in 'A Winter Night's Lazzo' and in the Sumeru Archon Quests, has longer hair and wears a pointed, beak-shaped black mask that covers his eyes.
Dottore is also able to take on completely different appearances, posing as a mechanic from Fontaine named Escher during 'The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call'. During this quest, he wears Fontaine clothing and a belt with a knife in a scabbard attached on it located behind his back.
Story
History
Pre-Fatui Life
Since his youth, Dottore, then known as Zandik, had an obsession with creating "enhanced humans" that could surpass even the gods. It is unknown if this ambition was what  got him chased out of his hometown and accused of being a "monster" and a "madman" after he was admitted into Sumeru Akademiya.  His Darshan is not mentioned, apart from explicitly excluding him from Amurta. Most of his actions during that time are recorded in the 'Zandik's Legacy' series of interactables, which relates heavily to Ardravi Valley's lore.
Zandik once took part of an expedition to the ancient desert city of Gurabad, where he encountered machines and technology he believed to be made by civilization not under the rule of The Seven. However, the "Gurabad samples," as he called them, were fragmented and incomplete, leaving him few leads to continue researching.Interactable: Zandik's Legacy, Zandik's Legacy Ancient Work Log Ancient Work LogInteractable: Zandik's Legacy, Zandik's Legacy Akademiya Investigation Team's Interim Report Akademiya Investigation Team's Interim Report
He then took part in an Ardravi Valley expedition as a trainee Dastur, where he discovered many pieces that were missing from the Gurabad samples. He believed that he would be able to repair the machine's automatic system with these parts. During this time, he also discovered the records left behind by the Schwanenritter (which the Traveler can themselves uncover as well), and tied them back to the legends about the Ruins of Dahri.
While exploring the jungle, Zandik was partnered with a Dastur named Sohreh. Although she initially found him "rigid" and bemoaned that his research style clashed too much with Amurta's for them to have anything to talk about, they eventually made conversation about local plants and animals. Sohreh describes it as "a great time," and her note ends with a remark about how they would go on a picnic together later that night.Interactable: Zandik's Legacy Sohreh's Note Sohreh's Note
What happened next is unclear. The next record involving them is the Ragged Attendance Record, which states that Zandik had "acted without authorization for the third time." The record goes on to list a gravely injured Sohreh, who was ostensibly attacked by Rishboland Tigers.Interactable: Zandik's Legacy Ragged Attendance Records Ragged Attendance Records Soon after, the team was attacked by a killing machine which Zandik disabled with his quick thinking. However, his desire to bring it back to the Akademiya for disassembly and reverse-engineering was rebuked by his peers and teachers. As punishment, Sage Sharnama delisted him from the author list of the paper that the expedition had been writing. During this time, Sohreh died and was buried.Interactable: Zandik's Legacy Sumeru Investigation Team's Note Sumeru Investigation Team's Note
At some point, Sohreh's remains were exhumed and dissected to verify her cause of death. Despite the lacerations and hemorrhaging, the actual fatal injury was a fractured Hyoid bone Clinical significance hyoid bone - which suggested she had died from strangulation, not from lacerations or blood loss like the rest of the Investigation Team was led to believe. The coroner could not reach a conclusion as to her actual cause of death.Interactable: Zandik's Legacy Dissection Records Dissection Records
At an unknown point in time, Zandik was also involved in some sort of medical research related to Eleazar in Apam Woods, recorded in some Ragged Records. The lab's child subjects all disappeared mysteriously, which Zandik believed was the result of interference by the Aranara, a ley line/elemental creature with the power to control dreams. This led him to conclude that by capturing and controlling the Aranara, human intelligence could be "elevated [...] to a whole new level," and humanity could "transcend the earthly boundaries."Interactable: Zandik's Legacy Ragged Records Ragged Records He also participated in Eleazar research in Dar al-Shifa, in which he successfully managed to cure an Eleazar patient named Abbas by using "materials" procured from the remains of other deceased patients.Eleazar Hospital Notes Abbas, however, was deeply scarred by his treatment and eventually dug his way out of the hospital out of sheer desperation.Abbas' Escape
Investigators at the Akademiya grew suspicious of Zandik. The results of Sohreh's autopsy suggested she had been murdered at his hands, and certain records went missing.Akademiya Public Message Board Zandik He was eventually expelled from the Akademiya,A Time of Insight something he considered a loss despite the rejection he faced from his peers and teachers, as he needed "an environment conducive to research."
Fatui Involvement
After his expulsion, Zandik was approached by Pierro, who invited him to become part of the Fatui with the promise of resources for his research. He agreed, and was given the title of Il Dottore, or The Doctor - which he found humorously ironic.
Under Dottore's guidance, the Fatui performed research related to Eleazar, a disease only found in Sumeru. Collei was given to them for treatment and underwent painful and traumatic experiments with gods' remains, which was effective in suppressing Eleazar's effects but left her traumatized and afflicted with other symptoms.Chronic Illness Those symptoms went away after Cyno sealed away the gods' remains.
Dottore also infiltrated Tatarasuna under Pierro's orders to sabotage the Mikage Furnace as part of their plans for Inazuma in the future. Using the alias Escher, he supplied the furnace with materials that soon caused it to go critical. Niwa Hisahide, Armory Officer of the Mikage Furnace, was forced to head inside to fix it, but before he could do so, Dottore killed him and removed his heart, putting it into a box that the kabukimono later known as Scaramouche would take to cleanse the Furnace. When the puppet opened the box, he found a withered heart inside; Dottore lied that the heart was from an innocent servant whom Niwa had killed before fleeing. Niwa's apparent betrayal of the puppet and the people of Tatarasuna left the puppet enraged and disgusted. Dottore and Pierro both showed interest in the puppet, believing he would be of use to the Fatui.The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call
At some point after Diluc's departure from Mondstadt and before the events of the manga's main story, Dottore single-handedly defeated Ursa the Drake and made Mondstadt indebted to the Fatui. Dottore began recruiting vulnerable targets in Mondstadt, luring them to the Fatui only to use them as test subject for his and his subordinates' human experiments. He also began setting up an unknown project in Mondstadt, which he intended to check up on while attending Ludi Harpastum. It is unclear whether Dottore had a hand in the events surrounding Diluc's 18th birthday, such as giving Crepus a Delusion, luring Ursa the Drake to attack Crepus and Diluc's caravan, or being involved with the Knights of Favonius traitor Eroch.
When Scaramouche joined the Fatui, Dottore modified him to unlock his power, and he even gained abilities beyond what Ei had originally given him.Wishes (Quest) After several decades of studying the methods used to create Scaramouche, Dottore decided to create segments of himself at different ages in order to gain the perspectives from his various stages of life. These segments are created with rare materials and are time-consuming to produce, making them highly valuable to him.
Manga
Dottore first appears in Haeresys, a Fatui underground arena where Krupp is putting his test subjects into fights against an unknown enemy. After his 139th subject dies, Dottore calls his work "pathetic as usual" and threatens to turn Krupp into one of 'his' test subjects instead. Krupp, desperate to avoid that fate, turns his attention to Mondstadt's invitation to attend Ludi Harpastum.
The two arrived at Diluc's Manor, where Diluc and other prestigious members of Mondstadt high society have gathered. Dottore leaves most of the talk to Krupp, only speaking to express his disdain for the people of Mondstadt. He stalks off after Diluc delays the negotiations, but returns to silence Krupp when the "Darknight Hero" (a disguised Diluc) is about to interrogate him. Bemused by the boy's abilities, Dottore leaves, telling him to get stronger.
No longer interested in Mondstadt, he drops the negotiations, orders his diplomats to withdraw, and returns to Haeresys first. He does, however, reclaim Krupp's corpse to transform him into a Ruin Hunter-like monster. After learning of the Black Fire incident instigated by Collei, which left two of his diplomats dead, he expresses complete apathy towards the matter and leaves it to his subordinate Barnabas.
He reappears in Chapter 16, where he expresses annoyance that the guards were incompetent enough to let the captured "Darknight Hero" escape, while Barnabas was severely wounded in the aftermath of his attack on Collei and Amber.
In-Game
At some point before 'Mighty Cyclops' Adventure!', the Fatui built a Ruin Guard manufacturing facility as part of their research into the Abyss. Tartaglia believes that this facility belonged to Dottore, and the whimsical researcher abandoned the autonomous facility after growing bored with it without shutting it down. This resulted in the manufactured Ruin Guards spreading into the surrounding area, attracting the attention of the Millelith. Towards the end of the Chapter, Tartaglia took his younger brother Teucer there, claiming it was the "Liyue Institute for Toy Research." Over the course of exploring the factory, Tartaglia and the Traveler end up wrecking the facility to keep Teucer safe.Defender of Childhood Dreams
One of Dottore's Segments appears at La Signora's funeral, where Il Capitano presses him on the whereabouts of Scaramouche and the Inazuman Gnosis. Dottore's roundabout answer reveals he is waiting on Scaramouche to make a move first. Meanwhile, the Segment in the prime of Dottore's life is busy conducting an experiment in "blasphemy," which takes the form of burning a massive tree at an unknown location.YouTube:
Learning of the Akademiya's desire to restore their fallen god, Dottore headed to the Akademiya and offered to make them a replacement, which they agreed to. The extent of his assistance to the sages is unknown.
Dottore was also interested in the Aranara, a race of strange mushroom creatures as he was interested in the connection between them, dreams, and The Withering that occurred in Sumeru; Alphonso Trofin Snezhevich believes that he was interested in weaponizing dreams and the Withering for unknown purposes. Aware that only children could see the Aranara, he had the Fatui kidnap children to lure them; however, their powers allowed them to escape the trap and rescue the children at the same time.The Bad Guy in Vimara Village The Farrokhzadan were a group of Eremites hired to help carry Dottore's tasks in Sumeru, although they also failed due to the Traveler's intervention.
At some point in time, the Desert Investigation Expedition Team led by Froderock Fronkonsteen, Dottore's subordinate, was dispatched to the Desert of Hadramaveth with a mission to investigate the current situation with the desert tribes.Rejoice With Me, for What Was Lost Is Now Found They attempted to have dealings with the Tanit tribe, only to be manipulated by its matriarch, Babel.
Dottore makes his first appearance before the Traveler when they, Paimon, and Nahida (in Katheryne's body) attempt to get information on the sages' plans from Setaria. Having foreseen Setaria's wavering loyalties, Dottore and the sages put her in confinement and Dottore set up an ambush. Modifying the Akasha terminals to deposit information into people's minds, Dottore made them think of the Traveler as a great hero, which caused them to swarm the three. To save her people and buy her companions time to escape, Nahida plays her trump card: using her own powers to forcibly control the Akasha terminals and undo the changes which Dottore had affected. However, by doing so, she revealed her true nature to the Harbinger.
Although Nahida initially manages to escape from Dottore, she realizes that his skill in modifying the Akasha meant it was only a matter of time before he would trap her consciousness. Meanwhile, Dottore predicted that the Traveler would attempt to rendezvous with Tighnari, who had turned down the sages' offer to join their project, and sent elite Eremite mercenaries after them. Although the Traveler and Nahida reunite at Pardis Dhyai and discover the sages' true objective - creating a new god in Scaramouche - Dottore succeeds in trapping Nahida's consciousness and his Eremite mercenaries destroy the Katheryne puppet.The Gaze From a Certain God
Dottore later visited Tighnari in order to acquire Haypasia claiming that he would be able to help her, but Tighnari refused, having suspected malevolent intent behind his claim. Having been recalled to the Tsaritsa, he later had a few subordinates stay behind to take her by force, diverting the Traveler and Dehya to Port Ormos. Despite the ruse, his subordinates were defeated and forced to retreat after Scaramouche began pelting the area with thunderbolts with Ei's Gnosis when the Traveler informed him that he was trying to take Haypasia.As by a God's Side
After the Traveler and Nahida defeated Scaramouche, a segment of Dottore confronts Nahida, using a special sound wave to put the Traveler and Paimon to sleep. He then negotiates with her, acquiring Ei's Electro Gnosis in return for destroying the other segments, with some being uncaring while others swore revenge. He also negotiated for her own Dendro Gnosis, after giving her information that the stars and skies were a "lie" before returning to the Tsaritsa.

<title>Dragon of Water</title>
<text>The Dragon of Water, Hydro Sovereign, or the Hydro Dragon, was the ruler of Vishaps with sovereignty over water and one of the Seven Sovereigns.
After the original Dragon of Water disappeared, it reincarnated in human form as Neuvillette.
Story
The original Dragon of Water was one of the Seven Sovereigns, dragon-lords who ruled over the seven nations of the old world.The Byakuyakoku Collection According to Hydro Vishap legend, the Dragon of Water was the "beating heart" that ruled over the Primordial Sea.Wings of Merciful, Wrathful Waters Alongside the other sovereigns, it went to war against the Primordial One and was eventually defeated. Sometime following its defeat, the original Dragon of Water withered away.Primordial Bathysmal Vishap The Primordial One took a portion of each of the dragon sovereigns' power and bestowed it upon the archons.Calamitous Tread
A prophecy in Enkanomiya claimed that a new Dragon of Water will be born in human form as these dragon-lords require a "pure" vessel, and the Bathysmal Vishaps, originally Hydro, had become "impure" when they evolved to harness the powers of Electro and Cryo.Bolteater Bathysmal Vishap HatchlingThe Byakuyakoku CollectionThe Byakuyakoku Collection This prophecy eventually came true, as the Hydro Dragon incarnated in the form of Neuvillette, the Iudex of Fontaine.
According to Freminet, there is a legend that a Dragon of Water once resided in Fontaine, and it is said that every time it weeps, the skies will cloud up and pour out rain; if one would wish for the rain to stop, they should shout "Hydro Dragon, Hydro Dragon, don't cry!" to the skyThe City of Rains and Remembrance This legend is true, as the skies have been shown to rain whenever Neuvillette experiences great grief. Focalors herself during her conversation with Neuvillette also told him "Hydro Dragon, Hydro Dragon, don't cry."The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur
Before the events of The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur took place, none of the dragon sovereigns possessed the level of power they once had, including Neuvillette. As Neuvillette himself was reborn in a human form, he lost a large amount of his memories, such as being unable to remember his connection to the Primordial Sea. While he is able to push back the Primordial Sea's waters, he had less control over them than the original Dragon of Water did. To restore his full dragonhood, Neuvillette would need the Archon to return their elemental Authority to him; however, he believed this solution to be unworkable, as it would require the death of the Hydro Archon. Unbeknownst to him, Focalors had put a plan into a motion to do just that, and she would later meet with Neuvillette and execute herself to return the Hydro Archon's authority to him. With that, Neuvillette regained his predecessor's full power, using it to make the Fontanians fully human and prevent the prophecy from dissolving them.
Upon Furina's abdication from the post of Hydro Archon, the affairs related with the title has been passed on to Neuvillette, with the duties of the Hydro Sovereign and the Iudex now coexisting within his person.Finale Neuvillette has also decided to continue giving out Visions, in recognition of human will.

<title>Krupp</title>
<text>Krupp was a menial who worked for the Fatui as one of Il Dottore's adjutants. He was a character original to the 'Genshin Impact' manga.
Story
Manga
Krupp first appears in the Haeresys, a Fatui underground arena where captured test subjects are used to fight an unknown creature. Displeased by his menial, Dottore calls Krupp's work "pathetic as usual" before threatening to make him into a test subject as well.
Desperate to avoid this fate, Krupp tells Dottore that they have received an invitation to Mondstadt's Ludi Harpastum festival and suggests that they can recruit more test subjects from Mondstadt. Confidently claiming he will get decent results to please his master, the two go to Dawn Winery, where Diluc is holding a party. Inside Dawn Winery, Dottore orders Diluc to bring the Seneschal Seamus Pegg to him, but Diluc expresses unfamiliarity with Dottore. Krupp "humbly" introduces Dottore as his master, telling Diluc about his status as one of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers and the champion who defeated Ursa the Drake. Diluc agrees to let them meet in his manor, but only on the condition that he is allowed to sit in with them; Krupp accepts.
In the manor's meeting chambers, Krupp attempts to convince Kaeya and Seamus Pegg to allow the Fatui to recruit from Mondstadt's populace, saying that every city on the continent has agreed to seek protection from the Fatui and that Mondstadt's youths can become heroes in the Fatui's ranks. However, Kaeya is aware of their intentions and calls out their plan as a "blood tax" paid with the lives of Mondstadt's children. Krupp retorts that he would never call it that. Seamus tries to delay their response until the Varka Grand Master is made aware of the situation, but Krupp demands an immediate answer; Diluc ends the negotiations there and Krupp and Dottore exit the chambers.
In the Winery's manor, Dottore expresses his anger towards Krupp for wasting his time in the meeting chamber, telling Krupp to find a solution after the Knights of Favonius refused their treaty. After Dottore leaves, Krupp briefly ponders stealing a glass of wine before he is interrupted by Kaeya's friendly greeting. Kaeya claims that the Seneschal is considering the Fatui's offer and suggests that he might be more convinced if the deal is made more favorable for Mondstadt.
Krupp is next seen descending into the winery cellar, planning to steal the wine barrels with his guards' help. However, he is ambushed by the "Darknight Hero" (Diluc's secret identity) and realizes it was a trap. Krupp calls his guards and attempts to flee, but Diluc quickly dispatches the guards and captures Krupp using chains conjured by his Delusion. Diluc interrogates him about the missing children from Mondstadt experimented on by the Fatui, and Krupp quickly turns on his master. However, before Krupp can provide any further information about Dottore's plans, Dottore appears and kills Krupp for his ineptitude and breach of confidential information. He walks away, leaving Diluc with Krupp's corpse in the cellar.
Later, Dottore transforms Krupp's corpse into an Automatons Automaton-like monster, and is seen praising it for its combat prowess amidst a field of dead hilichurls. He leaves the monster to run amok in the wilderness. Later, Amber is attacked by the Krupp-automaton after attempting to retrieve a discarded Fatui device from a hilichurl camp, and Jean arrives in time to back her up. Jean defeats the Krupp-automaton once, but it restores itself and chases Amber in pursuit of the device. In the end, Amber and Jean manage to destroy it by baiting it towards the hilichurl camp's explosive barrels and then setting them off.</text>

<title>Claymore</title>
<text>Claymores are one of the five weapon types that characters can use in 'Genshin Impact'.
Claymores restrict the character wielding them to slower hits than other melee weapons like Swords and Polearms, but deal more damage per hit with higher Interruption Resistance interruption capabilities. Due to being considered Blunt Attacks, Claymore attacks deal increased damage to Geo objects and certain Shields.
Normal Attacks
A Claymore user's Normal Attack chain typically consists of 3-5 slow, but powerful and wide, melee attacks.
Charged Attacks
A Claymore user's Charged Attack has a small windup before performing a rapid chain of attack that continuously drains their stamina. This attack will end with a more powerful slash if the attack button is released, if the character runs out of stamina, or if the max duration is reached.
When initiating a Charged Attack sequence from a standstill, Claymore users will cut short the animation of their first Normal Attack and transition it into the Charged Attack windup animation. However, if the first Normal Attack's Attack Speed is too fast, the character will finish performing the first Normal Attack before starting the Charged Attack windup. For example, Sayu who can normally directly enter a Charged Attack sequence from standstill, when at 150% Attack Speed, will have to perform her first Normal Attack before a Charged Attack sequence.
Two iterations of Claymore Charged Attack exist: a spinning attack for the short and medium-height characters and a continuous slash attack for the tall characters, except for Kaveh and Navia, who use the spinning iteration. However, they are functionally the same. Arataki Itto has access to a non-standard Charged Attack.
Typically, Claymore Charged Attacks cost 40 Stamina per second and can last up to 5 seconds.
Plunging Attacks
Claymore Plunging Attacks are considered Blunt Attacks. All Claymore users have similar animations when plunging, which involves them performing a slash downward with their sword.

<title>Corps of Thirty</title>
<text>The Corps of Thirty is the military and peace-keeping force of Sumeru City hired by Sumeru Akademiya. They are not an officially institutionalized military, but rather a permanently hired mercenary brigade of the The Eremites Eremites. Their headquarters are the barracks stationed at the Citadel of Regzar in the center of the city.
Their head and military commander is the Parchamdar, currently held by Rukh Shah. Additionally, the Corps has a secondary administrative leader titled Consultant, currently Asfand.
Overview
The Corps of Thirty derives its name from the fact that they were originally a band of thirty members hired by the sages of the Akademiya. They are the oldest of the Eremite brigades, and are responsible for managing and coordinating the affairs of all the other mercenary brigades.The Trail of the God of Wisdom Although the group has expanded and nowadays consists of more than 30 members, the name remains unchanged in memory of the founders.Gourmet Supremos: Within Our Duties
Due to their background, the Corps of Thirty's weaponry and uniforms are near identical to those employed by other Eremites, with the exception of their teal-green scarves instead of the usual crimson-red ones. These scarves are also marked by a different petal-like emblem similar to that of the Akademiya, instead of the Eremite's crossed sword triangle. However, the Eremite crest and colors are still used on their banners near their barracks.
The Corps of Thirty has a somewhat tenuous relationship with the other Eremites, and Rukh Shah warns the Traveler about other Eremites they may encounter elsewhere. Alhaitham notes their poor relationship with the Ayn Al-Ahmar, devout followers of King Deshret who loudly denounce Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.

<title>Klingsor</title>
<text>Klingsor is a member of the Abyss Order and one of the main antagonists of the Khvarena of Good and Evil. Sometime before the series begins, he convinced Nasejuna that the Order of Skeptics' origin story was a lie, which led Nasejuna to collaborate with him in their attempt to seize the five Great Song of Khvarena Great Songs of Khvarena.
Several hundred years ago, Klingsor was a member of the Order of Skeptics himself. He became enthralled by the power of the Abyss and transformed into an Abyss Herald, but failed in his initial attempt to bring the power of the Abyss to Teyvat thanks to Zurvan's efforts.
Profile
Klingsor was a member of the Order of Skeptics who descended from Hadura, a Khaenri'ahn and a member of the Schwanenritter. Resentful of Khaenri'ahns' poor reputation following the cataclysm, he began harboring doubts about the Order of Skeptics' teachings, particularly in regards to their origins.Interactables: Records of Unknown Attribution Records of Unknown Attribution (I) Records of Unknown Attribution (I)
He had an opportunity to investigate his doubts when a group of Sumeru Akademiya scholars came to research such ruins despite the Skeptics' attempts to dissuade them; the then-Vijnanapati ordered Klingsor to monitor them and prevent them from going too far in their research, only for Klingsor to find material which he believed confirmed his suspicions. Embracing the power of the Abyss, he became an Abyss Herald and turned his back on the Skeptics, endeavoring to bring "truth" to Teyvat.
Appearance
Klingsor once had the form of a human, but presently appears as an Abyss Herald: Wicked Torrents.
Story
History
Hundreds of years ago, Klingsor was a ranger in the Order of Skeptics. He was a descendant of Hadura, a member of the Schwanenritter during the cataclysm,Interactable: Ruin Golem (Devantaka Mountain) Hadura's Mysterious Chronicle (Hadura's) and appears to have held his Khaenri'ahn lineage in great esteem. Because Khaenri'ahns had a poor reputation due to their involvement in the cataclysm, even though some fought against the Abyss themselves, Klingsor came to suspect that the Order of Skeptics' founder Nagarjuna had hidden something.
When an investigation team from Sumeru Akademiya came to the Girdle of the Sands to investigate Khaenri'ahn ruins, the Vijnanapati at the time dispatched Klingsor to supervise them. While Klingsor originally stuck to his assigned duty, the scholars noticed his interest in the historical records and convinced him to relax his guard.Interactable: Akademiya Investigation Team's Logs Akademiya Investigation Team's Logs (II) Akademiya Investigation Team's Logs (II) At some point, Klingsor stumbled upon Rene's Investigation Notes and kept it. As they made their way into the ruins, some team members heard a "kind of sound coming from under the ground" and wished to turn back, though the team leader chose to press on;Interactable: Akademiya Investigation Team's Logs Akademiya Investigation Team's Logs (III) Akademiya Investigation Team's Logs (III) meanwhile, Klingsor began hearing a "gospel" buzzing in his ears. He eventually came upon the power of the Abyss and was enthralled by it, after which he "embraced the defilement's blessings" and became an Abyss Herald.Interactables: Records of Unknown Attribution Records of Unknown Attribution (II) Records of Unknown Attribution (II) Meanwhile, the investigation team had lost many members to the defense mechanisms inside a previous set of ruins when they were set upon by Abyssal monsters, after which the remaining members "vanish[ed]" and were most likely killed. Klingsor disappeared when the monsters began appearing, causing the author of the Akademiya Investigation Team's Logs to suspect he may have betrayed them.Interactable: Akademiya Investigation Team's Logs Akademiya Investigation Team's Logs (IV) Akademiya Investigation Team's Logs (IV)
By the time Klingsor reappeared in the Girdle of the Sands, he had already become an Abyss Herald while the investigation team was "nowhere to be found." He led the Abyss Order and Abyssal monsters in attacking the Vourukasha Oasis to obtain the Great Songs of Khvarena,The Hymn of Tir Yazad (Part 1) which they would use to reverse the Rite of Chinvat and break the seal over the Abyss at the Tunigi Hollow.As the Khvarena's Light Shows However, the Pari and the Skeptics repelled them, and Zorush sealed the Oasis and many ruins using the Great Songs. However, the Skeptics' archives were destroyed during the conflict, leading them to lose much knowledge of their history.
Present
Klingsor, who still sought to bring the power of the Abyss to Teyvat, kept his eyes on the Skeptics. He found an opportunity with the current Vijnanapati, Nasejuna, who harbored doubts regarding the Skeptics' origins, and showed Nasejuna the documents he had previously found; this proved enough to convince Nasejuna to side with the Abyss Order. To complete the task which Klingsor had failed to do hundreds of years ago, Klingsor and Nasejuna conspired to obtain the Great Songs by tricking the Pari Sorush into gathering them, convincing her that she needed to sacrifice herself to quell the Sign of Apaosh that had appeared over the Harvisptokhm.
At the start of Khvarena of Good and Evil, the Traveler and Paimon accept a commission from the Adventurers' Guild regarding the Sign of Apaosha after discovering the Cryo Korybantes and end up becoming acquainted with Sorush. They obtain the Great Songs with Nasejuna's help, but harbor suspicions about his true intent. Their doubts prove to be right when Nasejuna attempts to seize the songs by force, calling upon Klingsor's aid. The Traveler defeats them, however, and Nasejuna makes a tactical retreat while Klingsor's fate is left unspecified.</text>

<title>Bow</title>
<text>Bows are one of the five weapon types that characters can use in 'Genshin Impact'.
Normal Attacks
A Bow user's Normal Attack chain consists of 4-6 quick mid-range attacks. The trajectory of Bow Normal Attacks will be fixed once fired, and can miss if the target moves out of its path.
Charged Attacks
By holding down the Normal Attack button or clicking the Aiming Mode button, bow users will enter Aiming Mode, in which players can control where the characters aim. Aimed Shots fired in this mode have greater range and increased damage, and will be considered Charged Attack DMG regardless of how long they have been charged.
While in Aiming Mode, the arrow will accumulate an elemental infusion and become fully charged in ~2 seconds (or 1 second for Ganyu). A Fully-Charged Aimed Shot will deal Elemental DMG.
Hitting the enemy's weak spot with an Aimed Shot automatically guarantees a CRIT Hit, and will deal greater Interruption Resistance poise damage and knockback. A sound will play upon landing one.
* On Ruin Machines, this is on the exposed cores.
* On most Mystical Beasts and most humanoid enemies (Kairagi, Nobushi, Treasure Hoarders, Fatui (Enemies) Fatui, etc.), this is directly on the head.
* On certain enemies, the weak point may be protected until the enemy performs certain actions.
Charged shots 'do not' fire straight forward from the bow; rather, the game draws a line between the bow and the terrain the character is aiming at. The arrow is fired along this plane, but the bow is not aligned with it; thus, when firing at close distances, it can be observed that the arrow does not fly straight.
* Enemies and constructs/objects do not count as terrain. For example, if you were to aim at an enemy, but there was a wall 30m behind them, the arrow would be fired along a line drawn to the wall, not to the enemy.
Damage Dropoff
Aimed Shots fired using a bow feature a damage dropoff based on how long an arrow has traveled in the air.
Arrows will travel for 0.7s without experiencing dropoff. After 0.7s:
* For every 0.05s that the arrow travels:
** Its DMG will reduce by 10%, up to 90%.
** Its Gauge Units applied will reduce by 10%, up to 90%.
* For every 0.1s that the arrow travels:
** Its Interruption Resistance Stagger Stagger Level Stagger Level will reduce by one level, down to Mute.
Note that damage dropoff exclusively affects Aimed Shots, and does not affect Normal Attacks.
Charge Levels
Charge Level
Some bow characters have different Aimed Shot Charge Levels.
Arrow Infusion
Fully-Charged arrows can create Elemental Reactions when interacting with the environment. These reactions will consume the elemental aura on the arrow. When fully consumed, these arrows will deal Physical DMG on hit despite being fully charged. For example, it has been observed that:
* Anemo arrows can Swirl in the rain.
* Pyro arrows can Vaporize in the rain.
* Hydro arrows can be Frozen mid-air by Cryo attacks.
Plunging Attacks
All Bow users have similar animations when plunging, which involves them striking downward foot-first and unleashing a shower of arrows around them upon striking the ground.
Bow Plunging Attacks are considered non-Blunt Attack Blunt melee attacks. Therefore, they are able to deal a limited amount of damage to Geo objects such as Minerals.

<title>Tanit</title>
<text>The Tanit were a nomadic Eremite tribe that lived in Sumeru's desert. Their most recent settlement, the Tanit Camps, is located in the southern border of the Desert of Hadramaveth.
Description
The Tanit tribe is a matrilineal clan that believes in the Goddess of Flowers and is led by a Matriarch and Nine Elders. The tribe is the oldest among the tribes that wander the Desert of Hadramaveth, and as a large-scale tribe they have many branches. Unlike the other tribes, the Tanit value the power of words and knowledge, but do not trust the Akasha. One of their main sources of income comes from trading; their crocodile products, spices, and essential oils are extremely popular in Sumeru's markets, and they also hunt Wenut for spices as well.
The Tanit also take part in the plunder known as "hunting." Some of the tribes in the Desert of Hadramaveth will adopt or plunder young children and raise them into Falcons, such as Tadhla, who are devoted to the elders. Only a handful of them will become favored by the Tribe Elders.
The Tanit have no unified law nor written rules, but rather only follow what has been written in their blood and habits. To them, the enemies they hate most are not outsiders, but traitors from within.Sumeru Tanit Tribe
History
The Tanit have lived in Sumeru's desert for an unknown amount of time. In the past, "ascetics" established the Tanit's practice of raising "Falcons", a perversion of the ceremonies conducted by the priests of King Deshret who passed down his art of archery.page=Scion of the Blazing Sun source=Description And among those "ascetics" who disappeared into the desert, some strayed from the path of the priest. ... Using the strict ceremonies of the ancient past, they trained lost children as "Falcons." At some point near the current events of the game, Babel conspired with the Fatui to eliminate the other tribe elders to consolidate power for herself.
After the Traveler and Jeht discovered The Orchard of Pairidaeza, Babel decided to eliminate the Traveler to gain full control of the Eternal Oasis and rebuild the glory days of the desert empire prior to its destruction, ordering the Tanit to eliminate them. However, the Traveler deduced the truth and informed Jeht of the betrayal, who was significantly enraged upon learning the truth. With the Traveler, she destroyed the Tanit, leaving only a few survivors - those that Babel had sent to warn the other tribes of Jeht's "treachery" and those that were in exile and not silenced.
Following the tribe's destruction, the Vahumana Dastur Tanjiyy attempted to make contact with the Tanit to provide educational assistance per the deal that Setaria had made. However, when he arrived, he found the Tanit camps empty and inferred that the tribe was annihilated, although he was unaware of the details.

<title>I. Ivanovna N.</title>
<text>I. Ivanovna N. was a member of the Hexenzirkel, where she went by the codename "J."
After marrying, I. Ivanovna left the Hexenzirkel, although she kept in touch with them from time to time. She passed away centuries ago but had a line of successors, the most recent of which is Scarlett.Joy Above the Clouds
Profile
Little is known about I. Ivanovna's abilities or actions while she was alive. However, it is likely that like the other members of the Hexenzirkel, she was a rather powerful mage. She had a lineage of successors and followers, although none of them were acknowledged by Hexenzirkel Elder Alice until Scarlett.
In 'The Mages' Tea Party' cutscene, I. Ivanovna is represented at the tea party with a pink teacup, with rose and thorn motifs in the background.YouTube:
Appearance
I. Ivanovna is depicted as a light-haired woman wearing a red dress. Later in 'The Mages' Tea Party' cutscene, she is also represented by a woman with wavy, floor-length hair and a large witch's hat.
Story
At some point in her life, I. Ivanovna fell in love with a man and decided to leave the Hexenzirkel after marrying. The day before she was going to be married, Alice, Barbeloth, Andersdotter, Nicole, and Rhinedottir sent her a letter containing a "prophecy," which was actually a request for her to see them again. It can be assumed that she communicated with them using a Lantern of Utmost Joy; after her husband's passing, she told them that she had ended his life to ease him of his suffering.
Although I. Ivanovna passed away centuries ago, she passed her title onto her students and followers. Her most recent successor, Scarlett, had the prophecy which the Hexenzirkel members had written and sought to uncover information about it, leading to the events of Windblume Festival.</text>

<title>Spiral Abyss</title>
<text>the Special Domain the location and organization in the story The Abyss
A massive underground city constructed by an ancient civilization long gone. To this day, the purpose of this underground city remains unknown. Its structure is divided into the "Abyss Corridor," which connects worlds, and the "Abyssal Moon Spire," which leads to the unknown. It is now collectively called the "Spiral Abyss"... It is said that many secrets and treasures that have been long forgotten by this world lay buried within...Monsters and humans alike flock to the tower in search of the secrets and treasures it contains. Challenge different floors of the tower and defeat the enemies within to win Abyssal Stars. Do this, and the Spiral Abyss may yet look upon your hard work and bestow rewards upon you.
The Spiral Abyss is a special type of Domain unlocked at Adventure Rank 20 located in Musk Reef, which can be accessed through the wormhole in the sky at the edge of Cape Oath.
The Spiral Abyss consists of two main parts: the Abyss Corridor (Floors 1–8) and the Abyssal Moon Spire (Floors 9–12). The Corridor's rewards can only be collected once, and completing all floors unlocks the Spire. The Spire's rewards reset on the 1st and 16th days of the month during the Moment of Syzygy. The period beginning on the 1st of every month is called the Waxing Phase while the period beginning on the 16th of every month is called the Waning Phase.
Players can view their current progress on their map, next to their resin count. If no Spiral Abyss challenge exists, it will say "This round's challenge has not yet begun."
Description
Rumor has it that people who've ascended to Celestia have also witnessed the same helix-shaped divine ladder that can be seen within Visions. Venturing out into the universe and down into the abyss are the same in that both are braving the dark unknown. Adventurer Handbook
The cycles of the moon elucidate the turning points of fate, and as the gears turn at the beginning and middle of the month, the treasures hidden at the end of the spire shows itself.Complete Floor 8 Chamber 3 of the Abyss Corridor and challenge the Abyssal Moon Spire to win the treasure of the depths. Moment of Syzygy
A grand underground corridor which leads to an unknown spiral constructed by a great empire that has long gone.What treasures await deep in the palace, and what monsters lurk in the shadow...Surrounded by mysteries, the inverse tower is now known as- Spiral Abyss First Entry Text
Abyssal Stars, Chambers, and Floors
The Spiral Abyss is divided into 12 floors, with each floor containing 3 chambers. In the Abyss Corridor, all enemies across each floor share the same level. In the Abyssal Moon Spire, the enemies in each chamber gradually increase in level.
For Floors 1 to 4, each chamber must be cleared in 300 seconds. From Floor 5 onwards, each chamber must be cleared in 600 seconds - in floors where the Ley Line Monolith must be protected, it must be kept intact, or the player will fail. In floors where 2 teams are required, the second half of the chamber starts with the time remaining from the first half.
All chambers have challenges that can be completed in order to obtain additional rewards outside of first-time clears. Currently, there are only two types of challenges - one in which the player needs to clear the chamber in a set amount of time, and another in which a Ley Line Monolith must have a specific amount of health. Entering the next floor requires you to have earned at least six Abyssal Stars from the previous floor, as well as having cleared all three of the previous floor's chambers.
Total stars earned are retroactive. In other words, it is not necessary to clear the entire floor to get more stars. If the player had obtained 3 stars from the second and final chambers of a floor, but none from the first on their first try, they may try the first chamber as much as they would like, with any stars gained during these attempts being saved even after leaving and restarting the floor.
The Abyss Corridor has various time requirements that are generally inconsistent across floors. However, the Ley Line Monolith defense is the same across both the Corridor and Moon Spire.
In the Abyssal Moon Spire, the time requirements are more consistent, with the first two chambers of floors 9, 10 and 11 requiring a clear time of 60/180/300 seconds for their stars. In the third chamber of floors 9, 10 and 11, and all of floor 12, the clear time required for their stars is reduced to 180/300/420 seconds.
Abyss Corridor and the Abyssal Moon Spire
The Spiral Abyss is composed of two parts: The "Abyss Corridor" and the "Abyssal Moon Spire." Clear all 8 floors of the Abyss Corridor to permanently unlock the Abyssal Moon Spire.
Seemingly following the lunar cycle of another world, the Abyssal Moon Spire will reset itself twice a month, occurring on the first and sixteenth days of the month, which may also cause a new period of Blessing of the Abyssal Moon to begin. However, the generous treasures found in the Abyss Corridor which connects the world to the Abyssal Spire will not change or reset over time. It should also be noted the moon visible in the abyssal moon spire is clearly distinct from the moon over Teyvat.
While the enemies in the Abyssal Moon Spire change, those in the Abyss Corridor are always the same across all updates.
Combat Bonuses and Restrictions
Restrictions and Ley Line Disorders
There are several restrictions in the Spiral Abyss. When challenging each floor, the player cannot:
*Consume food or other consumables
*Change party members
*Change artifacts or weapons
*Level up or ascend characters
In addition, each floor in the Spiral Abyss has different Ley Line Disorders, which could give buffs or debuffs to characters, enemies, or both. In order to complete the challenge more easily, consider the enemies in each chamber and the Ley Line Disorder in effect.
Divergence
Starting at Floor 5, the Spiral Abyss will diverge into two paths. To dive deeper, the player must arrange two teams of up to four characters to challenge each half a chamber. The player cannot use the same character in both teams.
Enemy HP
On certain floors of the Spiral Abyss, enemies have increased HP values compared to those of their counterparts encountered in the open world:
* Increased by 50%: Floors 3 - 7
* Increased by 100%: Floors 8 - 11
* Increased by 150%: Floor 12
Benediction of the Abyss
Spiral Abyss/Benediction of the Abyss l1=Benediction of the Abyss
The everlasting whisper of the Spiral Abyss encourages you to go deeper. Choose your Benediction of the Abyss...
Challengers will receive recognition from the depths of the Spiral Abyss. This recognition comes in the form of a buff that assists the player in battle.
At the start of each chamber, the player can choose to receive one Benediction of the Abyss. Different benedictions have different effects and durations:
* Effective this floor: Effect lasts until entering the next floor.
* Effective this chamber: Effect lasts until entering the next chamber.
* Effective immediately: Effect starts immediately.
Choosing the right Benediction according to the party composition will help complete the challenge more easily.
The Benedictions list for each Chamber is updated every Daily Reset.

<title>Fontaine Research Institute</title>
<text>the faction the subarea New Fontaine Research Institute the area Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering Region
The Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering, often shortened to Fontaine Research Institute, is an organization in Fontaine.Vibro-Crystal Reharmonization
Profile
The Fontaine Research Institute is a research center dedicated to studying machines and energy. Many of its inventions benefit Fontaine, such as the clockwork mechanisms and kinetic cores created by their founder Alain Guillotin. Most mechanical inventions come from the Fontaine Research Institute. Unlike the Sumeru Akademiya, it does not exercise any administrative responsibility over the people of Fontaine or aim to educate.
According to Augustus Lovelace, it used to be a paradise for researchers until Raimondo and Choiseul Mr. Choiseul took over, where afterwards the spirit of research at the institute has been in freefall.
One of the primary purposes of the research institute was to search for solutions to the prophesied flood that will dissolve the people of Fontaine and the researchers believed harnessing the energy of Arkhium to defy gravity was considered the key. Edwin Eastinghouse, a Senior Technician, created the Prototype Cal. Breguet series of Clockwork Meka to alleviate the water situation. While conducting his research, the field generator's Arkhium core overloaded, resulting in a massive explosion that leveled most of the institute, sending several giant blocks of Allogravity-Condensed Water Bodies and remnants of the old ruins in the sky.
As a result of the disaster, the institute was forced to recollect and built a New Fontaine Research Institute new location near the old ruins while maintaining what was not destroyed in the explosion. The Callas Line was also shut down.Court of Fontaine: Court Region Waterway Hub Aquabus Station Notice
According to Salsa, the Central Laboratory ruins in the sky have been rebuilt and the Institute is "considering launching a "Ruins Tour" for outsiders". She also says that the currently used building is not as pretty as the ruins and that the Institute has "financial problems".Good Stuff, but Terrible Taste (Belleau Region)
The Institute is fairly controversial in their own nation, as their lack of responsibility has often resulted in a lack of accountability and infamy; Elphane claims that an Institute Technician can drone on for a day without any relevant information or perspective, which she finds "ghastly". The Mekafish were also developed by the Institute to help clean Fontaine's waters, but they began killing fish as part of their cleaning tasks, resulting in Linorea holding a grudge against them for believing their nonsense.
During the events of Fontaine Research Institute Chronicles, the Traveler helps the institute. In the process, Nacker, a researcher who worked with Edwin, created a smaller explosion which Raimondo believed him to be attempting to sell and the Arkhium core for a fortune. Nacker's tampering also reactivated the prototype generator, which the Traveler managed to shut down and replaced them with inhibitors to help stabilize the Arkhium traces in the ruins, stopping it from exploding at any point for the time being. They would eventually track Nacker down, who had acquired another benefactor named Concini. During their investigation, they also discovered that Edwin was also alive, both men trying to continue their research into Arkhium. Nacker's plans were eventually foiled and both men were brought back to the Institute, where they were subsequently fired and sent to the Fortress of Meropide.</text>

<title>Qiqi/Lore</title>
<text>An apprentice and herb gatherer at Bubu Pharmacy. "Blessed" by the adepti with a body that cannot die, this petite zombie cannot do anything without first giving herself orders to do it.Qiqi's memory is like a sieve. Out of necessity, she always carries around a notebook in which she writes anything important that she is sure to forget later.But on her worst days, she even forgets to look at her notebook...
Personality
An apprentice and herb gatherer at Bubu Pharmacy. An undead with a bone-white complexion, she seldom has much in the way of words or emotion.
Qiqi has a quiet yet polite demeanor when dealing with customers at the pharmacy. As a zombie, Qiqi has trouble retaining memories and can quickly forget about people if she doesn't continually reinforce herself with an impression of them, using her Vision to protect those she holds dear. Due to her undead nature, Qiqi has a relatively dull tone of voice and cannot convey most of her emotions to others, nor does she have a sense of smell. Despite her stoicness, she retains a sense of childlike naivety, as she believed coconut milk to have come from an animal, even dubbing said fictional creature the "cocogoat". She prefers cold weather, as the heat reminds her of death, and her flesh begins to decay if she stays too long in such places.
Although zombies have to be issued orders when awoken, because Qiqi had done so herself, she is a rare case. She has to give herself orders to perform her duties. These duties cannot be canceled, and she must either finish the task or be forced to cancel it by hugging her with enough sincerity. She takes her responsibilities seriously, carrying a notebook in which she details everything she needs to do for the day, which also serves as a reminder in case she forgets something. She also strives to improve herself, so she becomes less forgetful. However, some days, she may forget to check on her notebook.
While she generally gets along with everyone, she loses it whenever Hu Tao comes or is mentioned, remarking that she has a "punchable face" and despises her, expressing an intent to throw the director into the fridge due to her insistence on sealing her away. This has happened so often that Qiqi began to remember and fear Hu Tao, even memorizing hiding places to avoid her. Even after giving her an exception and pampering her, Qiqi still holds a grudge against Hu Tao. Although Qiqi works for Baizhu, she can never remember his face, which she does not mind since she is aware that he has ulterior motives toward her.
Appearance
Summerchill Dreams
Qiqi uses the Short Female Characters short female model. She has pale skin, magenta-colored eyes, and light purple hair that is chin-length except for a section at the back of her head that goes down past her hips.
Despite being a zombie, Qiqi claims to be in better shape than her boss, Baizhu. She performs calisthenics daily to prevent rigor mortis from setting in, which would otherwise force her to continually hop around to move.
Official Introduction
Qiqi:Fortune Preserver Amidst Everlasting Cold
Gather herbs in the morning. Make medicine in the afternoon. Do light stretches in the evening.
An apprentice and herb gatherer at Bubu Pharmacy, Qiqi is an undead with a bone-white complexion.
She seldom has much in the way of words or emotions.
"Blessed" by the adepti with a body that cannot die, this petite zombie retains her original appearance as a child. Who knows how old she really is...
Zombies must have orders before they can do anything. Somehow Qiqi ended up responsible for giving orders to herself.
Qiqi's memory is like a sieve. Out of necessity, she always carries around a notebook.
Despite how problematic her memory may be, she is actually quite well-equipped to get through the day: she can use orders to force herself to complete tasks; if she forgets anything, she can look at her notebook for a reminder; and if any task proves difficult, her incredible strength can help solve many problems.
Recently, she has also added a section on "brain training" and "mnemonic methods." Her notebook is becoming a true "dummy's guide" on just about anything.
But on her worst days, she even forgets to look at her notebook...
If while in the mountains of Liyue you see someone bumping into things, walking in circles, or chasing squirrels that don't exist, it is almost certainly to be the adorable undead herb gatherer. If she seems to be struggling, please lend a helping hand!
"I am Qiqi. I am a zombie. And I forgot what comes next."
An apprentice and herb gatherer at Bubu Pharmacy.
"Blessed" by the adepti with a body that cannot die, this petite zombie cannot do anything without first giving herself orders to do it.
Qiqi's memory is like a sieve. Out of necessity, she always carries around a notebook in which she writes anything important that she is sure to forget later.
But on her worst days, she even forgets to look at her notebook...
Character Stories
Due to being a zombie, Qiqi lacks facial expression. She hopes that's okay.She may look like a zombie, but she's surprisingly limber due to a strict calisthenics regimen.Her memory is poor. She forgets easily, and that is partly why she can seem cold to others.Her appearance is forever frozen at the point of her passing, so estimates of her age are unreliable.Zombies require orders to act, but due to some reason or another, Qiqi is presently giving herself orders.
Usually, zombies are cold and stiff, which forces them to locomote by hopping about.As such, Qiqi keeps up a calisthenics regimen to retain a human-like form.The 77th-generation Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, Hu Tao, doesn't see the point of all this. Whenever she meets Qiqi, she will say: "It would be easier if you just let me bury you."Qiqi, of course, has no wish to be buried, and so conducts her exercises at night when no one's about.Qiqi's memory falls far behind those of non-undead disposition.If she does not continue to reinforce her impressions of someone, she will completely forget them in three days tops.But who knows, this might be a good thing - for a person with painful memories, forgetting may, in fact, be a form of release.The person Qiqi must remember most... not only does this person have a very punch-able face, but she also shows up every single day.As such, Qiqi isn't too concerned about her poor memory.
Qiqi is very petite indeed, but is in fact a very powerful zombie. Her short stature is hardly any impediment, but is instead good for high-speed movement.In combat, Qiqi will unleash the self-control that she usually maintains, allowing her body to return to an undead state, increasing her strength and speed."You're dead."Once she has stoically defeated her enemies, Qiqi will once again get her muscles under control, returning to her normal state.She has been threatened in the past by Treasure Hoarders while picking herbs by herself.Now, a little girl, all by herself, seems like an easy target, no?Who would have thought that this girl could send a whole crew flying?This is why we should always remember never to judge a person based on appearances. Or a zombie, for that matter.
Zombies mostly require orders from the person who awakens them to move. But strictly speaking, Qiqi has never been awakened.As such, she counts as a very rare case of a zombie that gives itself orders.If these orders are simple ones like "defeat the enemy," Qiqi has no problem fulfilling them.But when faced with complex instructions such as "go to Jueyun Karst, climb the sheer rock faces and pick herbs," Qiqi sometimes winds up stuck below the cliffs, unable to give up no matter how many times she tries and fails to scale the cliff.The method to cancel her orders is very simple - hug Qiqi from behind, tell her something like "I love you the most," and the orders will dissipate, just like that.Unfortunately, there's just no element of sincerity when Baizhu does it, leading to greatly reduced results.Perhaps someday, someone will come along who understands that such words cannot be spoken lightly, and who slowly but carefully releases the hold that Qiqi's orders have over her...What will Qiqi's response be then?
This ancient story has long been forgotten by mortals.An ordinary herb-picking lass named Qiqi lost her way and trespassed the realm of the adepti. Injuring her right leg in a fall, she hurriedly hid in a cavern to rest.Even occupied as she was in bandaging her wound, she could hear sounds that did not belong to the mortal plane. But she could have never expected that with a huge crash, she would forever be trapped between life and death.Whether adepti or demons, just or wicked, all understood that she was an innocent mortal caught in the crossfire.Or perhaps it was by the will of heaven that she received a Vision in her dying moments, and so ended this contention between adepti and demon.The adepti could not bear to let her die, and each imparted to her a portion of their strength, meaning to breathe life back into her body.Qiqi did indeed awaken and live again, but went into a berserk state, unable to control the adepti energy raging through her.Seeking to end the disturbance, Mountain Shaper had no choice but to seal the hapless maiden in amber.
After hundreds of years, Qiqi was discovered by humans, still trapped in the amber, and was brought to Wangsheng Funeral Parlor for burial.The mountain roads were treacherous, however, and the amber was bumped about. Coupled with the passing of many years, the seal on Qiqi was all but spent.She awakened in the middle of the night, broke the amber in secret, and fled.Following the herb-picking habits of her previous life, Qiqi headed right for the hills.By chance, she met Baizhu, the boss of Bubu Pharmacy, on the way, and he took her in.Now, Baizhu was a doctor of great skill, but he was hardly a man of high caliber or great courage.Even so, he took her in, never mind that her memory was so poor that she could not even sort herbs out.It does seem that his acceptance of Qiqi has something to do with his own personal pursuits.Qiqi is stiff, but not slow, and has long realized this. However, she does not take it to heart.Perhaps she has seen too much, or been alone for too long... But what remains true is that she treasures his concern, even if there is some other motive behind it.
Qiqi carries something with her that looks like a notebook.Qiqi's memory is very poor, so it is an object of irreplaceable importance if she is to smoothly go about her daily life.The words within are written in a centuries-old style, and are very elegant indeed.The first page is an instructional on calisthenics.Moving past that, one finds the descriptions of various herbs and some "orders."Qiqi needs to give herself orders, so she has very precise instructions to ensure smooth transition.She has also dutifully written down all the things she needs to do in a day.Recently, she has also added a section on "brain training" and "mnemonic methods."At this point, it has become a true "dummy's guide" on just about anything.But if the day ever comes when Qiqi also forgets to look at her notebook... there would truly be nothing for it then.
Qiqi's Vision was given to her in the last moment of her life.She wanted to stop the clock from turning. She wanted to live happily again.She feared death. She wanted to live. She missed her family... These feelings coalesced at last into "ice.""If only I could freeze time... How wonderful would that be?"As she thought thus, tears fell from the moribund girl's eyes upon the Vision that had appeared before her.The mighty and illuminated adepti all acknowledged this as a legitimate form of "illumination" - the yearning of humanity for bygone days is, after all, a desire to protect that past.

<title>Iwakura Clan</title>
<text>The Iwakura Clan is a large Martial Arts in Teyvat martial arts (and potentially familial) clan in Inazuma founded by Iwakura Michihiro five hundred years ago, after he developed his unique sword technique known as the Tengu Sweeper.Emblem of Severed Fate
The martial arts techniques passed down by the Iwakura Clan and those affiliated with the clan is known as the Iwakura Art ja=岩蔵流. It is unclear whether there is a distinction between the Iwakura Clan and the Iwakura Art.
Overview
The Iwakura Clan is a group of martial artists that specialized in swordsmanship. Founded by Iwakura Michihiro, the clan was particularly well known and is memorialized in an Inazuman folk song as "Iwakura the Successor."Mistsplitter Reforged Many of the members use the title "Iwakura Art" to show their affiliation to the clan dojo.
Like with other martial arts schools in Inazuma, there are several different proficiency levels in the Iwakura Art. The following are known proficiency levels:
# Soushu ja=宗主 ja_tl=Clan Head: The highest rank within the Iwakura Art. Those at this rank who have also learned the clan's secret techniques affix their given name with "In" or "Tane" ja=胤 ja_tl=lineage, descendant;Iwakura Mitsunari
# Menkyo Kaiden ja=免許皆伝 ja_tl=Full Mastership: A high-level rank within the Iwakura Art.
# Okuden ja=奥伝 ja_tl=Esoteric, Hidden: A mid-level rank within the Iwakura Art. Those at this rank can become Acting Instructors ja=師範代 ja_tl=assistant instructor.
# Shoden ja=初伝 ja_tl=Elementary, Basic: A low rank within the Iwakura Art.
History
The clan was founded by Iwakura Michihiro after redemption by Teruyo of the Yougou Tengu. He eventually developed a technique known as the "Tengu Sweeper," fast and powerful enough to catch even a Tengu. His techniques were noted by an unknown person(s) while he was still alive and they developed the Maguu Kenki series to imitate him, but they malfunctioned, went out of control, and were discarded. Two such puppets found their way onto Yashiori Island, while another was stolen by members of Ako Domeki's pirate crew and wound up in the Golden Apple Archipelago after they were separated from the rest.
In recent history, Eiin was the previous Soushu of the Iwakura Clan. He was its Master when Okazaki Toraemon and Okazaki Kunihiko were adopted, by which point Iwakura Mitsunari, Shimada Shichirouji, and Yanagiha Arashi were also members of the clan. Eiin was succeeded by Mitsunari, who learned the clan's secret techniques and took up the name "Iwakura Kouin," as well as the heirloom sword.Iwakura Mitsunari
Since the war between the Watatsumi Army and the Shogunate broke out with the announcement of the Vision Hunt Decree, the Iwakura Clan has been scattered across Inazuma. Mitsunari had his Vision confiscated as part of the decree and chose to serve the Shogunate, seeing his decision as the "path of righteousness". Arashi and Toraemon were expelled from the clan, presumably for disagreeing with his decision. The rest of the clan's members, likewise, defected and went into hiding.
During the Traveler's journey across Narukami Island Narukami, Kannazuka and Yashiori Island, they encountered five Iwakura Clan practitioners. For various reasons of their own, these Iwakura Clan members attempt to kill them and are killed in self-defense. After slaying several Iwakura Clan members, speaking to Mitsunari at the Kujou Encampment has the Traveler reveal that they defeated them all. Seeing this as an offense towards the clan's reputation, and to avenge his fallen juniors, Mitsunari duels the Traveler, but is defeated and dies.
Arashi and Toraemon, who had been traveling across Inazuma, eventually learned of the Traveler killing Iwakura Art practitioners. They collected their fallen brethren's swords, apart from Mitsunari's, for a memorial in Byakko Plain at the same place where Kunihiko was killed. As they finished setting up the memorial, the Traveler encountered the two. After allowing the Traveler to listen into their conversation for a bit, the two rope the Traveler into a battle to avenge their fallen members, only to meet the same fate themselves. The Traveler then collects their swords and places them on the monument soon after.
With all its known practitioners dead and left without any known heirs, the Iwakura Clan has presumably died out. The Maguu Kenki, whose combat abilities were designed based on Doukei's techniques,Maguu Kenki are now the only remaining "practitioners" of the Iwakura Art.

<title>Rhinedottir</title>
<text>Rhinedottir, also known as "Gold," is a researcher from Khaenri'ah and practitioner of the Art of Khemia. She is best known for her masterpieces, Durin and Albedo. As "Gold," she is also called the "Great Sinner."
She is linked to the cataclysm 500 years ago, which led to the fall of Khaenri'ah's Eclipse Dynasty and spawned monsters in the world of Teyvat.Breeze Amidst the ForestChunk of Aerosiderite
She is also a member of the Hexenzirkel under the code name "R," and described by the organisation as "'A flower that is not of this world'."Joy Above the Clouds
Profile
Unborn life, unfulfilled wishes,Tragic dreams at the edge of the universal darkness that could never come true,Indwell my body, and descend unto this world.
Rhinedottir is a proficient alchemist with mastery over the Art of Khemia, which was developed and practiced in Khaenri'ah. She is longtime friends with the adventurer Alice, though how they came to know each other or how long ago they met, given the longevity of Alice and Klee's race, is currently unknown.
After discovering the Heart of Naberius with Albedo, she disappeared without a trace. However, she left Albedo with a note, a recommendation letter, and a piece of classical text. She tasked Albedo with finding the "truth and meaning of this world" as his final assignment.
Rhinedottir is known to Skirk, though she had only heard the name from her master Surtalogi. Skirk also remarked that like her master, Rhinedottir too is "pursuing some form of perfection". The exact relationship between Rhinedottir and Surtalogi is not known.
Story
Rhinedottir was an alchemist and researcher who attained the pinnacle of both knowledge and alchemical prowess, thus coming to be known as "Gold". She was particularly proficient in the Art of Khemia and created all sorts of living beings, which she classified under several categories, including the "Alfisol" (Riftwolves), "Humus" (Durin), and "Cretaceus" (Albedo).
At some point, Rhinedottir created the dragon Durin, which she considered her masterpiece at the time. She also created Primordial Albedo as part of her Primordial Human Project, intended to create humans through alchemy. However, she deemed him a failure and left him within Durin's stomach.The Shadows Deepen
The Cataclysm
Cataclysm The Cataclysm in Teyvat
Five hundred years before the start of the game, a great disaster ravaged all of Teyvat around the same time that Khaenri'ah fell. Because of conflicting information given, it is currently uncertain whether Rhinedottir's creatures traveled to Teyvat first, thus attracting the attention of the gods in Celestia and The Seven which resulted in Khaenri'ah's destruction, or if Khaenri'ah's destruction at their hands caused Rhinedottir to send her creations to Teyvat.
From the perspective of the people of Teyvat, the fall of Khaenri'ah's Eclipse Dynasty set off a chain of disasters. Among them was the army of "shadowy monsters" created by "Gold," which then invaded Teyvat.Breeze Amidst the Forest A contrasting perspective given by Durin's memories instead claim that Rhinedottir had sent him away from Khaenri'ah to "display [his] beauty,"Festering Desire with any nefarious intentions left ambiguous, while the Riftwolves invaded Teyvat of their own volition.Golden Wolflord It unknown whether she is aware of the havoc her creations caused.
Notably, both Dainsleif and Pierro, who are survivors from Khaenri'ah, have indicated that multiple figures from their nation were responsible for invoking Celestia's wrath. Nevertheless, the role the Art of Khemia played in Khaenri'ah's downfall has put both Dainsleif and Venti on guard against it.YouTube:
After the Cataclysm
Rhinedottir apparently emerged relatively unscathed from the cataclysm. She eventually made a breakthrough in her Primordial Human Project and created the "perfect" Albedo, which she classified as "Cretaceus," and taught him everything she knew as they ventured in and out of domains. One day, they stumbled upon an item known as the Heart of Naberius. Shortly afterwards, Rhinedottir disappeared, leaving Albedo with the task of discovering the "truth and meaning of this world" and directing him to seek out help from Alice in Mondstadt.

<title>Descender</title>
<text>"Descender" is a term used by the Fatui and other notable individuals for outlanders who do not originate from the world of Teyvat but come to live within it. The Traveler is known as the Fourth Descender, and Lesser Lord Kusanali presumes that the Heavenly Principles is the First.A Toast to Victory
Overview
Because Descenders come from outside Teyvat, they are not bound to the world's laws and are unaffected by circumstances that affect beings from this world. Furthermore, information and memories about them are not recorded in Irminsul, which only collects information about Teyvat. Conversely, their memories are not changed when Irminsul is tampered with, when that normally affects not only people's memories, but also non-sentient items such as books, and even in-game descriptions such as Character Stories.
For example, the Traveler remembers Greater Lord Rukkhadevata after all traces of her existence were erased from Irminsul and thus, from history and memory itself.Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies They also remember Scaramouche after he removes his names from Irminsul, while Nahida and Paimon both forget him.The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's CallThe Kabukimono's Finale
Not much is known about the Third Descender, however Skirk revealed to Neuvillette that Gnosis Gnoses are made from the remains of the Third Descender. Neuvillette and the Traveler later speculated that elemental power might be intrinsic to Descenders, given that both the Gnoses and the Vision-less Traveler are imbued with said power. If this is true, it would be expected that other Descenders would be able to wield elemental powers, as well.
Other Definitions
Rene's research with the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, largely derived from ancient Khaenri'ahn, Remurian, and Sumeru sources, led to his conclusion that Descenders have "wills that can rival an entire world," and not all who come from outside of Teyvat are necessarily Descenders.Interactable: The Narzissenkreuz Ordo Notes  1 Notes  1

Possible Descenders
Several historical figures who have come from outside Teyvat have been mentioned via books and in-game descriptions, but have not been definitely confirmed as one of the other three Descenders.
The Primordial One mentioned in 'Before Sun and Moon' matches Apep's description of the Heavenly PrinciplesWhat Shape Does the Self Hold and Neuvillette's description of the "First Usurper."Calamitous Tread Neuvillette: They say that when the First Usurper arrived on Teyvat, they seized a part of the dragons' power. Today, that stolen power is the basis of the Archons' Authorities. This entity came from outside of Teyvat, took power from the Seven Sovereigns, suppressed the old order, and established the world in its current state.The Byakuyakoku Collection An unknown amount of time ago, the Heavenly Principles and "one who came after" used the Third Descender's remains to create the Gnoses.Finale
'Before Sun and Moon' also mentions the Second Who Came, or the "second throne of the heavens," who was the next entity to come from beyond this world. They waged war against the Primordial One, which wreaked massive destruction throughout the world and caused Enkanomiya to sink underwater. However, the book's author surmises the Second Who Came lost, attributing the Enkanomiyans' inability to return to the surface to the Primordial One's power.
Notably, the Traveler's Sibling Traveler's sibling is 'not' considered a Descender, despite coming from the sea of stars with the Traveler. Furthermore, their travels throughout Teyvat following the fall of Khaenri'ah have been recorded in Irminsul, leading Nahida to conclude that they originate from Teyvat despite the discrepancy with the Traveler's memories. The Traveler suspects that either something is wrong with their own memories, or that "this world" has done something to their sibling. Scaramouche also divulges that the Sibling "only came to this world because the heavens responded to the summoning," and that their differences from the Traveler may relate to Khaenri'ah, which is something he learned from Pierro.

<title>Mika/Lore</title>
<text>A young knight who is a key member of the front-line scouting team. Quiet an unassuming, Mika treats every task seriously, and can cookup a mean serving of field rations. However, he can't seem to hide his bashful and shy personality when meeting strangers.
Personality
A young knight born to an ordinary family. He serves as a Front-Line Surveyor in his Company. He is a low-key and cautious character.
Seemingly shy and distant at first, Mika eventually warms up to the people he knows. To those unfamiliar to him, especially those with high rankings, Mika prefers to observe them and understand their personalities before properly interacting with them as a sign of respect.Charity Event! A Great Success! He does seem to rely on other people for decisions, such as when to talk or what to say.Sounds From Afar (Quest)
Despite his young age, Mika is mature and responsible, taking care of his older brother when he comes home drunk and completes his tasks without complaining or having much issue with them. He enjoys cartography, wanting to become Mondstadt's expert cartographer and expressing a desire to map all of Teyvat. While friends with Klee, he often has to remap due to her explosives altering the landscape, though he does not mind.
Appearance
Soaring Beacon
Mika uses the Medium Male Characters medium male model. He has fair skin, blue eyes, and curled golden hair that sticks out in irregular tufts and are golden brown at the tips.
Official Introduction
Mika: With a feather plume as gold as maize, uncharted borders are depicted as clear as day
I recruited Mika into the expedition team to hone his combat skills. As for why he reports directly to me... Well, since Jean isn't with us, I needed someone trustworthy to deal with all the odd errands, hahaha.
Mika, who is a member of the Knights of Favonius Reconnaissance Company, always diligently fulfills all the duties that come his way.
Setting up tents, lighting fires for cooking, repairing equipment... Even Hertha, the logistics captain, has nothing but praise for Mika's excellent efficiency.
Mika's dedication to work is not due to a weak character or his inability to say no, but instead stems from the value that he attaches to teamwork, and a genuine desire to learn from his experienced colleagues.
"Helping everyone as much as possible benefits the entire team too!"
Mika's favorite pastime is closely linked to his primary duty as a front-line surveyor.
That is: surveying unexplored regions, recording topographical data, and drawing accurate and effective maps.
"There is an abundance of resources here, but it is surrounded by monsters. Take note to exercise caution."
Mika, whose dream is to become an expert cartographer, adds another annotation to the new version of the military map he is designing.
Character Stories
Whenever he shows up at the Knights of Favonius headquarters, Mika always swiftly finishes any discussions to be had with his fellow knights, then quietly slips away to avoid becoming a hindrance to others' work.Mika always gets nervous when someone strikes up a conversation with him, frantically scampering away right after politely putting an end to the idle chatter.The knights know that the young man's name is Mika, and that he is Huffman's younger brother and the second son of the Schmidt family. They also know that he is a member of the Reconnaissance Company, but nothing much beyond that.Few are aware of what Mika's job entails, nor do they know that the widely-promoted, updated version of their military map is the fruit of his labors.The new map consists of detailed statistical data regarding almost every corner of Mondstadt with practical markers indicating road conditions, areas with heightened monster activity, high ground that can serve as temporary strongholds, and the distribution of natural resources... The amount of detail could almost make your head spin.All of this is the result of Mika's own labor throughout the two years he has spent traveling all across Mondstadt and investigating every inch of terrain he set foot on.Knights who have fought alongside Mika know that he finds using both lance and crossbow at the same time the most convenient, and his unique fighting style has left a lasting impression.However, they have also been solemnly "warned" by Mika to never speak of him to others unless absolutely necessary."Mika's terrified of drawing the attention of others - he'll get nervous if you so much as stare at him, to say nothing of showering him with compliments. He's been a great asset to the Knights and helped us out a lot, so respecting his boundaries is the least we can do as seniors!"
Mika comes from a loving family. His mother works as an author writing about local conditions, his father is a retired Knight of Favonius, and his older brother Huffman is a current member in the Knights' ranks.When Mika began learning to read, his mother went inspiration-gathering abroad with his father accompanying her. During that time, the responsibility of looking after little Mika landed in Huffman's hands.However, Huffman had already made the Knights of Favonius his second home - he was preoccupied with work during the day and indulged in drinking with his friends night after night. With his own life lacking organization, how was he expected to take care of his little brother?So it was little Mika who learned to take care of both himself and his brother whenever he'd return home drunk at night. When other children his age were enjoying their childhood without a care, Mika had already learned to stick to an organized schedule, sometimes even helping Huffman with his everyday chores.While they were away, Mika's parents always made sure to send a letter back to Mondstadt every week to keep their children from worrying. Mika's mother, being an excellent writer, could somehow describe the scenery she's seen in a mesmerizing way akin to fairytales. Mika loved to read his parents' letters before looking for their exact location and marking out their travel route on a map. Picturing his parents' wonderful adventures was Mika's favorite pastime.Before long, Mika developed a passion for reading maps, and even committed the terrain of many locations to memory.Unfortunately, Huffman had to ruin the mood when he broke the bad news to Mika: "I'm afraid your efforts have been wasted on the map Mom and Dad left us. It's very outdated, and it wasn't very accurately drawn in the first place." But that was to be expected. After all, those who with the ability freely explore the wilderness would likely have all become adventurers with nothing but commissions and Mora on their minds. To them, just about any map would do.On the other hand, most of those who knew how to draw decent maps were not skilled in combat, so it would be much too dangerous for them to survey the wilderness themselves. Not to mention their limited income, which wouldn't allow them to afford bodyguards. Perhaps the time would come when the Knights of Favonius finally had sufficient budget to hire experts to deal with matters like these, but with Mondstadt as peaceful as one could hope for, no one knew for sure when something as trivial as cartography could be put on the schedule. So little Mika thought to himself: If he could reach every corner of the world just like his parents, and record every detail of the terrain beneath his feet... That would be the most fun ever.From then on, Mika set a clear goal for himself."I'll become Mondstadt's expert cartographer."</text>

<title>Kaedehara Clan</title>
<text>The Kaedehara Clan is an Inazuman clan and the one which Kaedehara Kazuha hails from. It was the leader of the Isshin Art, one of the schools within the Raiden Gokaden, before its collapse.
History
The Kaedehara Clan was a noble samurai clan of notable fame in Inazuma and a subordinate branch of the Kamisato Clan.
Over 500 years ago, Kaedehara Kagemitsu received tutelage from the bladesmith Futsu Masayoshi, who had been trained in the techniques of the Futsu School, one of five bladesmithing arts in the Raiden Gokaden. Kagemitsu, himself a member of the Isshin Art, went on to become known as one of the "Isshin Sansaku,"Haran Geppaku Futsu Lore or "Three Great Masters of the Isshin Art."The names Kagemitsu, Nagamitsu, and Sanenaga (Mitsunaga) are direct references to three master swordsmiths of the Osafune School, collectively known as the "Three Great Masters" ja=三作 ja_rm=sansaku. While the characters in 'sansaku' literally translate to "three works," which is how the English localization interpreted its usage in Haran Geppaku Futsu's description, it was historically used to refer to the swordsmiths themselves.
Roughly 100 years ago,Assuming a generation lasts roughly 20 to 40 years and Kazuha is in his late teens to early twenties, a rough approximation for the birth of Kazuha's great-grandparents' generation would be 80 to 140 years ago. Niwa Yoshinori was adopted by the head of the Kaedehara Clan after his father's disappearance, and changed his name to Kaedehara Yoshinori. When swordsmiths of the Isshin Art repeatedly failed to create an important Goshintou blade using the Raiden Shogun's diagram and fled out of fear of punishment, Yoshinori and the head of the Kamisato Clan investigated the matter. Realizing that the diagram had likely been tampered with, they tracked the bladesmiths down to a beach northwest of Byakko Plain. Instead of the swordsmiths, they found Kunikuzushi, the wanderer now known as Scaramouche, lying in wait. Scaramouche easily defeated the entire group, sparing them only after recognizing Yoshinori as a descendant of the Niwa Family and leaving him with a vague message: "Tell her this. My name is Kunikuzushi." Afterwards, the Kamisato head ordered Yoshinori to conceal the truth to avoid being accused of conspiring with the saboteur. Fearful of Scaramouche's claim that he would destroy the Raiden Gokaden, Yoshinori also stopped the family business and refused to pass down the Isshin Art's techniques.The Palace, Dyed in Black (Quest)
Kazuha's grandfather, Kaedehara Hisamichi,As the Courtyard in Spring Once Appeared (Part 1) attempted to revive the Isshin Art, but failed Yoshinori's challenge of crafting the Goshintou using the sabotaged diagram. Failing to pick up on Yoshinori's words about "find[ing] the secret within," Hisamichi grew enraged by Yoshinori's claim that the Isshin Art "deserved" to fade away and departed to other lands in his fruitless attempt to reverse the family's ill fortune. He would not return until after Yoshinori had already passed away, something which he came to regret.
Hisamichi himself took up the art of bonsai growing, basing some scenes on the views he saw during his travels. He told his son, Kaedehara Kageharu, that he hoped his grandson - Kazuha - would not follow in his footsteps and would see more of the world.
By the time Kazuha was born, the clan was on the verge of collapse, having almost no fortunes to inherit when the time came. Eventually, their house was repossessed by the authorities and the last attendant was dismissed. After he was deemed a criminal under the Vision Hunt Decree, the clan's property and possessions was confiscated and held at a warehouse near the Police Station. With his arrest warrant repealed after the abolishment of the Decree, Kazuha has requested Kujou Sara to sell the possessions and donate the proceeds to the poor.

<title>Cyrus (Sumeru)</title>
<text>the Sumeru Akademiya scholar other characters with the same name Cyrus
Cyrus is a retired Sumeru Akademiya professor and a former sage of Spantamad.A Librarian's Long and Carefree VacationWondrous TimesCyrus is likely to be a member of the Spantamad Darshan for the following reasons:
# Cyrus' known students were all members of Spantamad.
# In 'A Librarian's Long and Carefree Vacation', Lisa tells Gafoor that she will be at "the Darshan reunion," which is evidently for their Darshan, Spantamad. A few days later, Second Blooming Story The Akademiya Lisa attended the reunion, which Cyrus was present for. Lisa and Cyno were his students, and Cyno in particular was raised as Cyrus' foster son.
Profile
Change is the only constant.|speaker=Cyrus
Cyrus was a sage of great renown in Sumeru Akademiya, even having a quote on Bimarstan's Proverb Column, which contains quotes from the Akademiya's greatest scholars. As a professor, Cyrus had several students, including Lisa, Cyno, and Gafoor.Event Second Blooming NPC Dialogue: Lisa - Second Blooming Story The Akademiya The Akademiya
As a child, Cyno suffered greatly as a result of Hermanubis' power. Instead of treating Cyno as a test subject as his "higher-ups had hoped," Cyrus adopted Cyno and raised him as his son, something which Lisa suggests helped ease Cyrus' stubborn temperament.
When Lisa entered Sumeru Akademiya, he took a liking to her work early on and deemed her to be the greatest scholar the Akademiya had seen in 200 years. He invited her to join several major projects, but most of them ultimately failed due to trying to attain "wisdom beyond mortal understanding" at great cost. Disillusioned by the "lunacy" of these projects, Lisa decided to leave the Akademiya after she graduated a mere two years later. Cyrus evidently sympathized with her decision and never tried persuading her to stay.
In the manga, Lisa sent a letter to her "teacher" at Sumeru Akademiya regarding an ancient language she could not decipher, found in a Fatui document pertaining to the god remains inside Collei. Cyno was dispatched to Mondstadt in response, and he successfully sealed the remains. Afterwards, he took Collei back to Sumeru and left her in Tighnari's care.
Following his retirement, Cyrus now resides in the Bimarstan area. His residence is seen in the Wondrous Times, where Zaha Hadi is found angrily accusing Cyrus of sabotaging her tomato plant for a competition between fellow retired professors.

<title>Kaveh/Lore</title>
<text>A renowned architect from Sumeru who perhaps cares a bit too much about too many things. He is an aesthete troubled by reality.
Personality
A renowned architect from Sumeru who perhaps cares a bit too much about too many things. He is an aesthete troubled by reality.
Kaveh is a well-known Sumeru architect who is graduated from Kshahrewar with honors. He is a staunch defender of the arts and greatly appreciates aesthetics and artistic maturity in most things including architecture, interior designs, mechanics, and even storytelling.Puspa Café Message Board Kaveh and Alhaitham In contrast to Alhaitham's rationality, Kaveh operates by what he feels to be right, first and foremost.
Kaveh has quite the reputation among Akademiya students and Sumeru citizens and is described as a genius and talented architect. For example, Sasani, an NPC located in The Palace of Alcazarzaray, admires his masterpieceSasani and feels unfortunate for not having an honor to speak with him in person. Araby, an NPC found in front of the Pharos Lighthouse, and Nilou also praise his magnum opus.Araby Kaveh is characterized by Faruzan as a good kid with great potential and original ideas in his mind and Dori as being unique among Akademiya scholars in regards to being more open-minded. Alhaitham describes him as a light of the Kshahrewar and a master builder and craftsman. According to Alhaitham's Character Story, Alhaitham acknowledges Kaveh's exceptional brilliance and portrays him as a genius and an excellent mirror of himself. He also concludes that he possesses a personality and values that are not congruous with his abilities.
Kaveh seems to be thoughtful of others and shows great empathy towards people around him. He approaches people without hesitation if he suspects they're in trouble and even lends his hand by providing his Mora.Port Ormos Bulletin Board An Argument It is mentioned by Alhaitham that he is too considerate of others and is emotionally fragile.Although Alhaitham's English voice-lines say Kaveh tends to be overly sensitive about everyone, the definition of sensitive in here is more close to "displaying a quick and delicate appreciation of others' feelings" rather than "getting easily offended, or upset" as in original Chinese voice-lines describe him as being too considerate or thoughtful of others. Alhaitham even recounts a story where Kaveh purchased a dozens of handmade keychains that were being sold under the pretense that the proceeds would help feed hungry children. Kaveh states helping others make him happy and thinks mutual assistance, fairness, and righteous anger are also what drive the world. He also seems to be very passionate about his career and works his fingers to the bone to please his clients.Pride and Prejudice
Due to stark contrast in ideologies and personalities, Kaveh gets easily flustered when particularly dealing with Alhaitham. Kaveh and Alhaitham's clash in intense disagreements are shown in the game scenes, character's voice-lines, and even in the messages on bulletin boards across Sumeru City and Port Ormos. He is also notably unable to tolerate alcohol, easily becoming drunk in a few glasses.
Appearance
Gold Pinions in Flames Bathed
Kaveh uses the Tall Male Characters tall male model. He has distinct, medium-length blond hair with dirty blond ends and sharp eyes with red irises.
Official Introduction
Kaveh: Knowledge of comprehension, benevolence, and aesthetics
Mainstream Sumeru academia tends to hide a certain fact from time to time, which is that for some people, talent can occasionally be more of a burden instead. Nevertheless, this view can also be but an excuse. In truth, it is your character that determines your destiny first and foremost. The aforementioned ideas are the sort that Kaveh will persistently rebut.
A renowned architect from Sumeru, known as the Light of Kshahrewar. He is one of the most high-profile figures in the industry.
As a designer and an outstanding alumnus, Kaveh has quite the reputation among Akademiya students and is idolized as a role model by the students of Kshahrewar. Unfortunately, his career is not as plain-sailing as people imagine. The same can be said for many other facets of his life.
Titles, rumors, fame, and reputation... These are all mere by-products of his work. Equipped with astounding professional design skills, Kaveh puts his heart and soul into his work and is imbued with ideals and pursuits for aesthetics and architectonics. Designers are not in charge of the construction's final execution, yet they hold responsibility for all its aspects. Thus, be it design details, safety and security, or practicality, no effort may be spared in ensuring the quality of each aspect. On top of that, being one of the best in his field, Kaveh pays additional attention to the aesthetic and human elements that he is concerned about throughout the process. For him, designs that are completely divorced from reality should be classified as fantasy, whereas a building that is actually put into construction must have practical value.
That said, it is rather inconceivable that such an extraordinary architect could have been rendered bankrupt by a single project. Fortunately, very few know about this matter, and most of them keep it a secret. As for Kaveh himself, he is deathly afraid that the secret of his bankruptcy might ever leak out. It is thus fair to say that he is not really living his ideal life.
Character Stories
In a land brimming with as much talent as Sumeru, one is practically spoiled for choice when it comes to designers. But when one speaks of architects, few are those who will not subconsciously think of "Kaveh."
Up till today, one can hear Kshahrewar students discuss and speculate about their alumnus Kaveh at the Palace of Alcazarzaray and various parts of the Akademiya. In the hearts of his Darshan-mates, Kaveh is a genius nigh-unparalleled in the last few decades and an architect of great fame. Kaveh has, by his outstanding works, engraved his name into the history of the Akademiya. If you are to meet Kshahrewar students, it wouldn't hurt to listen to them extol his achievements: Single-handedly designing the Palace of Alcazarzaray, renovating the landmark lighthouse of Port Ormos, modifying the port's elevators and cargo-handling structures, his pioneering role in the spatial optimization of the peripheral areas surrounding forests and valleys... The list goes on.Clad in these achievements, Kaveh has become more than a simple name, but a synonym for achievement in the field of design. Many wish they could have a resume like his: brilliantly talented in school, invited to work in various major construction agencies after graduation, and leaving after several years to do work under his own name.All outsider readings of his life stop here, and almost none know of the hidden truth behind the stories - the truth that Kaveh himself is trying to hide. It is true, of course, that he is an exceptional designer. It is a shame, then, this has not allowed him to live the perfect life that others think he does.He would summarize his past experiences in this way: Misunderstandings are troublesome but inevitable. All people are vulnerable to momentary lapses in judgment and to the influence of rigid labels. For example, their first reaction to "designer" is the fantasy of someone who earns Mora with a flick of their fingers, who becomes famous with but a few strokes of a pen. And when people think about "the arts," the first thing that emerges is the bizarre, unfounded image of some lackadaisical, self-centered soul who swings between bouts of gloom and mania, and who is all too fond of bossing others about.Kaveh does not fit any such imaginative fantasies. He cannot complete his designs in a single stroke, instead approaching every job earnestly. He dresses like a successful person, but in truth, he does not judge the merit of a project by the remuneration alone. He is principled beyond most other people in Sumeru, believing that "art" is the wellspring of a life in design, and yet does not forsake humanistic purpose or practicality in the process. Indeed, he is willing to make some compromises for these two things. Sometimes, he compromises on rest time, other times it is the ornamentation and trappings of the project... and sometimes it is his own pay.After many years, he finally succeeded. The Palace of Alcazarzaray was completed, and he returned to Sumeru in glory. His colleagues had naught but praise for the fabled palace atop a large tree, stunned as they were by its designer's astounding imagination. They gorged themselves upon the way in which the structure united architectural function and human narrative into its elegant design values, resulting in luxurious craftsmanship that yet exists as a testament to precision and elegance, rewriting the atmosphere of the surrounding mountainous space with its very presence. No one would say that the Palace of Alcazarzaray was any less than an exceedingly successful experiment.Those colleagues, however, were blissfully unaware of how Kaveh went bankrupt over this project due to a mix of personal principle, the vagaries of life, and other problems layered atop one another. After all, the truth - much like the troubled gestation of this success - has remained well-hidden thanks to Kaveh's efforts.
Kaveh was born into a classic scholarly family in Sumeru. His father was from the Rtawahist Darshan and once worked at the Akademiya, while his mother had graduated from Kshahrewar, and much as he would become later in life, she too was a famous architect. Influenced by them, Kaveh was interested in architectural design from a young age. They would sit in the living room as he sat at home playing with the block puzzles they had bought for him.Theirs was a house in which words were not necessary, and Kaveh would gain his understanding of "home" from this time.However, their blissful days were not to last. Some time before he joined the Akademiya, his father would, at his encouragement, join the Interdarshan Championship. The competition itself was not a complicated affair, but his father, who became a favorite to win, would miss becoming champion by a hair, and then proceeded to go missing for a time afterward.Soon, the bad news came: His father had perished in an accident in the desert. The suddenness of this misfortune threw mother and son into disarray. His mother was hit particularly hard. Being a sensitive soul by nature, her husband's passing would cause her to break down, spending much time in anxious, gloomy thought. As for Kaveh, he would see his father's laugh and promise to bring something nice back for him as he walked out that door every time he closed his eyes to sleep. Young Kaveh thought that had he not said anything, his father might not have taken part in the contest, and he would not have gone missing afterward, and finally perished as a result. But no matter how he begged, the past could not be changed.His father's death, his mother's agony... all these things that could no longer be taken back were on the account of a single thing he had said. From that day forward, he would live under the shadow of that guilt.
After graduating, Kaveh's first project was helping out with a group project with other students of the same Darshan, though they had different mentors. This being his debut as the person responsible for design, the work weighed heavily on him. But he is (by his own admission) a stubborn person, and he would spend all his energy on his work, and thus would he shoulder the work for others, heedless of the hour, on all manner of projects for two entire years.Once he had gained enough experience, Kaveh left these cooperative projects behind to work in his own name, gaining a clientele who appreciated his style. Some would ask him to design buildings, and this marked the beginning of his career. By dint of his hard work, he was able to save up a good sum of Mora. It did not take long, however, for Kaveh to hit a bottleneck. The demands of the market were very different from academic design. It was more pragmatic, more snobbish, and the clients' requirements were far harder to meet than his mentors' had been. At the same time, academic trends in Sumeru were disrupting his work. He began to realize that his ideals and career goals were, as a certain someone had said, not easily attainable.New iterations of the schools of thought and viewpoints amongst researchers were constantly being created, and there was no lack of those who would engage in self-critique and self-reflexive questioning, with changes and improvements in social factors encouraging such considerations. As such, things that were once recommended might someday become objects of criticism, whether they be actual books or art.But other than those who had given themselves wholly over to art, no one could understand what artists in Sumeru had to endure. As academic accomplishment became ever more prized in Sumeru, researchers would in turn value pure academic accomplishments and practical skills more highly. The Six Sages would grow ever more radical in their ways, and the idea that "the arts provide no real benefits" started to become mainstream. Thus, those who worked in the arts would be marginalized, and those subjects that were often related to the arts sought to distance themselves.The engineering projects that Kaveh came into contact with were highly streamlined, bereft of flair or style. He would suggest various beautiful designs, only to have them rejected on the grounds that they were "meaningless presentation," or that "this project only needs practical buildings." His original pursuit was to make good designs for all that incorporated both artistic beauty and practicality, but now that the arts had become a joke, and people rejected their necessity and value, no one would give him freedom to work on his designs. Kaveh, believing that architecture was indeed art, resolutely opposed such viewpoints. But his job required him to have technical support and investments, and so he could not escape these circles, nor could he simply put his views out there in the open for fear that he might drag too many others down with him.With his dreams and career now at odds, Kaveh gave himself a long vacation. But when he returned home, he received an unexpected letter from Fontaine. It was from his mother, and she wrote that she had found someone to whom she could entrust the rest of her life, and as such was going to remarry in Fontaine. It was this news that she would, with great trepidation and expectation, relate to her only relative.Kaveh wrote back and congratulated her, and would even go to Fontaine to take part in the wedding. It was a simple affair, and only a few guests were present. Seeing his mother smile once more, Kaveh felt glad, but felt lost again almost immediately afterwards.His mother would leave all her property in Sumeru to him. Three days later, he would return to Sumeru, and once again felt the terror of the empty home - the mere act of sitting on the sofa tormented him with heretofore unmatched solitude. Here, he felt the old adage of all wise scholars being fulfilled: "Do the right thing, no matter what it costs you."
The more he continued to work in the construction industry, the stronger Kaveh's displeasure with the current state of society grew. It was at this moment that a turning point came. The wealthy merchant, Lord Sangemah Bay, sought him out to construct a private mansion.Lord Sangemah Bay had become fairly famous, but Kaveh had no idea that this "Lord"'s name was in fact Dori until they met, nor did he have any reckoning of her power and riches. She only had two conditions for this mansion, that it be large and extravagant. Kaveh would probe her concerning design style and other details, but she was unconcerned with such. Even amongst his clients, Dori stood out as a bit of an oddity. She did business, but seemed to care little for what researchers thought. She wanted her mansion built in a secluded place - for business needs, or so she claimed - and Kaveh was told not to ask too many questions and simply aim to make a truly awe-inspiring estate. As for aesthetics, Dori neither cared for nor stopped him from doing anything he wished.Kaveh realized almost immediately how rare it was to come by such a commission. A mansion construction project without limitations meant that he could put his all into it. Party A would fork out the resources, while Party B would do the work - was this not how their business should be? And was allowing academic views to restrict development and growth not utterly wrong-headed? So it was with that Kaveh threw himself in planning these designs with a sudden fervor, and, in his role as "Party B," he advised Dori to make some adjustments. A true mogul could not simply live in the mountains. If this estate was to go down in history, it had to be something of truly legendary beauty! A garden was a must, with the flowers carefully selected, of course, with the input of professional botanists. The conceptualization must be bold, the planning conscientious. The buildings themselves would prioritize practicality, but the requested warehouses and facilities would rest upon a luxuriant foundation. And as for location... the cliff-side in the northern mountains looked good. Lord Sangemah Bay would awaken every day with a window onto the loveliest natural views that could be had.Though Dori would constantly insist that the mansion did not have to be close to a cliff, Kaveh's engineering spirit and aesthetic appetites drove him on to convince her otherwise. Thus did the project begin with a flourish, and as the days passed, work proceeded apace under Kaveh's watchful eye.Yet his ideals would not be so easily achieved, for though Kaveh's diligence in selecting a site had been immaculate, and he had made every consideration, he could not have anticipated the speed at which the Withering would expand its reach that year. When the work was 70% complete, on a quiet night, the Withering crept in silently, destroying all that had been built overnight. The sight of his creation's devastated corpse struck Kaveh like a furious thunderbolt. Dori, who had rushed down upon receiving the news, was in incomparable fury, demanding that Kaveh leave the project. Though the Forest Rangers quickly dispersed The Withering, the buildings were beyond saving.Yet he knew that it would be difficult to ever get a chance of this sort again, and so he begged Dori to let him finish the Palace of Alcazarzaray. Dori would point out the crucial problem with stark sharpness: He had been the one to insist on the change of site. Now that the palace had been destroyed, taking the investment put in thus far with it, how could the project continue, even assuming that she did not pursue the matter with him? If they were to rebuild the structure, who would bear the cost for the losses?Kaveh sat atop the ruins as he contemplated this all night long. He had his savings, and the property his parents had left behind. That had once been his "home," but now, it was just an empty building. And what was a "home," anyway? An architect like him knew better than most that a construction bereft of a family or people to dwell in it was no "home." It was simply a building.When the sun rose, Kaveh returned to Sumeru City and sold that house. Adding all the proceeds from that sale, along with his savings, to the funds Dori had provided with him, he was able to come up with 70% of the necessary Mora required, with Dori coming up with the rest.Thus was the Palace of Alcazarzaray built on a beautiful, sunny day. Kaveh had given all he possessed to build a legendary palace that did not belong to him in the slightest. He did not earn a single Mora on this project. On the contrary, some slight overspending on the follow-up work would leave him heavily in debt to Dori. While Kaveh made a token show of resisting, he knew in his heart that he could not deny the fact that he did indeed owe this debt. His heart was once again consumed by that old guilt, and Lord Sangemah Bay, shrewd merchant that she was, could immediately perceive that he was paying not for her sake, but for that of his ideals.And if someone wanted to martyr their entire fortune on the altar of their ideals, who was she to stop them? Construction was ultimately just business, but ideals were priceless. As for how Kaveh would come to be homeless afterward, that is a different story.
After going bankrupt, Kaveh entered into a period of melancholy. The Palace of Alcazarzaray had ever so briefly filled the hole in his heart that had been ripped open by so many things, but it had also proved to him once again that no matter what he gave to attain his ideals, it wasn't enough. He was now directionless, and enmeshed in a world where he could not go anywhere without Mora. And yet he was accustomed since his youth to putting on a brave front, and so Kaveh was unwilling to let his colleagues and friends know that he was nigh penniless even after selling all he owned, and so he went to a tavern, where he would order a few bottles and chat to comfort himself. One bottle later, he would collapse at the table, only to wake up in the exact same position afterward.Lambad, the tavern owner, had reserved a seat and a few free drinks for him out of kindness, and as thanks, Kaveh helped him redesign and refit the booth seating area of the tavern's second floor. He would occasionally meet friends from his Akademiya schooling days, and with them he would pretend that he was just here to drink and gather inspiration. He would spend over a fortnight in this manner, during which he would encounter that friend that he no longer called "friend."When discussing Kaveh's old friends, the current Akademiya Scribe, Alhaitham of Haravatat, will invariably get mentioned. Alhaitham enrolled at a later date than most of those his age, but his grades stood out above the rest. People didn't know who he was or where to find him normally, only that he was some student who had gotten high marks. And when his name was mentioned, even the old researchers from Kshahrewar would shake their heads and say that he was too intelligent by half and hard to get along with.At that time, Kaveh had just parted ways with his mother and was living alone. He would meet this junior student in the library at times, and would speak to him out of curiosity, and thus did he meet the Haravatat genius Alhaitham. But time would go on to prove that wishful thinking alone does not friends make. For Kaveh quickly realized that Alhaitham, though two years his junior and admittedly both extremely talented and incredibly gifted, was also utterly different from him, whether it be in personality, dealing with people, academic direction, and convictions.Kaveh's time in school would leave him with a great many memories, the least pleasant of which is the group project they undertook together. Each recognized the other's ability, and they decided to conduct research regarding ancient structures, ancient runes, and linguistics, with Kaveh suggesting that Alhaitham be the one responsible for selecting the topic. At first, others would take also take part in the cooperative project, but as the work progressed, the other students dropped out gradually as they could not keep up.That was the first time Kaveh realized the brutal and all-too-intuitive difference in talent between individuals. The Akademiya linked talent and resources to an extreme degree, and all here knew that. As Alhaitham liked to put it, certain matters have their upper limit determined by talent and their lower bound determined by hard work. Ordinary people and geniuses would be separated by various practical realities, and they did not have to force themselves to fit into a group they did not belong to. Kaveh, however, was resolute in his belief that this was all the result of obstacles that appeared during the process, and that wisdom should be uncovered by many people. To prevent the other students from backing out, Kaveh spent much time and effort helping them with their work, placing a great burden on his own shoulders. Alhaitham persisted in upholding the opposite view, believing Kaveh to be too idealistic in his ways - academia was not charity work, and temporary salvation would not change the reality of their differences in ability. Thus did discord arise between the two.Finally, the day came when only two people remained working on the topic: Alhaitham and Kaveh. The disputes between them accumulated to a critical mass before exploding spectacularly. Kaveh maintained that Alhaitham was too much of an egoist, that he could be much better welcomed amongst people if he would just care about helping out more often. Alhaitham for his part pointed out that Kaveh's impractical idealism was just a flight from reality, and that it would come to be a burden on his existence someday, and the source of Kaveh's altruism was naught but his inescapable sense of guilt. At that moment, more than anything else, Kaveh felt cut to the quick by someone who was his best friend. Alhaitham had seen through the reality that he had never been able to face, causing him to feel reality's bite for the first time, a feeling that made Kaveh steadfastly declare that he regretted making friends with this all-too-intelligent person.

Though all of us might claim to have a place in this great hall of learning, we must understand that it is people, and not knowledge, that make our world what it is. Without a vessel, knowledge shall have no home. Universal values must naturally have some merit to be named such, and denying their general meaning does not mean that minority viewpoints will arise accordingly. This is the case with aesthetics. Beauty is something objective that exists in human hearts. It will not lose its value simply because some people cannot understand it."To view oneself as some mighty vessel is to fall to the narrowness of the researcher. Know that truth has never existed for the sake of individuals. The logic of the world coexists with nature, and this will not easily change whether it is interpreted as such or not. Excessive belief in the object is self-disclosure just the same, a manifestation of a lack of confidence in the subject. Moreover, one who is sufficiently self-confident will not need to constantly use plural forms of address, such as 'we.' I alone am sufficient to sustain this position - this I can assert."Page 56: A hand-drawn sketch of the Akademiya.

While he was still a student, Kaveh would often be busy with various projects. During this time, he would visit numerous ruins with fellow students. They were all very young at the time, and were as yet unable to descend to the heart of the tombs, but they managed to achieve significant results nonetheless.However, the study of ancient ruins comes with its risks, and they would find themselves imperiled despite their professionalism. During one such search, the student team encountered some danger, and there was a cave-in. If not for Kaveh pushing two fellow Kshahrewar students out of the tomb, they would surely have died there. As for Kaveh himself, though he also escaped with some light injuries, he could not stop his fellow students' change of heart. He believed that he was helping them achieve results, but instead most of his fellow students saw only a perceived difference in ability, and troubled by the situation, they elected to quit the project.Kaveh knew of the objects known as "Visions." He had originally thought that they would appear at moments of crisis, but he had been through one such mortal crisis already, he had not received the favor of the gods, but instead had to use all his strength to drag everyone out of the fire.Years later, Kaveh graduated, left the Akademiya, and threw himself into his work. He had by then ceased to think about Visions for some time, or even consider further as to what kind of people would come into possession of such an item. People said that only those with a wish could receive divine favor this way - perhaps he was just not such a person.Everything that happened after flowed like a stream of water, dull and unchanging. He would busy himself with design work, for a while becoming overwhelmed, with the lack of acknowledgment of the arts causing him to feel fatigued. His mother would set up a new family in Fontaine, leaving the house and her other possessions to him, her son... He could do nothing about these things, and they also felt unremarkable and unworthy of mention.This persisted till the day the first version of the Palace of Alcazarzaray was destroyed by The Withering, and he was sitting upon the wreck of that building, contemplating the whole night through. Suddenly, he would resolve to boldly bet it all on chasing the dream before him, come what may. Thus did he return home and quickly hit up the relevant departments to put things in order. Coincidentally, that day was a smooth one for transactions, and Kaveh spent only half a day transferring ownership of his house, coming to possess a sum of Mora that he would later redirect into that project.After settling a host of trivial matters, Kaveh would return to the old home he had lived in for many years for the final time. He would use flatbread to place a simplified Palace of Alcazarzaray upon his plate, drizzled with sauce and yogurt, making himself a beautiful snack in the process.This dish was not hard, and he had been taught to make it by his father in his youth. He had not made that dish much since his father's passing, and it was merely impulse that guided him to give it a try that day.

<title>Riftwolf</title>
<text>Ominous, alien beasts with dull colors that travel in packs much as wolves do.It is said that they have the power to dissolve the world's borders.
Riftwolves, also known as Wolves of the RiftWolves of the Rift handbook=1 or Rifthounds, are an Elite Enemy elite enemy group hailing from the Abyss. They are mainly found in Tsurumi Island, Inazuma but can also be found in The Chasm (Subregion) The Chasm, Enkanomiya, Sumeru, Fontaine, and Wolvendom (after completing Lupus Minor Chapter: The Meaning of Lupical Act I).
In combat, Riftwolves use elemental attacks and apply the corrosion status on hit, which continuously drains HP from all party members. Rifthounds also utilize a fury system; the more they are attacked by the element they're associated with, they will enter an Elemental Devourer state, causing them to attack more aggressively at the cost of decreased RES to that element.

Lore
Riftwolves are monsters from the Abyss that are said to be able to erode the boundaries of the world. They were created by the alchemist Rhinedottir Gold who classified them as "Alfisol,"Thundercraven Rifthound WhelpRockfond Rifthound Whelp however the Golden Wolflord was an unintentional creation.Golden Wolflord Riftwolves were once prevalent throughout Teyvat during the cataclysm, where they were the advance guard for the other monsters that were behind them.Cleansing Light They are said to behave biologically similar to wolves.Rockfond Rifthound
After the cataclysm, the riftwolves were driven to low numbers by numerous hunts and resistances, but have started to re-emerge once more, initially on Tsurumi Island. A group of riftwolves also appeared in Wolvendom and began to cause havoc to the surrounding area.The Meaning of Lupical
In the Khvarena of Good and Evil, Riftwolves are described as "echoes left from the battles fought so many years ago," remnants of the disasters that plagued the Sumeru Desert at the time of the cataclysm. Small pockets of riftwolves can be found across Sumeru.
Small pockets of riftwolves can also be found in Fontaine, appearing through Beastly Rifts that were present on Elynas until they were removed by the Traveler. A large riftwolf nest had also inhabited the Roots of Erinnyes; coupled with a Root-Consuming Tumor, their presence caused the tree to become sickened, turning from bright blue to a dark yellow color. This nest and the tumor was exterminated by the Traveler and a Primordial Bathysmal Vishap.</text>

<title>Yun Family</title>
<text>The Yun family or house of Yun zh=云氏 'Yún-shì', 云家 'Yún-jiā' was a notable family in Liyue which ran a family forge five hundred years ago, collaborating with Han Wu of the Han Family to create the Prototype Series weapons.Prototype Archaic
Over the centuries, however, the family would shift focus from weaponsmithing to the performing arts, and by Yun Jin's generation, few of its members still practice forging.
History
Origins
Little is currently known about the Yun family's origins, but its two named members who lived during the Timeline 500 cataclysm were the family's seventh and eighth family heads,Blackcliff Warbow and the family forge had been in operation for hundreds of years at this point.Blackcliff Warbow note=Chinese mini=1 zh=云凰辗转难眠，恐怕云家百年有余的锻兵传承要在她手中断绝。 zh_tl=Yun Huang tossed and turned, unable to sleep, afraid that the Yun family legacy which had persisted for hundreds of years would end with her.
It appears every generation of the Yun family practiced martial arts, with polearms and bows among their known specialties.Prototype Starglitter
A certain generation of the Yun family came to possess the Eye of Perception, an item that originated from the adepti, after it landed in Liyue's marketplace through unknown means. Its owner encountered an exorcist named Huang, who sought the guidance of the adepti, and gifted it to him.Eye of Perception
Post-Cataclysm
When the monster threat was resolved, a martial arts renaissance began, which caused a lot of demand for weaponry that manufacturers couldn't keep up with. To solve the issue, Yun Hui, the head of the Yun family at the time, approached the master craftsman Han Wu in order to revolutionize their craft. The two conducted extensive research and Han Wu used that research to draw up the Prototype Series prototype designs.Prototype Rancour Initially this only included a longsword, a greatsword and a polearm. When the polearm was made, Yun Hui dedicated it to his father because the tip glowed like a star. Yun Hui personally requested a bow be added to the prototypes, so Han Wu gathered a large variety of resources to experiment with and made a bow for the series.Prototype Crescent Some time afterward the thaumaturges came to Yun Hui asking him to make a new kind of catalyst. He agreed and alongside Han Wu used the Cor Purum they gave him to make a catalyst and named it 'Prototype Amber', adding it to the prototype series.Prototype Amber
After some time, Yun Hui became one of the Liyue Qixing, stepping down as head of the family. In accordance to the family custom, his only child, a daughter named Yun Huang, would marry and have her husband become the head of the house. Huang, as a headstrong martial artist ever since childhood, refused that option and took over the family's business operations herself. But unfortunately for her, she took over during a time when the land was plagued by earthquakes, threatening her business if she can't reliably get ore. As she was worrying, Han Ce visits her and shows her his father's added notes on the prototype designs, promising that the problem will be resolved via blackcliff.
Sometime later, a thaumaturge visited Yun Huang, and after she sent for Han Ce the thaumaturge gave them a piece of crimson Cor Purum in order to help Liyue through this time of rampant earthquakes. They made a catalyst using this Cor Purum and used it as an indicator of tectonic activity so that people knew when it was safe to go into the mines.Blackcliff Agate
Present
Generations later, the Yun Family has changed its focus to Liyue Opera and has maintained the Yun-Han Opera Troupe since at least Yun Jin's grandfather's generation.

<title>Adventurers' Guild</title>
<text>They boldly venture "up to the stars, down to the abyss," or so their motto would have you believe. In truth, they take on jobs ranging from finding kittens to exploring domains. Well, you cannot afford to gaze at the stars or the abyss without an honest job. World Map description
The Adventurers' Guild, indicated by  icon on the map, is an organization that serves as an adventurer-for-hire service for the people and other organizations in the seven nations of Teyvat. The Guild collates all the complex word-of-mouth information it receives and redistributes it in the form of quests and adventures assigned to adventurers.
Little is known about the origins of the Adventurers' Guild. However, based on Lan's dialogue, the guild's main headquarters is based in Snezhnaya.
By speaking to Katheryne, the player can:
# Claim Bonus Daily Commission Rewards
# Claim Adventure Rank Rewards
# Dispatch Characters on Expeditions
Organization
Ad astra abyssosque!
The guild has several branches throughout Teyvat, one for each of the major regions. Each branch has a branch master who is in charge of formulating entrance exams for new adventurers.Adventurer's Entrance Exam
The guild has two known departments, which are:
* Intelligence Department
* Recruitment Department
Intelligence Department
The Intelligence department of the Adventurers' Guild typically does not undertake commissions. Instead, they provide adventurers with vital information that they can use to complete their commissions. This department is split into two groups: the investigators and the organizers. The investigators are in the field and handle the collection of information, while the organizers take all of the information gathered by the investigators and organize it before providing it to adventurers.Alfry
The organizers ranks the commissions based on difficulty (from Rank S to, presumably, Rank D) to help new adventurers adjust to the adventurer lifestyle, while also supporting veteran adventurers and allowing them to adventure more freely.Adventurous Acquaintance
The adventurers handle the commissions taken to the guild.
Branches
Mondstadt Branch
The Mondstadt Branch of the Adventurers' Guild, led by Cyrus, has a severe need for members. The message board in the Angel's Share is filled with recruitment ads from the guild. Cyrus even uses stories of dangerous adventures and bravery as a recruitment tactic towards the youth.</text>

<title>Changsheng</title>
<text>Changsheng zh=长生 zh_rm=Chángshēng is Baizhu's pet snake, often seen wrapped around his neck. She first appears in the Guizhong (Quest).
Profile
Appearance
Changsheng is a white snake with dark pink eyes. Her eyes were originally golden and slitted, but took their current form when she made a contract with Baizhu. She is often seen wrapped around Baizhu's neck.
Story
Long ago, Changsheng lived in the mountains of Chenyu Vale. One day, a desperate doctor who had lost his family to a deadly plague had traveled to the Vale, searching for the Herblord. Arriving at the Herblord's residence, he found only an extremely weakened white snake. Changsheng offered to make the contract known as the "Way of the Dragon-Dragging Jade Snake" and teach him her secret arts of healing, while also warning that though it would give him powerful healing abilities, it would also harm his own health. Despite the risks, the doctor accepted and the two bonded their lives together, their eyes swapping with each other. Using his own lifeforce and Changsheng, the doctor saved many, at great cost to himself. Before his death, he passed down Changsheng and her contract to his disciple.
The doctor's successors used their lifeforce to save countless lives, at the cost of their own. This cycle continued for generations and had at least four successors. When Baizhu's master was on his final days, he sought to use the art to save Jialiang, the husband of his disciple Jiangli, from a rare congenital heart condition. Jiangli refused, as she saw Changsheng's lifeforce manipulation as evil and unnatural, and didn't want him to sacrifice his life for hers, as she cared about him too. Her pleas shook the man and made him question his views, as she'd made him realize that his life and the lives of Changsheng's other contractors were just as valuable as the lives of the patients they sacrificed themselves to save. In his final moments, he left a letter to Baizhu in which he asked him a single thing: "May you find a remedy for this conundrum, which has ailed us so..."
While they stood in front of his master's grave, Baizhu and Changsheng had a conversation. She showed regret at her inability to save her contractors, while Baizhu asked what would happen if he refused the contract and left her without a host. When she said she'd spend her final moments sleeping at Mount Yaojun and wait to be reunited with her late friends, Baizhu accepted the contract to preserve Changsheng's life, to her slight regret. When she showed fear over how many more would accept the contract and give their lives, Baizhu promised her that none would do so and that the contract would end with him. Baizhu was determined to become immortal, and this determination resulted in him being granted a Vision.

<title>Alain Guillotin</title>
<text>Update 4.2 lore
Alain Guillotin was a historical figure from the cataclysm around 400–500 years ago. He was a member of the Narzissenkreuz Institute before its disbandment, a researcher of the Institute of Natural Philosophy, and a Marechaussee Phantom Marechaussee Hunter, and later went on to establish the Fontaine Research Institute (full name "Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering").
Profile
Alain was noted to be a very rigid and serious person, who only seemed to care about his research. He was known as a child prodigy, and became a researcher at the Institute of Natural Philosophy at a much younger age than his own research assistant, Carter Scherbius. However, he was very close to his adoptive sister, Mary-Ann, as well as Jakob, Rene, and Carter.
Alain's primary research focus was Khaenri'ah machines such as Ruin Graders, but he also researched technology from the era of King Deshret.
He was raised in the Narzissenkreuz Institute until the Basil Elton Vice Director departed for battle during the cataclysm. Later, Alain and Mary-Ann were adopted by Emanuel Guillotin under the request of Basil Elton.Veteran's Visage His friendship with Rene de Petrichor and Jakob Ingold lasted for years, until the two led a failed procedure on his assistant, Carter Scherbius, during their time in the Institute of Natural Philosophy, causing a rift between them.Enigmatic Page (V)
Alain later joined the Marechaussee Phantom alongside Mary-Ann. The two were one day assigned to capture the members of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, when Master and Jakob's schemes had caught the attention of the Court of Fontaine.Enigmatic Page (XII) A clash broke out within the remains of Elynas between the siblings and the leaders of the Ordo, Master, which presumably killed Mary-Ann.Limner, Dreamer, and Robotic Dog

Alain was raised in the Narzissenkreuz Institute until its Basil Elton Vice Director died during the cataclysm, and the Institute was disbanded. At the request of Basil Elton, Alain was taken in by Emanuel Guillotin, together with Mary-Ann. He enrolled into the Institute of Natural Philosophy in pursuit of mechanical research, where he was highly revered as a child prodigy, but also envied for his talents.Enigmatic Page (II) Following Rene and Jakob's return, he recommended them to the director of Institute, leading to a temporary collaboration between the three on Alain's project.Interactable: Ancient Log Ancient Log  1 Ancient Log  1Interactable: Institute of Natural Philosophy Ancient Notes Ancient Notes During their time in the Institute, the three, along with Mary-Ann, also developed a close relationship to Alain's sickly assistant, Carter Scherbius.Interactable: Ancient Log Ancient Log  2 Ancient Log  2Enigmatic Page (IV)
In time, however, Alain discovered that Jakob and Rene had secretly been conducting experiments using Elynas' remains and had even experimented on Carter in an attempt to save his life, a procedure which caused his body to begin rapidly deteriorating. Carter's subsequent death led Alain to completely sever his relationship with the two.Book of Esoteric Revelations
The Guillotin siblings later became members of the Marechaussee Phantom. After the tragedy with Carter and joining the Marechausee Phantom, Alain, inspired by Carter's idea of a "thinking Kamera", created a Recon Log Mek mechanical assistant prototype and named it Seymour, tasking to always accompany and protect Mary-Ann.Masterpiece's OvertureThe Final Question
When the Court of Fontaine officially declared the Narzissenkreuz Ordo a threat, The director of the Institute of Natural Philosophy, Dwight Lasker, entrusted Alain's adoptive father Emanuel to investigate the Ordo.Interactable: Institute of Natural Philosophy Ancient Investigative Report Ancient Investigative Report Emanuel was eventually dissolved by the leader of Ordo, Master.Forgotten Vessel From victims' memories, Master learned that Alain had introduced simple logic trees for clockwork meka to execute commands. Master thought that "with the right organ, consciousness can be transplanted." Seymour utilized a "virtual neural network" for "thinking, security and surveillance applications," which caught the Master's attention. However, Jakob got emotional because he does not wish to oppose the Guillotin siblings.
the Master used the "Book of Revealing" to show Alain the calculated destruction after the cataclysm and the impending apocalypse, attempted to persuade Alain to join their plan to save human civilization. The Master proposed lending Alain's strength, making him a part of the Master. However, Alain refused the Master, saying, "it seems that there's no going back." and left.Scattered Page The Master felt displeased by Alain's refusal but still provided a place for him and Mary-Ann's future.
Master rallied the members of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo and led them to Elynas' remnants to carry out their orders. Alongside Master and Jakob, the entire Ordo engaged in a large-scale battle against the Marechaussee Hunters, which included Alain, Mary-Ann, and Seymour with their clockwork meka. During the battle, an explosion was triggered by someone, which greatly damaged Seymour and likely led to Mary-Ann's death. The outcome of the battle was the defeat of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo. Master was defeated by Alain and "[fell] into the chasm that dissolves all things." At the last moment, Rene's consciousness told Alain that he "will surely return to save all souls."Fell Dragon's Monocle Jakob managed to survive the incident and survives to the present day.
Sometime after leaving the Marechaussee Phantom, Alain established the Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering. He named the Suppression Specialist Mek after Carter to commemorate him.Recon Log MekAssault Specialist Mek
According to legend, Alain retired from the Fontaine Research Institute in his old age and isolated himself in his workshop, focusing on nothing but his research. However, none of it was ever published and from the traces left behind in his workshop, it can only be inferred that something was built.
Legacy
Alain invented the Arkhe Arkhe systemYouTube:  and founded the Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering. He is hailed as a genius and some of his inventions, notably the Clockwork Meka, are still being produced in Fontaine's factories in the present day.
According to legend, he invented a Seymour prototype machine that was capable of speech and thought to help his Mary-Ann younger sister's work as a member of the Marechaussee Phantom. This inspired the engineers of Fontaine to develop artificial intelligence, although none has ever succeeded.Aquabus Dialogue: Aeval</text>

<text>Dodoco is Klee's stuffed doll and good friend, made by her mother Alice.
Appearance
Dodoco resembles a white furry rabbit with a teardrop-like, fluffy tail. Moreover, it is attached to a chain which hangs from the side of Klee's backpack.
Overview
Dodoco apparently means "best friend."Dodoco Tales According to a story told by Alice, the Dodocos of the Dodo Clan have long lived on the Golden Apple Archipelago. Moreover, they were "peace-loving" and "playful." Also according to Alice, when a Dodoco is born it "rides the wind and goes off on a big adventure."A Story for You Residents of "Dodoland," which may refer to the Dodo Clan, eat roasted apples with jam.Dodoco's Dodo Stove

Kaboomball Kombat
The event Kaboomball Kombat also features items named with "Dodo." Players faced off against Dodofortresses and used Dodoguards to reflect Kaboomballs.
Dodofortresses share features with Dodoco, as noted by Paimon,Big Badaboom Battle but like the Heartbreak Balloon, they have narrowed eyes and a red band around the middle with a zigzagging pattern. Dodofortresses are also shown in the namecard Celebration: Kaboomball, which mentions a faraway kingdom called the Grand Alliance where the people could throw Kaboomballs. It is unclear if this is also related to the story of the Dodo Clan and the Golden Apple Archipelago.

<title>Khaenri'ah</title>
<text>Khaenri'ah was a nation without a god - not because it had a god that died or abandoned them, but because it never had a god to begin with. It was a powerful nation, built purely by humans, an unprecedented flourishing and glorious civilization - it was the pride of humankind. Dainsleif, "A Herald Without Adherents"
Khaenri'ah, also known as the Kingdom of Khaenri'ah or Dahri, is a region that is not part of the continent of Teyvat and is not under the purview of The Seven.
Khaenri'ah is most importantly known for its role in the "cataclysm" 500 years ago. During this time, monsters created by the alchemist Rhinedottir, also known as "Gold," poured out from Khaenri'ah to invade Teyvat, and Khaenri'ah was eventually destroyed by Celestia and the gods. Afterwards, all Khaenri'ahns who were not "pure-blooded" were turned into monsters, where as all "pure-blooded" Khaenri'ahns were cursed with immortality.Fortune-Mocking Pedigree Eide: [...] When the cataclysm came, we pure-blood Khaenri'ahns were declared the "greater sinners." Upon us, the gods placed the curse of immortality...
But those whose ancestry belonged to the domains of other gods were punished with the curse of the wilderness as they fled, turning them into monsters.
Despite its destruction and the transformation of many of its people into monsters, Khaenri'ah is still inhabited by humans to this day. Dainsleif - a denizen of Khaenri'ah and the narrator of Travail - describes it as one of "the hidden corners where the gods' gaze does not fall," and says that its people "dream of dreaming," unlike the majority who are "content to live, and not to dream."
According to Kaeya, it is said that Khaenri'ah is located deep underground somewhere near Sumeru.Destined Encounter Kaeya: [...]And my roots... They're in Khaenri'ah, which is said to have been located deep underground somewhere near Sumeru. The Khaenri'ahn installation known as Hangeh Afrasiyab guards a giant, tightly sealed stone gate beneath it that most likely leads to Khaenri'ah.Gate of Everlasting Mourning
Archon Quest Chapter ?? takes place in this region.
Description
quote   = In the perpetual meantime of a sheltered eternity, most are content to live, and not to dream.But in the hidden corners where the gods' gaze does not fall, there are those who dream of dreaming.Some say a few are chosen and the rest are dregs, but I say we humans have our humanity.We will defy this world with a power from beyond.
speaker = Dainsleif
Khaenri'ah is dark underground and mostly barren of natural life. What little is currently known about Khaenri'ah largely comes from weapon and artifact descriptions, as well as books found throughout the world. According to Dainsleif, it is the "pride of humanity", as it was built purely by humans without involvement from any god, until later it was destroyed by the gods 500 years ago.A Herald Without Adherents

Around 500 years ago, Irmin King Irmin introduced forbidden knowledge to enhance the kingdom's technological advancement. The alchemist Rhinedottir also used it in her experiments to develop powerful creatures containing the power of the Abyss, including Durin, Elynas (NPC) Elynas, and the Riftwolves. For some reason, these creatures began wreaking havoc throughout Khaenri'ah and then spilled out into the rest of Teyvat.Breeze Amidst the Forest

A third Archon, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata died after mostly purifying the surge of forbidden knowledge that contaminated Irminsul and creating her successor, Lesser Lord Kusanali, from the tree's purest branch.Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies
Mondstadt's Knights of Favonius, then led by Grand Master Arundolyn, led an expedition into Khaenri'ah to quell the monsters. His best friend and rival, Rostam, fell in battle during the cataclysm, leaving Arundolyn greatly bereaved. Other notable figures who are known for fighting against the monsters include Viridescent and the Signora Crimson Witch of Flames. While the initial surge of monsters was eventually suppressed, hilichurls continue to spawn throughout Teyvat.
In the present, Khaenri'ah continues its struggle against the effects of the curse. Kaeya, their "last hope," was sent to Mondstadt for the sake of an "ancient plot," infiltrating the Ragnvindr Clan by being abandoned at the Dawn Winery. The ultimate reason behind Kaeya being placed as a "sleeper" in Mondstadt by forces from Khaenri'ah is unknown.
Abyss Order
Abyss Order
The Abyss Order originates from the destruction of Khaenri'ah by the gods; it seeks to destroy the countries under the protection of The Seven in revenge.Dishonorable Trial The people of Khaenri'ah turned into the monsters of the Abyss.A Soul Set Apart Thus, it is thought that Abyss Mages, Abyss Heralds, and Abyss Lectors were once people from Khaenri'ah, possibly its aristocracy and knights / defending people.
Art of Khemia
Art of Khemia
quote   = Khaenri'ah was an underground realm, and its natural fauna were few indeed. As such, its alchemy focused more heavily on the creation of life. This art of creation was known as "The Art of Khemia."
speaker = Albedo
The Art of Khemia is an advanced type of alchemy developed in Khaenri'ah which allows for the creation of life itself. Five hundred years ago, the Art of Khemia was a major contributing factor behind the cataclysm and the fall of Khaenri'ah.
The only known practitioners of the Art of Khemia are Rhinedottir and Albedo, her student and successful attempt to create a synthetic human.
Automatons
Automatons
Ruin Machines were made as weapons of war by the people of Khaenri'ah. The most common type, Ruin Guards, were code-named "Field Tillers" by the people of Khaenri'ah. After the nation's downfall, the machines migrated across Teyvat. Though dangerous, they now lack any planned purpose.
Khaenri'ahns
The people of Khaenri'ah were changed into creatures of the Abyss in the cataclysm that destroyed the dynasty 500 years as a result of the curse. However, pure-blooded Khaenri'ahns were instead given a curse of immortality, preventing them from aging but still suffering from apparent erosion. The others, who hailed from the lands of the gods, were instead transformed into various creatures; a majority turned into hilichurls, but others instead appeared to turn into Abyss mages, heralds or lectors. The royal guard of Khaenri'ah, The Black Serpents, were instead eroded into either Shadowy Husks or still remained as the Black Serpents, but with a different form and suffering from erosion. The erosion was not complete, as some hilichurls were aware of the powers of a fountain in the Chasm and went there to "die" peacefully, while Halfdan and his subordinates remembered their duties to protect the people of Khaenri'ah.Requiem of the Echoing Depths
Kaeya's family, the Alberich Clan, were the Regents of Khaenri'ah after the Catalysm. It is unclear the number of generations between Kaeya and the Catalysm. It is also unclear why Kaeya is unaffected by the curse.
Other persons associated with the state include Pierro,Mocking MaskThe Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call Rhinedottir, and possibly Albedo by extension.

<title>Akame Kanenaga</title>
<text>Akame Kanenaga ja=赤目兼長 ja_rm=Akame Kanenaga was a historical figure from Inazuma and a member of the Akame School during Kaedehara Yoshinori's, Kaedehara Kazuha's great-grandfather, time. During the Case of the Eccentric, he aided Scaramouche's plan to undermine the Raiden Gokaden by abandoning the Isshin Art and going on a self-imposed exile to Snezhnaya.
After learning of the Isshin Art's decline as a result of the incident, Kanenaga forged the Kagotsurube Isshin out of regret.
Profile
Story
Akame Kanenaga was a practitioner of the Akame School, a branch of the Raiden Gokaden's Isshin Art. While the Isshin Art's Kaedehara Clan were master bladesmiths who forged blades in Futsu Masayoshi's style and the Niwa Clan mastered the art of clay tempering, the Akame School was known for creating blades meant for killing. Because of this, the authorities rescinded the Akame School's leadership over the Isshin Art only three generations after Akame Mitsunaga's skills won them that position. Likewise, Kanenaga - who lived several generations after Mitsunaga - was never able to become the head blacksmith.Kagotsurube Isshin
Later on, the Isshin Art was drawn into a scandal masterminded by Scaramouche, or Kunikuzushi. The Raiden Shogun bestowed them with the task of forging an important blade using an Ancient Forging Blueprint. Unbeknownst to them, however, Scaramouche tampered with the blueprint and as a result, the blacksmiths failed to produce a blade by the due date. Fearing punishment, many of them fledThe Palace, Dyed in Black and went under the Fatui's protection, entering exile in Snezhnaya. Kanenaga was one such blacksmith.Ere the End, a Glance Back
Although Kaedehara Yoshinori and the Kamisato Clan head at the time discovered the truth, after narrowly escaping death at Scaramouche's hands, they decided to cover up the incident and take the blame for their failure. While the Kamisato Clan was spared from punishment thanks to Yae Miko's intervention, neither the Kaedehara Clan nor the Isshin Art were as lucky. Yoshinori ended the family's blacksmithing business to protect his family and his son, Kazuha's grandfather, was never able to revive it. The Isshin Art, without any practitioners left, dwindled and lost its prestige.
Upon learning of this, Kanenaga was filled with remorse. He spent the remainder of his days creating a sword with which he hoped to restore the Kaedehara name and prove to the people of Inazuma that the Isshin Art was still trustworthy. This sword was the Kagotsurube Isshin, a sword with a consciousness and a desire to fulfill its creator's wishes; however, during its journey from Snezhnaya to Inazuma, the Tatarigami used to create it corrupted its consciousness and drove it into an obsession to prove its worth against the gods.</text>

<title>Unnamed Gladiator</title>
<text>The unnamed gladiator was a gladiator who lived in Mondstadt 1000 years ago as a slave belonging to Eberhart.
He is the subject of the artifact set Gladiator's Finale, and he wielded Deathmatch as his weapon.
Profile
The unnamed gladiator was a peerless warrior in the arena, and was strong enough that he nearly won his freedom. However, he was eventually defeated and slain by Vennessa, who was serving as a gladiator for the Lawrence Clan.Gladiator's FinaleAncient Investigation Journal: Part II
Story
For unknown reasons, the gladiator began fighting in the Thousand Winds Temple, which during the time of the Mondstadt Aristocracy was used as a gladiator arena. It is unclear when Eberhart came into ownership of him.
Descriptions of the gladiator's story are vague on whether he ever won his freedom; in Gladiator's Destiny, he is described as being "one battle away from being free." In Deathmatch, it is suggested that the gladiator won his final match for freedom but then willingly gave up his freedom to continue fighting for his and Eberhart's glory, later falling to Vennessa in the final match of his life. Alternatively, the two passages are two different scenarios for the same event, the first (in which he won) is imagined and the second is what actually happened.
Either which way, the gladiator was charmed by Eberhart's perceived care for him and lost sight of his original goal, his freedom, to fight for his and Eberhart's glory. In his final battle, he was eventually bested and slain by Vennessa, who pierced his heart with her sword. As the gladiator lay dying, he looked towards Eberhart's seat, hoping for a last bit of acknowledgement - only to find his master's seat abandoned and realizing Eberhart had only been using him this whole time.
Legacy
The gladiator is mentioned by Luther in Ancient Investigation Journal: Part II, where he fears he would suffer the gladiator's fate should the expedition to Dragonspine return empty-handed.</text>

<title>Yae Miko/Lore</title>
<text>The head shrine maiden in charge of Grand Narukami Shrine and a descendant of Kitsune lineage, Eternity's servant and friend, and the intimidating editor-in-chief of Yae Publishing House, a publisher of light novels...
Personality
Lady Guuji of the Grand Narukami Shrine also serves as the editor-in-chief of Yae Publishing House. Unimaginable intelligence and cunning are hidden under her beautiful appearance.
Miko has a mysterious demeanor around her whenever she assumes her duties as the Guuji of the Grand Narukami Shrine. When she assumes her duties as the boss of the Yae Publishing House, she is known to be very kind and enjoys reading books and stories,Kano Nana although she also shows an obsessive side in making profits at the same time. She has an enigmatic air around her, with her friends growing used to it. When speaking with outsiders or close friends, she shows a blunter and more cynical side to her. Miko does not mince words, even towards her friend and master Ei. Being a kitsune, Miko is fond of fried tofu. She despises pickled foods of all sorts.
As a kitsune and youkai, she's very mischievous, including in her roles as Guuji and owner of Yae Publishing House. She couples this mischievous streak with impressive skills of manipulation and reading people. As such her tricks and pranks are usually elaborate, long-winded affairs towards rather simple ends, which she does out of enjoyment and the fact that she enjoys watching people squirm. This has caused many people, such as Thoma and Gorou to become easily terrified upon seeing her. If not partaking in such affairs, she shows interest in those who get her attention.
She is one of Ei's only friends who survived the ravages of time. She tends to call the Shogun by her true name, Ei. Ei herself also calls Miko by her first name, signifying their closeness and friendship.
Despite her light-hearted, mischievous personality, she showed a more emotional side during the Hyakkiyakou, indicating that she does genuinely care for those in her life and has considered thousands of youkai from across Inazuma to be her friends. Though in typical fashion for her, she quickly turns the Traveler and Paimon's sympathy into opportunity to trick them into paying for an expensive dinner.

But if the kitsune watches humans, where will her destiny lead?
Character Stories
The head shrine maiden of the Grand Narukami Shrine, descendant of Hakushin's lineage, Eternity's servant and friend, and the intimidating editor-in-chief of Yae Publishing House, a publisher of light novels...Come to think of it, Yae Miko's nicknames are as myriad as her changeable moods.The number of people who have tried to "figure her out" for various reasons could fill the streets from the Tenryou Commission estate to Yae Publishing House if you were to line them all up, but to this day, very few indeed have succeeded.Not that Miko has ever intended to conceal anything, of course. Any capriciousness is but the result of doing as she wills and pleases. A riddle with no solution is no riddle at all, in any case!You just need to remember that she will always be none other than the wise and beautiful Yae Miko.
Yae Publishing House's editors once submitted a certain manuscript to the editor-in-chief.This work was well-written, clearly thought out, and the themes were romance with a side of comedy — a prime slice of the zeitgeist.Such a gem would surely require but a thin coat of polish and a few beautiful illustrations to sell well!But unexpectedly, Yae Miko did not seem pleased with this, instead heaving a deep sigh before calling for the various head editors.One of them asked hesitantly, "Lady Yae, I... Well, I did ask him to write on this topic, yes, but isn't this the hot genre of the day?"Faced with the editor's doubtful gaze, Miko gave her opinion forthrightly: that a book that should have been interesting yet was shackled at every turn by the topic was, simply put, "not free enough."Things like "top sellers," "genre fiction," these were naught but fads that would come and go every decade.Getting with the times was a shortcut, yes, but if a work had the quality that could surmount this tide, why go with the flow nonetheless?"Pass this message to this new author of ours: tell him that there's no need to bother about genre. He just needs to write his story and write it well."Upon hearing this, the author stopped writing for a time, as if suddenly having an epiphany. Several months later, a new manuscript was sent to Miko and her editors.The latter were stunned, and even Yae Miko, who cared little about taboos, furrowed her brows slightly — a rare sight indeed."Um... What do we do? This isn't good...""Exactly! I mean, there's 'not being concerned about genre, and then there's something like 'Shogun Almighty: Reborn as Raiden'... This is just too much!""Hmm? Genre? No, no, there's no problem with that — it's his pen name I'm worried about. It's too normal for a book like this.""Huh, so that was what you were concerned about... No, uh, never mind. As long as you're happy, Lady Yae."Not long after, the author of this book would take to the literary stage with the Yae Miko-approved (and overly long) pen name "Kadenokouji Kenzaburou."As to how the editor-in-chief got the idea to start a "Reborn as Guuji Yae" writing submission event, that would be a tale for another day.
If there was something inconvenient about being the Guuji, it is that she must attend every shrine ceremony, dressed up to the nines and in her proper place in the sanctuary.The fireworks paint the night skies as they blossom, and the sounds of human merriment fill the shrine, and yet she must sit within, a solemn smile on her face...Such tragedies are even more frightful to Miko than the possible wholesale disappearance of Fried Tofu from Teyvat.With the somewhat longer span of years that the Electro Archon's servants have, a hundred years pass in the blink of an eye. As the years fly by, boredom becomes the greatest foe.And if even she were, archon-forbid, one day to accept sitting quietly still, obstinate as deadwood, would the world now sorely lack for another clever person adept at discovering fun and grasping opportunity?As such, looking for fun things to do in every nook and cranny can only be the most reasonable and necessary course.And if she were to, say, utilize her authority as Guuji in making fun things happen — why, some things are unavoidable, are they not?On the day of the festival, Guuji Yae would nod in satisfaction as she received a delivery of fireworks from the Yashiro Commission — of Naganohara Fireworks Naganohara construction and specially-made to boot.That night's ceremony was, of course, performed with perfect respect to all etiquette and rites.The sight of the "Lady Guuji" kneeling gracefully the whole night through would be the object of awe for all the other shrine maidens.In the meantime, she would sit beneath the meteor shower of light adorning the skies, watching the festival-goers as they came and went.And the din of the fireworks covered the mumbling that came between teeth chewing on a candy apple."You know, when you asked me to become Guuji, you never mentioned that I'd only ever be able to sneak outside to watch the festivities from then on."
Pursuing fun and finding happiness is how Miko lives her everyday life.For someone who enjoys studying humanity like her, "perspectives" and "virtue" play distant second fiddles to "fun."Even a Sangonomiya Kokomi great shrine maiden of a different faith or an Gorou enemy general might pique her interest....That said, this appreciation can sometimes lead to some innocuous trouble.As opposed to those conscientious underlings or worshipful juniors, Miko's favorite person at the shrine is a shrine maiden named Kano Nana.Yes, that Kano Nana, the novel enthusiast (just like Miko) who constantly frets over Sayu.While laying about indoors, Miko would often see Sayu flash past the window, followed not long after by a hurried and angry Kano Nana.Like lightning and thunder they were, which caught Miko's attention, to the point where she would even sometimes give wrong directions just to let the ruckus go on for a little longer.There was another time when Sayu told Miko that the afternoon sun was the most pleasant after the latter had helped her steal some time for napping.Perhaps encouraged by these words, Miko would transform into an ordinary Inazuman lady on a wonderfully sunny afternoon, descend from the mountain and have a day out.The Aisa Bathhouse in the city, Hanamizaka's Kiminami Restaurant, Ogura Textiles and Kimonos by the streetside... she did not miss a single store, and every one was an enjoyable experience.And in the evening, she was at Bantan Sango Detective Agency to tell them of a missing animals case that she had heard about on the way."But you really must help, good detectives. I mean, one can barely stand to watch those owners cry their eyes out as it is..."Having done all this, the lady could not help but let slip a pleased smile.Taking part in Inazuma's daily life in such an identity really was fun.Well, except that part where Kujou Sara shot her a suspicious glance as they passed each other by.Right, and also, she probably owed the Aikawa Susumu boss of Aisa Bathhouse an apology — the Natlan outland-styled hot springs were indeed very good, but she might have accidentally shed some fox fur during the soak.
A long, long time ago, humanity did not need to use the phrase "a long, long time ago" to preface tales about youkai.The tengu dominated the skies, the oni swept across the battlefield, the tanuki were seen along small paths, and the kitsune walked amongst humans.Under the banner of Narukami, the incredible powers of the youkai host were used to help humans through an era of strife and poverty.Seeking refuge in the mountains, they built a city by the sea, and so began Inazuma.Amongst the youkai, the Hakushin Clan lineage of Hakushin Kitsune was the most revered, and it was this great line that left a great many tales amongst humans.Whenever the youkai gathered to feast and sup together, a little braggadocio about how their latest exploits had become legend anew was very much a given.Of course, considering the amount they would drink, most tales told afterward would diverge a little from the truth. But no one minded, asking only that the tale be interesting. As time passed, this became known as "hyakumonogatari daikai," or "the great meeting of a hundred tales."It was no uncommon sight to see Urakusai raise his cup and speak, holding all the other youkai spellbound with his story, drawing even smiles from Kitsune Saiguu, the organizer of the event.Instead it was Miko, who was then in the form of a young kitsune, who would perch on Kitsune Saiguu's shoulder and relentless peck at any loopholes in Urakusai's story.Urakusai, being a cool-headed and brilliant gentleman, would explain as he twirled his beard.But Miko could always find something new to nitpick, and so they would go, back and forth, until Lady Saiguu would smile and call both parties to a halt: the audience wanted to hear the next part, after all.After another three rounds of drink and several more rounds of stories, the company would be hard-pressed to even string a sentence together, let alone a story.And so the gathered youkai would dispense with the word-fencing and use their powers to take to the skies to see who could best cover the sky and moon with their powers.And thus it was said that "a hundred youkai shall parade upon a moonless night."Five hundred years on, that little kitsune has already become a mighty youkai in her own right.As for the youkai who drank with them in those days, they disappeared amidst war and history, and their remaining bloodlines grow thinner by the day.And thus did their great parade, the Hyakkiyakou, become something that happened "a long, long time ago."
The swords of Inazuma have always been famous the world over, and the best works of the Raiden Gokaden in particular are national treasures.However, only a short time ago, more than half of the five artisan lineages were cut off.A great number of powerful people were caught up in that conspiracy, and those responsible were all called to account and banished.Even the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan was implicated due to their failure in supervising their subordinates...But before the Shogun could give her final judgment, the Lady Guuji, who usually did not meddle in government affairs, suddenly interceded, rescuing the Kamisato Clan in their hour of peril.Thus, while they suffered a serious blow, they were spared from dismissal.In the years that followed, others would speculate greatly concerning the Guuji's actions.Some observed the close relations between the Yashiro Commission and the Grand Narukami Shrine, and guessed that she had intended to foster advocates loyal to her.And yet the shrine had always been an entity unto itself, and the Lady Guuji did not usually meddle in governance. Thus this action seemed a sacrifice greater than the reward — hardly a wise decision.Some others said that the Guuji suspected something to be wrong with the whole situation, and now that the list of those involved was so extensive, any major shakeup in the Yashiro Commission could destabilize Inazuma itself.This thought, too, seemed reasonable on face, yet did not stand up to scrutiny. After all, was not the rise and fall of great houses merely ordinary in the grand scheme of mortal affairs? And even if the Kamisato were to fall from grace, new leadership for the Yashiro Commission would emerge.Yet another story said that Miko engaged in secret talks with the Kamisato clan head just after the initial shockwaves had died down.But the wounded clan was like a candle in the wind at this point. What power could they have to change the situation?To this day, all these speculations have never amounted to anything, nor have any answers emerged concerning Miko's actions and motivations.But what none know is how Miko's words that day would become as engraved into the Kamisato Clan as their house's crest."That the Kamisato Clan has survived this incident is only due to the Shogun's mercy. Do not forget this in the days that follow."These words would serve as a seed of destiny, foreshadowing the Yashiro Commission's future position.In some other time, if a storm were to descend upon Inazuma, and even if they were to come into conflict with the other two commissions, the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan would remember the favor they were shown and abide the Shogun's path to Eternity.This was a move that the Guuji played with no regrets whatsoever.
The Fire-Soothing Festival Committee was once an organization chaired by the Tenryou Commission and managed by the Grand Narukami Shrine, whose remit was to pray for a lack of any fires in the coming year.In those days, Inazuman houses were mostly made of wood, and any carelessness while handling fire could lead to disaster.Thus, the Tenryou Commission was charged by the Shogun with setting up fire brigades to conduct rescues and damage control when fires did break out, and they also requested that the Grand Narukami Shrine set the Fire-Soothing Festival Committee up to comfort the frightened people.In later years, anti-fire precautions would become second nature and serious cases would no longer occur often, but still the annual festival would remain.The shrine maidens would dance elegantly, and the people would give generously... with the proceeds split forty-sixty between the Commission and the Shrine.When Yae Miko was faced with financial issues while attempting to start Yae Publishing House, she considered the various services that the shrine ran at the time before locking onto this ancient traditional committee."I mean, the busywork is solely done by the Grand Narukami Shrine, so why do we have to split the proceeds with the Tenryou Commission?""What's more, all that Mora's just going into Kujou Senior's pockets. It's not like the fire brigade has ever gotten a year-end bonus or anything."As such, after some preparation, the Fire-Soothing Festival of that year would be changed to no longer feature dancing shrine maidens but a grand, rollicking light novel submission contest.The organizing body for this competition and any subsequent publications, the "Yae Publishing House," would also "borrow" the Fire-Soothing Festival Committee's budget.As for the profits? Into the shrine's coffers they went."Well, we no longer have many fires, and yet our budget keeps increasing. Thus, this restructuring relieves the financial burden placed upon the people.""Also, the study of lore and the writing of literature and poetry is also a way of pleasing our Archon — surely you do not claim to know more of ritual and ceremony than I?"That was what Yae Miko said most solemnly to Kujou Takayuki when he came by unannounced.The Tenryou Commissioner was ultimately forced to leave the way he came, stormy-faced, along with his attendants.Little did any of them know that the moment they stepped out of the shrine, the somber Lady Miko would pluck a novel manuscript from the nearby offering box and continue annotating it.
"That was a contest of magic for the ages! The foe split the seas as they strode across the skies, heaven and earth changing hue as they approached!""Gohei in hand, the Lady Guuji was solemn as she strode up Mt. Yougou.""All around her the shrine maidens chanted their mantras as the clouds masked the sun, the thunder waiting within for the moment to strike!""...""The battle was a grinding, protracted affair. In time, even the Guuji began to falter, and the enemy seized that opening, lashing out with great force!""Just then, a bolt of lightning descended like a falling star before the Guuji — a glimmering Vision!""Grasping it in her hand, the revivified Guuji showed forth her power and...""Now wait just a minute! None of what you just said happened, right?""Hmm? Well, how about this then? It all started the day when I had a most vicious "Ramen Duel" down in Hanamizaka..."Oh, come on! Nobody's ever gotten a Vision from eating ramen!""But wouldn't that be interesting? I mean, these are the sorts of stories you like to hear, right?"Yae Miko gave a thin, enigmatic smile as she was faced with the traveler's curiosity."After all, would you believe me if I said that 'my Vision is purely ornamental, just for show,' little one? Hardly — not even if it were the truth."

<title>Aranara Language</title>
<text>The Aranara Language '(unofficial name)' is the language spoken by the Aranara of Sumeru. The Aranara often include words from this language while speaking. It also appears that there may be a script for this language written in multiple Aranara inscriptions, such as the text found on the Silapna's leaf, or the text written on multiple walls.
The language's lexicon appears to be based on Sanskrit. For example, the Aranara term for human or person, "Nara," likely comes from mini=1 sa=नर sa_rm=nara sa_tl=human, person. Similarly, the Aranara word for Spinocrocodile, "Apshvaana," is Sanskrit for "water dog" and derives from mini=1 sa=अप् sa_rm=ap sa_tl=water and mini=1 sa=श्वान sa_rm=śvāna sa_tl=dog.

<title>Xinyan/Lore</title>
<text>Rock 'n' roll is an avant-garde art in Liyue Harbor and Xinyan is the pioneer in this field.She rebels against ossified prejudices, using her music and passionate singing to awaken dazed souls fatigued by worldly matters.If you get the chance, do not miss out on her next performance!
Personality
Liyue's sole rock 'n' roll musician. She rebels against ossified prejudices using her music and passionate singing.
Xinyan is a fan of rock 'n' roll and returned to Liyue to spread it across the nation. Despite having difficulty in improving its reputation for many reasons, she is not discouraged and continues to play, appreciating all who come to her performances. She does not have any formal training for her music, having learned it herself on the go. As such, she is very supportive of others who show interest, even if they have no experience.
Having a fiery, hotheaded, and loud personality, she likes standing out in her own way, but many consider her to be weird and/or terrifying as a result. While aware of this, her attempts to make herself more presentable to them ends up in failure. Despite her rebellious attitude, however, she can keep her home surprisingly tidy.
Appearance
Ardent Soul
Xinyan uses the Medium Female Characters medium female model. She has dark skin, amber eyes, and shoulder-length dark brown hair with dark red streaks and some orange undersides.
Xinyan owns a white, brown, and red square Ruan (instrument) ruan with an axe-like bottom.
Official Introduction
Xinyan:Time to rock!
She's on fire!
Check it out! Follow the flame that engulfs Liyue's nightscape and listen to the most breathtaking rhythms while losing yourself in this magnificent performance-
In a revolt against Liyue's traditions, Xinyan uses music as her weapon and fire as her battle-cry, to light up the darkest of nights until it is as bright as day.
After this wild ride, when the dust of her dream-like rebellion settles, the only thing left on the moonlit streets is a few onlookers drunk with emotion, with a lingering aftertaste of her performance...
As well as the shouting Millelith trying to capture Xinyan, who was charged with "fire code violation."
Even though she had burned nothing but her impromptu stage, the young girl promptly retreated amidst the fiery blaze, waving to the audience on her way out. She took her instrument and rock 'n' roll with her, leaving only a riotous uproar in her wake.
For she does not wish to be pursued, just like in the song she just sang to her heart's content:
"An old lady asked me where I plan to stay. I said Yujing Terrace's flowers seem okay. When the Jade Chamber loses its shine, I'll go to Chihu Rock to climb, or maybe visit the dock where all the dogs like to flock.
Unless the Yaksha takes away my soul, towards the crowds I'll continue my crawl."
Character Stories
Rock 'n' roll originates in Fontaine and is just starting to find its feet in Liyue Harbor, where Xinyan is pioneering the art.Every night, she slings on her self-built instrument, steps onto her self-constructed stage, and plays her self-composed songs to a crowd of enthusiastic supporters.Her music reflects her personality: bold and defiant, loud and proud.She is no virtuoso, but this doesn't bother her dedicated fans one bit as they let loose and enjoy the show, singing their hearts out and shaking off the stress of the day.In the heat of the moment, the fire that leaps from Xinyan's Vision seems ready to turn night into day."She is a rare rock 'n' roll talent and a master performer who really knows how to create an atmosphere," said a review of one of her live shows in The Steambird.Living in Liyue is expensive, especially when you want to enjoy the finer things in life. But as Xinyan would say to those tied down by worldly worries:"If you know how to rock, then it's easier to roll."
Xinyan does not adhere to traditional performance norms at all. Anything can be used as her instrument.The pillars on-stage, the floorboards, the cheers and yells of the audience, and even the explosions and sparks created by her Vision are valid brushes with which she paints her performance.The impromptu stage often starts to burn somewhere after the halfway mark of the performance, till all that's left is a smoking pile of charcoal.After many warnings, the Millelith were finally forced to tighten their patrols and try to find ways to stop Xinyan from staging her performances.The subsequent battles of wits tended to turn out in Xinyan's favor - she was often able to find a place to perform, set up a stage with frightening speed, and begin a raucous night with her audience.The more reliable word on the street is that many patrolling Millelith were themselves infected by the "spirit of rock 'n' roll," becoming her Kun loyal fans in the process.Xinyan would get wind of the Millelith's latest patrol plans from these "friends of rock," and was thus able to avoid their eyes with ease.Eventually, tiring of the lack of results, and in the absence of any evidence that anyone was harmed during Xinyan's performances, the Millelith came to adopt a "one eye open, one eye shut" approach to her actions.
Xinyan is tall, has a sharp gaze, and always wears her stage costume in public to keep herself in the right mood for her music.In the eyes of bystanders, this makes her quite the imposing sight as she walks down the street, and many assume she means trouble.When she lines up to buy a snack, people in front of her in the queue will panic and move well out of her way.If she happens to lock eyes with a young child, even for a brief moment, they will run crying to their parents.Even when she has done nothing at all, Xinyan is often suspected of wrongdoing, purely because her fierce appearance makes her look like some sort of heinous villain in the eyes of some people.Xinyan didn't care all that much about how other people saw her, but she did think that it wasn't a good thing to scare others and make trouble for them, if she could at all help it. Thus, she constantly looked for ways to make a change.Every day when she woke up in the morning, she would look at herself in the mirror and massage her face with her fingers to stretch and relax her eyes a little.She would even practice smiling and study expressions - verbal and facial alike - of great elegance.After a significant amount of practice, she once came across a group of children bullying another child, and instinctually she went over to rescue the bullied child.She gave the kid what she thought was a friendly smile and a gentle pat on the head. To say that the upset child quietened down after this would not be incorrect...However, the reality of the matter was that the child was stood there frozen in fear as urine dribbled down their pants.As for the would-be bullies, they screamed and fled in panic."Run! Run! The angry lady's turned into a monster! Sh-She's gonna eat us all!""Hey!!! I ain't gonna eat y'all! ...And I ain't no monster, either!"But it was to no avail. The moment she raised her voice, all her hard work was undone.
Xinyan has one standard by which she judges all things: is it or isn't it "rock 'n' roll?"All that is just and upright - standing up for those who have been wronged, taking on challenges - is "rock 'n' roll," and all that is reprehensible - fearing the wicked, oppressing the kind, dirty tricks, scheming ways - is "not rock 'n' roll."Rock is the spirit of rebellion and resistance, yes, but patently immoral acts are nonetheless "not rock 'n' roll."Xinyan reserves the right to make these judgments, and whether these judgments are based on results or her mood, the difference between the things covered by these two opposing terms is clear.The only catch is that these standards sound odd in certain contexts.Due to her fierce appearance, Xinyan nearly has no friends, with Xiangling of Wanmin Restaurant being one of the few exceptions with whom she can speak most freely.Xinyan has a special reason for coming to Wanmin Restaurant - for musical inspiration.Whenever Xiangling is researching new recipes, others may run for the hills, but not Xinyan. She intentionally eats all the experimental products, and amid the taste bud explosion that results from the never-before-seen flavors, inspiration flows into her mind."Tell you what, Xiangling, that dish rocked!"Though Xinyan considers this to be the highest praise, Xiangling finds it a little hard to be happy about such ratings.
The eternal subject of rock 'n' roll is resistance.But the thing that Xinyan resists is not a concrete thing, but rather, the conceptual shackles of "prejudice."She was born into a poor family, and her parents placed great stock in her, giving her the best of what little they had in the hopes that she would be able to rise to "become a phoenix."Of course, this "phoenix" would have to be something that they would recognize.But things don't always turn out as planned. Xinyan grew to be taller than most girls, and her looks were far from anything that might be considered "cute." Nor was she any good at any of the feminine arts, whether it was cooking, chores, needlework.So, since her childhood was so deeply impacted by such "prejudices," Xinyan understands how terrifying they could be.Yet becoming a rock 'n' roll star has not caused her to give up on these other arts.This is not only because she hates losing, but because she feels that "giving up because you have no talent" is itself a prejudiced belief.Not long ago, a fan of Xinyan's named Yun Jin was invited to her place as a guest.But if Xinyan hadn't opened the door herself, Yun Jin would have thought that she had the wrong house.The house was spick and span, the windows were clean, and the home ornaments were hand-made and immaculately arranged.The cooktop was still moist, indicating that someone had been cooking not long before, and there was half-sewn cloth by the bedside that looked much like the decorations Xinyan wore during her performances.Why, this was practically the room of some refined lady of reputable upbringing, with nary any spirit of rock 'n' roll to be found!Xinyan was quite worried that this fan of hers would find the difference between their impression of "rock 'n' roll" and this reality too jarring.Unexpectedly, Yun Jin's support and fandom would only grow more intense after this.
The way Xinyan sees it, many adults fail to realize their potential because they are tied down by prejudice, giving in to fear and endless anxiety.They do not understand what life is about, or where they are going.She wrote these thoughts into her songs, but invited scorn from the very same adults. "What does this brat know?"Even so, Xinyan did not waver. After all, such mockery was born of prejudice towards her age.And if prejudice were something so easily overthrown, there would be no value in resisting it, would there?She believes that rock 'n' roll is like a seed. After every performance, some seeds might sprout within the hearts of those adults who listen.When they wake up the next day, perhaps they might receive some inspiration, or perhaps a change of mood will come over them...Even if it only changes their thinking a little bit... Perhaps they might find that the real-life troubles they are facing are nothing but a storm in a teacup.Of course, few people other than her audience and the "friends of rock" would credit this to rock 'n' roll.But people do nonetheless say this around the tables after tea."Well, having a girl who plays rock 'n' roll is pretty interesting, no?"
Xinyan's main instrument is a hand-made lyre of a very unique design. She based it off the rock 'n' roll instruments that were imported from Fontaine before adding additional modifications based on personal understanding.For example, she mounted a crescent-shaped axe-blade on the tail end of the instrument so it might serve as a weapon in a pinch.She also connected it to her Vision, allowing it to spew flames and sparks. Its internals can also spew flame, all the better for it to self-destruct if it falls into the wrong hands, preventing its misuse...The list of modifications goes on, and they are too numerous to count.This instrument is thus unique, and its sound profile is also special.-Sorry, what? What do you mean, "these modifications sound like they have nothing to do with music?"Sounds like you, too, need to attend one of her performances. You'll understand then.
Xinyan was someone who never fit in in Liyue Harbor, and she only found where she belonged when she encountered rock 'n' roll.But because she lived in a land that had no place for rock 'n' roll yet, she needed to be able to attract enough attention.She immersed herself in the world of music, looking for a way to move people's hearts. She broke many an instrument and played till calluses formed on both hands, but still, it was unsatisfactory."Who'd want to listen to this racket?"The rotten-tomato reviews she received were starting to get to her. She wondered if she should quit.Sitting on top of Mt. Tianheng, she looked down over Liyue Harbor. But though the lights lit the streets and alleys of the harbor, they could not light the flame of the spirit of rock 'n' roll.She considered leaving, to go someplace where rock 'n' roll was appreciated. But would this not be running away? Would it not be a betrayal of rock 'n' roll's spirit of resistance?No, she would not leave. She would become a "flame" that could light Liyue Harbor up.She started experimenting with the use of fire to move people, adding sparks and explosions to her music.But this was no mean feat for an ordinary person.Who knows how many times she must have burnt her fingers or blown her instrument up. But still, she continued to practice every single day on top of Mt. Tianheng.And perhaps it was that the gods themselves had great expectations of this new form of music that would soon grace the seven nations...But regardless, the boiling-hot Vision would be the final stroke of perfection.Xinyan dashed down the mountain and began her very first rock 'n' roll concert in Liyue Harbor.Thus did her musical journey begin, with showers of sparks and explosions keeping time.

<title>Blue-Eyed Spear Witch</title>
<text>The blue-eyed spear witch, real name possibly Josephine,The First Great Magic was a notable figure during Mondstadt's Late Aristocracy period about 1,000 years ago. While her name is currently unrevealed, she is described as a sorceress with sapphire-blue eyes who wielded Crescent Pike - a spear of her own design - and bore a noticeable scar from the criminal's brand placed on her by the Aristocracy.
Story
Her origin is currently unknown, but she "hunted the vile" with her spear and became acquainted with Parsifal, a former noble turned phantom thief. He gave her a sapphire gem pried from a silver cup that he stole as a token of his love for her, since the gem matched her eyes.Wine and Song However, the crest of the noble house he stole the gem from was inlaid in the gem, which pinned her as the thief. She was captured and her face was branded with a criminal's brand as punishment.Alley Hunter Her relationship with Parsifal became rather complicated after this point, as she blamed him for her injuries but still harbored feelings for him. According to the story in 'Heart's Desire: Sapphire', many years later, she traded the sapphire gem that caused her misfortune for the silver cup that used to hold the gem.Heart's Desire
According to one story, the witch was a servant in a noble house, which was how she was discovered with the gem and then punished by her master. However, this account has not been corroborated by other sources about her life, most of which do not address her past, and she was already hunting aristocrats with her pike by the time Parsifal gave her the gem. From this, it can be assumed she already learned magic and spearmanship by that point. Her combat prowess was such that she could visualize all of her opponents' fatal flaws and take advantage of it using Crescent Pike's sleek design.Crescent Pike
At some point, she took on Eberhart as a disciple and taught him her method of spearfighting. But when eventually she missed Parsifal greatly, Eberhart noticed the opportunity and killed her while she was distracted, perhaps to keep his prowess with the spear a secret.Favonius Lance
Legacy
Some tales about Parsifal and the blue-eyed witch gave them a happy ending, though the reality was far from it.
The Fontaine Fontainian playwright Coppelius wrote a play about Parsifal and the "lady of the sapphire," which Parsifal the Great and her sister Josephine derived their aliases from 500 years later.</text>

These are theoretical max sub-stat values that any artifact can have. This requires the artifact to have the max number of sub-stats possible at level 0, so that a roll is not "wasted" on a new sub-stat, with the sub-stat of interest also having the max possible initial value. To obtain the maximum theoretical value, the artifact must then only roll into the sub-stat of interest, while also rolling the max possible upgrade value.

Character Stories
Outcast, hunter of machines, wSeeker Seeker, Anointed, Savior... Aloy had many identities in her original world, and she was destined on account of her genetics to be the heroine who would heal it.Now, she has arrived in a new world, full of never-before-seen challenges, and once again, she throws herself gladly into the hunt.
Aloy was born an wOutcast outcast, deeply rejected and feared by wNora her tribe. She was raised in the rugged mountains near their tribal dwellings by the experienced wHunter Hunter, wRost Rost.He taught her how to hunt: to have cat-like form and deadly accuracy. And yet, he could not pass the most important thing onto her - the truth of her birth. Who were her parents? Why had she been cast out?Unfortunately, the reasons for this were known only to the very wHigh Matriarchs High Matriarchs of the tribe who had exiled her.
There was only one way to discover the identity of Aloy's parents - victory at the wProving Proving, the tribe's annual hunting contest, in which the victor would be free to ask for a reward.She would train hard all her life for that event, but when the moment of trial came, the ritual would end in wProving Massacre tragedy.Mysterious assassins slew the participating Hunters, and it was only through Rost's sacrifice that Aloy was able to escape.Later, Aloy would learn that she was the true target of the attack, for she had almost exactly the same face as an enigmatic, ancient woman.
Aloy knew that she had to find these killers to understand her origins.Her pursuit brought her into a wild and dangerous world far beyond her imagination, bringing strange and powerful tribes, mysterious ancient ruins, and terrifying enemies - whether human or machine - before her.In the end, the true enemy, wHADES HADES, appeared before her.

<title>Skirk</title>
<text>Yet, his "Foul Legacy Transformation Foul Legacy" was not originally his. Rather, it was taught to him by that solitary girl who dwelt in the darkest corners of the universe.
Skirk is the mysterious swordswoman who was Tartaglia's master during his time in the Abyss.The City of Rains and Remembrance
Profile
Skirk is the disciple of Surtalogi, and has spent much if not all of her time in the Abyss. She is said to live in another ancient world, the dark realm, or the darkest corners of the universe.Namecard: Childe: Foul Legacy In her realm, time flows differently from the known world; three months in her realm amount to three days in Teyvat.
While she acknowledges that living is a blessing, she notes that a person's death will turn their bonds into "curses", hence why she no longer wishes to return to the surface.
When Tartaglia fell into the Abyss at the age of fourteen, Skirk took him under her wing and taught him almost all of his abilities. When Tartaglia asked her why she decided to take him as an apprentice, she told him that it was because he had awakened "it" and still had traces of "it" on him, so she was teaching him combat skills because it would be useful in the future. Tartaglia speculates that the "it" she talked about might be related to the All-Devouring Narwhal narwhal he saw in his dream when he had just fallen into the Abyss. Tartaglia tried to search for her again for years, but couldn't find any trace of her or the place where he fell into the Abyss.
Although her affiliation with the Abyss Order is not attested, she at least knows how to survive in the Abyss and taught her methods to Tartaglia.
Though she regards him as her disciple, Skirk claims that she wasn't talkative with Tartaglia during the time she trained him because she 'has nothing to say to the weak'.  She speaks to those she considers as equals to avoid miscommunication; as someone "greater than humanity", there are many problems whenever she tried talking to humans due to what she refers to as 'difference in common sense'.
Lore
When Neuvillette and the Traveler descended into the Primordial Sea to confront the All-Devouring Narwhal, they were able to subdue it long enough for Skirk to appear with an unconscious Childe (who had fainted from fighting the narwhal for a prolonged time), converting the beast into a small orb before throwing both into the rift she came out of. She expressed exasperation at how her disciple and her "master's pet" started brawling each other during her "short private training session", and acknowledged both Neuvillette and the Traveler's strengths to defeat the narwhal without relying on "power from beyond this world", likely referring to the Abyss. She revealed her master's identity along with someone else known as Vedrfolnir before reminding them of the prophecy.The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur
After the Narwhal was far enough that it could no longer interfere with her, Skirk could properly "smell" Neuvillette's power; that of an Ancient Dragon Authority with a god's "curse", the Hydro Gnosis, mixed in, which she recognized as the "remains" of the third Descender and suggested that he discard it as it was an item that brought misfortune. He asked her about their identity and when they died, though she did not know. She did promise to find out and that she would send Tartaglia to convey her words to him when the time arose.Finale
Abilities and Powers
According to Tartaglia, Skirk is an exceptionally skilled and seasoned swordswoman and a strict teacher; while he is known as one of the most dangerous among the Eleven Fatui Harbingers and was explicitly recruited for his combat prowess, he states that she could easily beat him with one hand. He is hopeful that in their next encounter at his current power, he could force her to use both of them.
As an indication to her prowess, during 'Masquerade of the Guilty', she states she intended to fight the All-Devouring Narwhal in a "short private 'training' session", despite Childe battling the creature for days ultimately unable to take it down and Neuvillette needing his full Dragon Authority in order to separate it from the power from the Primordial Sea it accrued in order to then battle and defeat it.

<title>Sheer Cold</title>
<text>Subzero Climate
Sheer Cold is a gauge that appears in very cold areas, such as in Dragonspine's Subzero Climate and during certain challenges.
Overview
Similar to Stamina, Sheer Cold is shared between characters for each player. It appears as a gauge over the active character's HP bar. When the gauge is at least 70% full, the gauge pulses and beeps, and the player's peripheral vision is reduced. When the gauge is full, the active character  HP Loss loses HP.
Sheer Cold's accumulation and health loss from Sheer Cold may pause while the player is engaged in dialogue with an NPC or an object. They are not paused during Photo Mode, during which time passes normally.
Accumulation Rate
Conditions !! Modifier
Delicious Goulash || -50%
Normal Goulash || -40%
Suspicious Goulash || -30%

Depletion
Sources of Warmth
Sources of warmth are the primary method for depleting the Sheer Cold gauge. Standing near them provides a buff every 0.5s that lasts 1s and reduces the Sheer Cold gauge.
Subzero Climate
Sources of warmth in Subzero Climates reduce the Sheer Cold gauge at a rate of 5% per 0.2s (4 seconds to completely deplete a full gauge). Sources of warmth in Subzero Climates include:
2
* Campfires
* Torches
* Ruin Braziers
* Warming Seelie
* Warming Bottles
* Statues of The Seven
* Teleport Waypoints
* Warming platforms in Peak of Vindagnyr
* The Dragon's Core cave in Wyrmrest Valley
* The top of the Skyfrost Nail (the object floating in the sky, not the entire subarea)
* The Frostbearing Tree (once thawed)
Scarlet Quartz is not a source of warmth.
Narukami Island: Tenshukaku
The only sources of warmth during the Narukami Island: Tenshukaku Trounce Domain are Hearts of Flame. One is located at each corner of the room at the start of the fight. Standing near one reduces the Sheer Cold gauge at a rate of 4% per 0.2s (5 seconds to completely deplete a full gauge). Destroying one reduces the Sheer Cold gauge by 100% immediately, though the animation takes a few seconds to play.
Scarlet Quartz
Each Scarlet Quartz that is picked up reduces 5% of the Sheer Cold gauge.
Scarlet Quartz are only available in Dragonspine.
Leaving the Area
When players leave areas that have a Sheer Cold gauge, it reduces at a rate of 5% per second (20 seconds to completely deplete a full gauge).
HP Loss
HP Loss occurs while the Sheer Cold gauge is full. It is unaffected by the conditions that increase and decrease the Sheer Cold accumulation rate. The HP Loss only stops once the Sheer Cold gauge is no longer full.
Subzero Climate
The active character will lose HP at a rate of 1% Max HP + 150 HP per second.NGA:  (in Chinese)

<title>Reizenbou</title>
<text>Reizenbou ja=霊善坊Redhorn Stonethresher was the Great Tengu of the Yougou Tengu five hundred years ago, the mentor of the Yougou Three, and the mother of Teruyo. She was close with the Kitsune Saiguu and became the kitsune's bodyguard after being beaten in a race. Following her failure to protect the Kitsune Saiguu during the cataclysm, Reizenbou went on a self-imposed exile.
Reizenbou was the original wielder of Thundering Pulse before she gave it to Takamine the Mistsplitter as a result of their bet. The Empty Boat of a Thousand Gates was her final abode.
Profile
Reizenbou was rather rambunctious and enjoyed fighting.Shimenawa's Reminiscence She was also said to be impatient.Thundering Pulse
Story
At an unknown point after the Great Tengu Sasayuri died, Reizenbou became the chieftain of the Yougou Tengu. She was presumably close with Makoto and Ei, as she was bestowed with the bow Thundering Pulse.
At some point in time, Reizenbou and the Kitsune Saiguu had a race; while the Kitsune Saiguu won, she suspected that Reizenbou had allowed her win. Following the Kitsune Saiguu's victory, Reizenbou became her bodyguard.Hakushin Ring According to the Otogi King Otogi Kongou Lion King, the wielder of the Redhorn Stonethresher, Reizenbou was also familiar with him.
Before the cataclysm, Reizenbou served as a mentor for the Yougou Three, a group consisting of Asase Hibiki, Kamuna Harunosuke, and Mikoshi Nagamasa, who traveled to Mt. Yougou to learn the Tengu arts.The Narukami Trail Among the techniques she taught them was "true 'magic.'"Hamayumi LoreEight Locales Over Mountains and Seas (Quest) During their tutelage with Reizenbou, Asase and Kamuna also became familiar with the Kitsune Saiguu and the Grand Narukami Shrine.
Around the same time, Takamine the Mistsplitter became her servant in exchange for possession of Thundering Pulse as a result of their bet coming to a draw. She taught him Tengu archery, which was apparently a skill she did not teach the Yougou Three, seeing as Takamine later taught it to Asase as to not waste his archery skills.Storm Cage description
Reizenbou gave birth to a daughter, Teruyo, around the time she was mentoring the Yougou Three.
The Cataclysm
When the cataclysm 500 years ago struck, causing monsters corrupted with Abyssal powers to rampage across Teyvat, Reizenbou was among those who helped combat the monsters. At some point presumably during this time, she and the Kitsune Saiguu went to the Empty Boat of a Thousand Gates. While exploring the ruins under Araumi, Asase and Kamuna found traces of their presence.Interactable: Earth Kitsune Statue Araumi Earth Kitsune Statue (in front of the Empty Boat of a Thousand Gates) However, the Kitsune Saiguu eventually lost her life and disappeared. Out of rage at her own inability to prevent the fox envoy's sacrifice, Reizenbou went on a self-imposed exile in the Empty Boat of a Thousand Gates, leaving Teruyo behind and refusing to emerge before humanity ever again.Empty Boat of a Thousand GatesThe English translation of the phrase "and this would later become the cage in which they (Yougou Three), having despaired, spent the rest of their days." in the description of Empty Boat of a Thousand Gates has somewhat deviated from the original Chinese 后来成了此人灰心之后虚度余生的樊笼，沉入了海下. The phrase 此人 lit=this person is an archaic expression which is almost always used as a singular. Therefore, a more plausible interpretation would be "Thereafter, [this boat] became the house of seclusion (lit. bird cage) in which this person (Reizenbou), having despaired, spent the rest of of her days in vain and [the boat] finally sunk into the sea."

<title>Mikoshi Nagamasa</title>
<text>Mikoshi Nagamasa ja=御輿長正 ja_rm=Mikoshi Nagamasa was one of The Yougou Three in Inazuma who lived around the time of the cataclysm 500 years ago.
In his youth, he was adopted into the Mikoshi Clan by Mikoshi Chiyo and lived with her biological son Iwakura Michihiro (Mikoshi Michihiro). Nagamasa took great pride in his adoptive family, and after Chiyo went mad from abyssal corruption and turned her blade on Ei, he joined the Inazuma Shogunate to restore his family's honor.
After becoming an Inspector, Nagamasa took up bladesmithing at Tatarasuna. There, he forged a nagamaki that would come to be known as the Katsuragikiri Nagamasa (Katsuragi-Slashing Nagamasa) after he slew his yoriki, Katsuragi, with it.
Profile
...Nagamasa is harsh, but also knows right from wrong. But even so, he is not amenable to reason. His name indicates one obsessed with purity...
Story
Early life
At some point in Nagamasa's early life, he was fostered by the oni maiden Chiyo and grew up alongside her biological son, Michihiro.Katsuragikiri Nagamasa He appears to have lived in or around the Mt. Yougou area, later going to learn under the Yougou Tengu and becoming one of the Yougou Three alongside Asase Hibiki and Kamuna Harunosuke.The Narukami Trail Inagi Hotomi: About four to five hundred years, it was said that "The Yougou Three" Asase Hibiki, Kamuna Harunosuke, and Mikoshi Nagamasa once went to Mt. Yougou to learn under the Yougou Tengu. [...]Inagi Hotomi: Mikoshi Nagamasa returned to Inazuma City to serve the Shogunate.
After Chiyo was corrupted by the abyss and betrayed Ei during the fight against the dark forces of the cataclysm, Michihiro secluded himself in Konda Village out of shame while Nagamasa left to join the Shogunate and restore the Mikoshi name.Shimenawa's Reminiscence
As an Inspector
After becoming an inspector, Nagamasa went to Tatarasuna with his yoriki Katsuragi. There, he developed an interest in weaponsmithing, a pursuit that the rest of his group - consisting of Vice Armory Officer Miyazaki, Nozomu, and Kinjiro - believed had a beneficial effect on his temperament. With Katsuragi and Miyazaki's help, Nagamasa forged a nagamaki he named Daitatara Nagamasa ja=大たたら長正 ja_tl=Great Tatara Nagamasa.
Around the same time, Katsuragi found a puppet inside a hidden palace called Shakkei Pavilion - Ei's prototype puppet, the entity later known as Scaramouche.The Kabukimono's Finale He introduced the young man to Nagamasa, who in turn introduced him to the Armory Officer Niwa Hisahide and other workers at Tatarasuna. The puppet was accepted as one of their own, and was called "Kabukimono." It's likely that Nagamasa and Katsuragi were the only two who knew that Kabukimono was not the lost man from Nazuchi Beach, as they told others, and Nagamasa agreed to conceal his past because of Katsuragi's wish. He apologized to Kabukimono that he had to deal with him in this fashion.Plume of LuxuryIt's likely that the Plume of Luxury depicted the past events in the chronological order, which means Nagamasa apologizing to Kabukimono happened before the Tatarasuna Mystery.
On the completion of the Daitatara Nagamasa, Nozomu was so moved upon seeing the blade that he made a painting of it, while Katsuragi and Kabukimono performed a sword dance together.
Tatarasuna Mystery
The tragedy began when a mechanic from Fontaine calling himself "Escher" appeared, working with the Akame School Akame Clan - another clan of the Isshin Art 'sansaku' - to revolutionize the smelting process at Mikage Furnace. "Escher" was actually Il Dottore, dispatched on a mission by Pierro to cause chaos at Tatarasuna and lay the groundwork for a future endeavor. Taking an interest in the puppet, Dottore decided to make him the key player in his experiment at Tatarasuna and his smelting process, though highly effective, was actually releasing the Tatarigami inside Crystal Marrow into the environment. As workers grew sick and died from the curse's effects, people began to panic and Niwa implemented an information blackout to control the situation.The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call
Both Niwa and Nagamasa suspected Escher from the start, and likely held an investigation against him. However, Nagamasa took a more cautious approach, so he was too late and Escher had killed Niwa, and created a story that Niwa fled Tatarasuna instead.
The kabukimono returned from his expedition empty-handed, unaware that Ei had already retreated to the Plane of Euthymia while he was barred from visiting the Shogun. Viewing Yae Miko's promise to send aid as a sign that the Shogunate had turned their backs on them, the kabukimono returned only to discover that Niwa had gone missing. Dottore convinced him and the people of Tatarasuna that Niwa had abandoned them to their fates, and that their only hope lay in the kabukimono. Taking the device with him, the kabukimono managed to survive the ordeal of absorbing the filth. Afterwards, "Escher" bid him to open the device, where he found a withered heart - which Dottore claimed was from a subordinate of Niwa's whom Niwa had killed. The kabukimono, believing that Niwa had betrayed him and the people at Tatarasuna, was enraged and came to view this incident as the "second betrayal" that he experienced.The Gaze From a Certain God note=The "Divine" Will animated cutscene The Kabukimono left Tatarasuna, and the remain swordsmiths were unable to find him.
After Hisahide's "disappearance", the responsibility for what had happened fell to the second-in-command Nagamasa. Still vowing to clean his clan name, Nagamasa could not allow himself to die. Katsuragi was willing to face capital punishment in place of his master, and thus Nagamasa cleaved Katsuragi with the Daitatara Nagamasa before throwing the blade into the furnace. Nozomu disagreed with the order and reached into the furnace to retrieve the melted blade, later dying from his injuries. Kinjiro took the remains of the blade as well as Nozomu's painting and hid them in the Arsenal. From then on, both Nagamasa and his blade became known as Katsuragikiri Nagamasa ja=桂木斬長正 ja_tl=Katsuragi-Slashing Nagamasa.
Later life
According to Sawada, Nagamasa survived the ordeal and continued to live until his old age.As Though Morning Dew
Legacy
At some point in his life, Nagamasa authored the 'Anthology of Inazuman Blades', in which he named Hasui Geppaku Futsu and Haran Geppaku Futsu as the masterpieces of the Futsu School,Haran Geppaku Futsu one of the five bladesmithing traditions of the Raiden Gokaden.Calabash of Awakening
Revised History
During the events of The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call, Scaramouche learns the truth behind Niwa's death, taken from Dottore's own memories which Lesser Lord Kusanali previously connected to while she was verifying that he had eliminated his segments. After assuming from the Traveler's gesture that it was possible to change the past, Scaramouche decided to erase his own existence using the remaining divine power he had. In reality, it is not possible to change the past, instead only written history and people's memory - that are, people's perception - were tampered to erase his names. It appeared that to not make a hole in people's perception, the Irminsul replaced Scaramouche with various equivalent figures throughout history.
In Tatarasuna Mystery, the kabukimono was "replaced" by a mysterious "foreign mechanic", which seemed to be the combination of the kabukimono and the foreign mechanic Escher from the old history. Thus, Nagamasa did not meet the puppet, but otherwise his story remained the same.

<title>Osial</title>
<text>the story-exclusive battle involving Osial Turning Point
Osial, also called That Which Lies in the Deep, is an ancient god and sea monster that was defeated by Rex Lapis during the Archon War two thousand years ago. He was defeated at Guyun Stone Forest, where Rex Lapis pinned Osial to the ocean floor using his stone spears.Diary of Roald the Adventurer
Profile
At the height of his power, Osial was a powerful god during the Archon War who came to blows with Morax, the God of Geo. He was capable of creating tsunamis as tall as Liyue's mountains.Monolith Fragment Even after two thousand years of being sealed, Osial was powerful enough to withstand the attacks of three adepti and retaliate to destroy the replica Guizhong Ballistas. At some point in time, Osial "married" Beisht.
Appearance
After being reawakened by Childe, he takes the form of a five-headed hydra with a body made of water.
Story
History
Very little is known about Osial's history. Zhongli refers to their conflict as an "ancient grudge,"A Record of All Things
Zhongli: Osial... you and I were foes...
Zhongli: But our ancient grudge is but a bygone memory now. suggesting he and Osial had a long-standing enmity for reasons yet known. However, tales of Rex Lapis' victory over the sea monsters have become a much-beloved tale among the people of Liyue. The tale of the battle between Osial and Rex Lapis varies by person, but all Liyue people agree in that Rex Lapis wielded the sacred lance, Vortex Vanquisher, to pierce the rainbow of Osial and pinned him in the center of the deep sea.Vortex Vanquisher
Present
People who sleep at Guyun Stone Forest have reported reliving Osial's memories of his defeat at Rex Lapis' hands. It is unclear whether this phenomenon stems from Osial's powers, or if it stems from something else.
During "Heart of Glaze," Childe uses the Fatui-manufactured Sigils of Permission to unleash Osial, hoping to lure out the Geo Archon in order to steal his Gnosis. Despite being imprisoned for two thousand years, Osial's strength had not diminished, and he easily shattered the Guizhong Ballistas when the adepti tried to use them. However, the ancient god was defeated and resealed once more after Ningguang dropped the Jade Chamber on it. After defeating him, the Traveler gains a Monolith Fragment, which was part of the spear Morax used to seal it away.
During "A Herald Without Adherents," Dainsleif and the Traveler discover that the Abyss Order plans to use the Defiled Statue, insert the limbs of Osial and the core of the Weird Statue first Field Tiller to make a mechanized god to use to "topple the divine thrones of Celestia".
Beisht, Osial's "wife", became incensed at the Jade Chamber and plotted revenge on the people of Liyue. However, the plan failed as Ningguang had been warned of her presence by Beidou.Where the Heart Finds Rest

<title>Beidou/Lore</title>
<text>Captain of the Crux, with quite the reputation in Liyue.There are those who say she can split mountains and part the sea. Others say she draws lightning through her sword. Some say that even the mightiest of sea beasts are no match for her.For those not from Liyue, it may sound like a hearty joke, but those that have sailed with her will say-"No matter what sea beasts there may be, Beidou will be sure to split them all in two."
Personality
Captain of her crew, The Crux. She's quite an unbound and forthright woman.
Beidou is known as the Uncrowned Lord of the Ocean for her great strength - capable of slaying the leviathan Haishan without the aid of a Vision and earning her the respect of the Conqueror of Demons, Xiao - and for leading the Crux, an armed crew she established.
Beidou is well known across Liyue for her strength, her easy-going personality, and her good judgment of character. This makes her well-liked by many people, with children even looking up to her as an ideal role model. She treats her crew with respect, who in turn are completely loyal to her. While she does not like the Treasure Hoarders, Beidou honors a "first come, first serve" rule when it comes to collecting treasureGuili Plains Treasure Hunt unless specified otherwise. Even then, the criminals fear her and try to avoid incurring her wrath, knowing that she severely outmatches them. In turn, she gives opportunities for Treasure Hoarders to leave that lifestyle behind and start over.
The Liyue Qixing and Liyue Harbor's administrative side, however, see Beidou in a different light. She frequently violates the laws and has no problems with paying off the hefty fines the Tianquan Ningguang lays on her as punishment. While the two profess their antipathy to the other's way of life, they nevertheless remain allies when it comes to Liyue's greater good and seem to in fact have a close friendship, as they frequently play chess together.Bilibili: Petal-Lit Ships Fish For the Moon
Appearance
Rolling Waves
Beidou uses the Tall Female Characters tall female model. She has long, waist-length dark brown hair and fair skin. Her right eye is a deep ruby-colored hue melting into gold. Her left eye is covered by a red eyepatch.
Official Introduction
In all of Liyue Harbor, only Beidou dares to bet against Ningguang.
Character Stories
Beidou is the leader of The Crux - an armed crew based in Liyue Harbor.An armed crew means exactly what it sounds like: a crew of sailors armed to the teeth.Without getting into too many details, everything The Crux does is approved by the Qixing... more or less.Beidou is a trusted leader, so much so that her crew believes her capable of taming the storms and billows on the sea."It's Beidou! Even the mightiest of storms must bow its head to her might!"
Beidou is something of a cultural icon in Liyue.Though her fame does not quite reach the same lofty heights as that of the Liyue Qixing, one can be certain that every merchant in the city knows her name - and that of her crew, The Crux.Naturally, there are rumors abound regarding someone of her status. People love to tell epic tales of her earth-shattering (or rather, sea-splitting) feats. tales in which her abilities are exaggerated to almost superhuman levels.One rumor is that she can channel Electro energy with her sword. It is said that she once used it to cut Haishan a formidable sea monster from the depths of the ocean abyss in half with just one hit.Bystanders who overhear such tales generally dismiss them as drunken ramblings. But to any who has ever voyaged with Beidou themselves, these stories are no joke. In their view, if this world really were home to a giant sea monster from the ocean abyss... Beidou would certainly be capable of cutting it in half.In summary, Beidou's abilities are every bit as impressive as her reputation in business circles. So if you hear her lauded as the Uncrowned Lord of the Ocean - suffice to say that there is no smoke without fire.
Business people tend to put profit before their humanity. This is just accepted as the way of the world. At most, it makes for some light verbal sparring at the dinner table.But things are different in Liyue, where everyone is involved in business. They reject the notion entirely, claiming that Liyue Harbor is a special place where humanity is sacred.Foreign merchants will retort that the only thing special about Liyue is that "They've managed to commodify humanity, too!" To this, Liyue locals respond, "Then how do you explain The Crux?"With The Crux having made a name for itself over many years, its services are extremely expensive to charter. And yet, on one voyage when The Crux encountered a strong storm, Beidou noticed a small private boat nearby. Seeing the way it was tossed about by the waves, she ordered her crew to tow the boat to safety - despite the risk that her ship's keel might give way. What little food and water the fleet had left, Beidou shared with the rescued crew as she navigated her vessel onward through the raging storm.Finally, after several days, The Crux delivered the rescued boat to a safe mooring spot. Grateful to Beidou for saving their lives, the crew of the rescued boat became her loyal trade partners thereafter.After Liyue locals recount this story, they smile and insist, "When you have someone risking their life like that, you can be sure that it takes far more than commodification to explain their actions! Would you really dare to look Beidou in the eyes and talk about the commodification of humanity?"
Word has it that The Crux's boss behind the curtains is none other than the Qixing's Tianquan, Ningguang, herself.Both of the people involved deny this outright, though they do so for different reasons.As a member of the Qixing, Ningguang often needs someone else to do her dirty work for her. Of the many candidates available, she picked Beidou.Ningguang would emphasize that she picked Beidou, not The Crux. Ningguang's collaboration with The Crux is, therefore, purely incidental.Meanwhile, when Beidou hears the rumors about her dealings with Ningguang, she furiously insists that she collaborates with Ningguang on an equal footing: Beidou is her own boss and no one, not even Ningguang, is sitting in the background pulling the strings for her.Beidou is certainly unique among Ningguang's collaborators.She does not tread carefully or show reverence in the way that most of them do. In fact, one could even say Beidou is sometimes at odds with Ningguang.Ningguang's advisers worry constantly that Beidou is too unpredictable and too much of a maverick. But Ningguang simply smiles and dismisses their concerns."On the contrary, Beidou is the most reliable person in Liyue," she replies. "Just tell her the truth, as well as what's in it for her, and she'll come around in her own time."
Once, after disembarking from a long voyage, The Crux held its customary three-day celebratory banquet. The autumn was like any other before it - except for the new chef in town. This was Xiangling, the head chef-to-be of the Wanmin Restaurant.Looking to keep costs down, they lured Xiangling onboard after meeting her on the streets, by hook and by crook. When she saw Beidou, Xiangling was dismayed, and let Beidou know this in no uncertain terms: "If you want to have Yue-style seafood, then I can't agree to help you. I'll have you know that I intend to transcend Liyue's two warring culinary styles with my cooking..."Beidou merely smiled and gestured to the chest of gold coins beside her: "Just do what you're good at. We made quite a bit on our last run. How does a retainer of fifty thousand Mora sound?"Not one to shy away for a chance to prove the worth of her cooking, Xiangling took the job.When the day was done, Beidou was indeed won over by Xiangling's skill. She declared in front of her crew that Xiangling would soon be a renowned chef throughout Liyue. She also insisted that they refer to her as "Madam Xiangling."Having only begun to make her name, Xiangling admired Beidou for her generosity with money and her direct personality. Thereafter, Xiangling would sail with Beidou often, looking for new and exotic seafood ingredients. She found herself surprised by Beidou's vast knowledge of seafood and their culinary preparation, given how far she usually was from any kitchen.Of course, that didn't mean Xiangling would necessarily heed Beidou's advice on whether something was edible or not...but that is a story for another time.
Some say an object takes after its master.Though it may not be a suitable description, The Crux crew does indeed take after Beidou, exhibiting the same qualities.However, there are still secrets among the crew, spreading in places unnoticed by Beidou.Her Juza First Mate always takes new sailors out after their first safe return for drinks and fills them in on the details of an old story:In the past, the crew went on a journey to brave the unknown seas and found itself at death's door in a horrific storm.At that time, Beidou stood on the deck behind the wheel, singing a Liyue fishermen's song in the storm."...all the way until the waves died down and dawn broke on the far horizon..."The First Mate often ends the story with this final line and a look of longing on his face.As business grew and the crew expanded, more and more outrageously incredible details were added to the story, making the rookies worship Beidou like a goddess.
1. Facing a three-headed hydra of unrivaled girth, Beidou hurled forth her greatsword. Spinning in the air, it sliced clean through all three of the hydra's vertebrae, before returning to her waiting hand.2. Beidou has beaten Ningguang at chess. Twice. The important part is not so much that she did win Ningguang's money, but more that she dared to.3. Since the day she slew the sea monster Haishan, Beidou has never sung a fishermen's shanty ever again.4. Yes, Beidou knows shanties. But don't you dare ask her that to her face. I mean, you know how that hydra ended up, don't you...
Liyue and Inazuma share a common saying: "Its fins formed the ocean deep, its tail the mountains high." The fishermen learned this phrase while ashore long ago, and sang it over and over, spreading the tune far and wide till it became the much-loved song people know today. Whenever the mists gather over the sea's surface, one can hear the distant song of the fishermen hidden in the white shroud: "its fins formed the oceans deep, its tail the mountains high..."This was Beidou's childhood lullaby. The tale of Rex Lapis smiting the sea monsters had become legendary among the people of Liyue. As a child, Beidou loved tales like this, and in her dreams, she thought: One day, I want to see this big fish too.This day, however, she sang this song with a different emotion in her heart. Her entire crew sang along as they sailed.Haishan was in the waters with them - at once like a dragon and a fish, it was larger than any could have imagined in their worst nightmares, and mighty as a deity, raising waves dozens of meters high with ease.All who ply their trade on the high seas are destined to meet Haishan eventually. Beidou had longed to do so since she was nine, dreaming of slicing its head off in a single blow.Many times she had challenged the creature, and many times she had failed. But this day was different. This day she charged at Haishan with her best greatsword in hand, and crack sailors at her back.The battle would rage fiercely for four days. With cannons and harpoons, arrows and ropes the fleet would assail Haishan, while Beidou battled the thusly tied-down creature for ten hours, well into the night.Now, nighttime was when Haishan was in its element, and in their vigilance not a single member of the fleet dared sleep a wink. Beidou stood upon the prow, listening to the wind.One strike. Just one strike. That was all she needed. And so she waited, unmoving, in the freezing wind.Then, at the crack of dawn, having neither eaten nor drank throughout the night, Beidou heard a change in the sound of the waves.With one almighty strike that sounded as if it could have sliced the moon in two or ripped a mountain from the face of the world, she chopped the leviathan's head clean off!The sound of thunder filled the heavens, and a single bolt of purple lightning struck the ocean right in front of Beidou, even as she bathed in the blood of her nemesis.Thus descended a Vision to the slayer of the sea monster, its violet glow as stunning as lightning, and its immaculate, jeweled form a treasure more precious than dragon blood. A suitably divine gift for the hero who subdued Haishan.

<title>Fury</title>
<text>Fury or Rage is a mechanic that grants enemies new abilities after a gauge is filled up.
Enemies
Overview
Specters
Specters have a rage bar that fills based on the amount of damage inflicted from a single hit, this amount varying based on the Specter's level. As it fills, the specter becomes larger and angrier. When completely filled, they begin using new attacks and have their Final Burst attack enhanced.
DMG Taken (%Max HP)Fury Accumulated (%)18.75–31.252031.25–43.754043.75–56.257056.25+100
Riftwolves
Riftwolves have a rage bar that fills when they are struck with an elemental attack of their affinity - e.g., hitting a Rockfond Rifthound with Geo causes it to accumulate rage. If the bar is completely filled, the meter completely disappears and the Riftwolf enters its Devourer state. This can be easily seen with their elementally colored parts glowing brighter. In this state, the Riftwolf's attacks are enhanced but their elemental resistance of their affinity significantly drops.
Pyro Hypostasis
The Pyro Hypostasis has a rage bar that appears whenever it is extinguished. At periodic intervals during the fight, it will conjure three Flame Seeds to reaccumulate rage. Destroying these seeds lowers the amount of rage it can accumulate. If the rage bar fills, the Pyro Hypostasis returns into its ignited state.
Thunder Manifestation
The Thunder Manifestation has a rage bar present at all times during the fight. It possesses two simple attacks in its non-enraged state - thunder pylons and a burst attack. If the player steps within range of an active pylon, the manifestation slowly gains rage stacks, but these will dissipate if the player steps out of their radius. Getting hit by the burst attack will immediately fill the bar to full. The bar automatically fills to full if it reaches 75% of its health and has not been enraged yet.
The enrage state lasts permanently and a lock-on icon will appear on the player's characters as an indicator it is fully enraged. In this state, the Thunder Manifestation uses devastating attacks that deal rapid or massive damage (or a combination of both) if not dodged.
Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto
The boss fight with the Shogun involves a form of Fury named "Ominous Destiny." She gains Ominous Destiny over time and will gain more upon landing hits on player characters. If the meter becomes completely full, the Shogun will immediately enter her "Baleful Shadowlord" state, using a different set of attacks and gains an Electro shield that significantly reduces incoming damage.
Jadeplume Terrorshroom
The Jadeplume Terrorshrom has a rage bar present at all times during the fight. Hitting the Terrorshroom with an Electro attack will cause it to fill up by 2%, inflicting Quicken, Spread, or Aggravate will cause it to fill by 15%. When the bar fills, the Terrorshroom will perform one of three empowered attacks before collapsing with reduced resistances. Hitting the Terrorshroom with a Pyro attack will reduce the bar by 34%, and scorching it completely will cause it to attempt to summon several scorched Floating Dendro Fungus instead.
All-Devouring Narwhal
The boss fight against the All-Devouring Narwhal has a rage bar present, named "Hostility". It gains rage throughout the fight, whenever it takes damage and when the Eye of the Maelstrom is destroyed. When the rage bar is completely full, the Narwhal will devour the player, sending them into its belly to initiate the other half of the fight.

<title>Gunnhildr</title>
<text>Gunnhildr was a historical figure in Mondstadt and the namesake of the Gunnhildr Clan. She lived during Decarabian's reign and became a devotee of the wind elemental spirit that would eventually become Barbatos.Biography of Gunnhildr
Profile
While Gunnhildr was not the founder of her clan, her major contribution to the establishment of the current Mondstadt led her clan's descendants to name themselves after her. She was the daughter of the clan's leader, and along with the rest of her clan, left Decarabian's capital city after growing disillusioned with his rule. Bombarded by Andrius' brutal blizzards, Gunnhildr's prayers reached a certain elemental spirit. Her prayers, as well as her people's cry for help, gave it the power to create a shelter for them. From there, their faith continued to grow, empowering the spirit even more.According to the description for Sacrificial Sword, the Gunnhildr Clan also worshipped the God of Time. However, this aspect has been lost to history and is not recorded in the Biography of Gunnhildr, so it is uncertain when the practice began and ended.
After the spirit emerged victorious against Decarabian, rose to the position of Anemo Archon, and took on the name Barbatos, Gunnhildr decorated him with laurels and her clan became one of the foremost clans in the new Mondstadt.
Story
History
Gunnhildr was born to the leader of her clan, which had taken refuge in Decarabian's city. However, after growing disillusioned with the archon's aloof rule, she and her clan left the city's storm walls into the raging blizzards created by Andrius. Desperate to find some respite, she prayed earnestly, and those prayers were heard by a formless wind spirit. Her faith, as well as her people's cries for help, empowered the spirit and gave it the ability to create a small shelter for them. As the clan's faith grew, it empowered the spirit further, eventually giving Gunnhildr the power to protect.
After her father's death, Gunnhildr became the new clan leader as well as its first priestess. When the spirit - now known as the "Elf" - rose the flag of rebellion against Decarabian's reign alongside the Nameless Bard, Amos, and the Knight,Amos' BowShould You Be Trapped in a Windless Land (Quest) note=Cinematic Gunnhildr led her clan into battle against Decarabian. The rebels emerged victorious, and Gunnhildr crowned the spirit, now the Anemo Archon Barbatos, with laurels.
It can be assumed that Gunnhildr followed Barbatos to Cider Lake, where he established the current City of Mondstadt. Little is known about the rest of her life.
Legacy
Some time after Gunnhildr's death, the clan's descendants adopted her name as the clan's name to honor her.
In recent history, a descendant of the Gunnhildr Clan, Eckhard Gunnhildr, compiled the stories about Gunnhildr and the clan passed down through generations into the book Biography of Gunnhildr.

The Abyss, also known as the Void Realm, is a term which refers to four interconnected concepts:
# As the Void Realm, it is one of the three realms in the world of Teyvat, alongside the Human Realm and the Light Realm. While the Human Realm and Light Realms are capable of adjusting to accommodate each other's existences, the Void Realm is devastating to both.Piece of AerosideriteThree Realms Gateway Offering: The Eve

# Creatures that are endemic to the Abyss, such as Riftwolves.
Overview
The Abyss' "unworldly" power is diametrically opposed to the Light Realm's and can corrupt entities from the Human Realm, which are under Celestia's dominion. The Void Realm's dark currents are analogous to the Human Realm's Ley Lines and the Light Realm's elemental currents. Its darkness is extremely harmful towards elemental beings such as Vishaps and elemental dragons, although they are capable of repelling the darkness by harnessing the Light Realm's power.
The Abyss' darkness is described as the only kind of power that could dye Morax's stone pillars black. Venti, another Archon, was poisoned by Durin's abyss-laced blood when his attempt to connect with Dvalin was interrupted by the Traveler; only by visiting the Symbol of Mondstadt's Hero at Windrise could Venti expunge the abyssal poison from himself.Let the Wind Lead (Quest) The rest of Durin's blood was spilt in Dragonspine, where it crystallized into Crimson Agate, a substance capable of reviving the Frostbearing Tree, which died thousands of years ago after the Skyfrost Nail dropped from Celestia. Previous attempts to revive the tree failed, indicating that Durin's blood had special properties.Frostbearer Lore
Prolonged exposure to the Abyss can drastically change a person's personality or corrupt their entire being.Shaft of Remembrance He will eventually return to me, even if he were to be [...] turned into a fierce beast by that dark defilement... The Abyss appears to be attracted to - and draws in - those with great ambition, such as Gold and Tartaglia. Those who have personal ties to the Abyss have been known to gain an uncanny ability to wreak havoc and conflict.Breeze Amidst the Forest Tsumi believes that the Abyss Order finds the Void Realm's power addictive.
Denizens of the Abyss appear to use an Languages Enochian-Based Language Enochian-based language, based on the text that can be seen above Abyss Mages' heads when talking to Hilichurls and in their Adventurer Handbook description. Abyss monsters also have the ability to manipulate elemental energy without the use of Visions.
Time in the Abyss passes differently than it does in Teyvat; Tartaglia spent three months in there, but returned to a Teyvat that had only seen three days pass since his disappearance. When Takamine the Mistsplitter finally emerged from the Abyss, a long time had passed on Teyvat and Asase Hibiki was "no longer young."Thundering Pulse Lore It is unclear whether this time scale disparity is consistent, or if it can change depending on certain factors.
Denizens of the Abyss
The following monsters have been affiliated with the Abyss, although they have not necessarily been linked to the Abyss Order:
* The "beast of sin" which corrupted Chiyo.
* The Voice Inside the Head unknown "Sinner" which inspired Chlothar to form the Abyss Order.
Abyss Order
Abyss Order
The Abyss Order is an organization comprised mostly of non-human beings that harness both the elements and abyssal power, seeking to ruin Teyvat as retaliation for the cataclysm 500 years ago. Its members are former citizens of Khaenri'ah who were transformed into monsters through a yet unclear process. After being separated by the Unknown God, the Traveler's Sibling has also become the leader of the Abyss Order. The Abyss Order usually conscripts hilichurls to do their work.
Story
Ancient History
According to legend, before the Primordial One descended on the world, the elemental Light Realm and the abyssal Void Realm existed in diametric opposition to each other. The Primordial One created the Human Realm after defeating the Seven Sovereigns of the Light Realm, subjugating both nature and those of the Light Realm who hadn't escaped into the ocean.The Byakuyakoku CollectionOthers Light Realm
During the war between the Primordial One and the Second Who Came, the region of Enkanomiya fell into the ocean depths, where the forces of the Light Realm and the Void Realm already existed. With the addition of a Human Realm aspect, the Vishaps who had fled into the oceans grew hostile towards the stranded people and were only fended off through the creation of the Dainichi Mikoshi and later, the intervention of the god Orobashi. The people of Enkanomiya built the Towers of the Three Realms to regulate the powers of the Human Realm, Light Realm, and Void Realm. These towers, known as Kunado's Locus, Yachimatahiko's Locus, and Yachimatahime's Locus, were hidden using techniques only known by shrine maidens and the Vassals of Watatsumi.The Byakuyakoku CollectionThe Three Great Martial Trials
The Cataclysm
Five hundred years ago, during the cataclysm, the fall of Khaenri'ah's Eclipse Dynasty came at the hands of the gods. The "great sinner" Rhinedottir, also known as Gold, created an enormous amount of monsters containing abyssal power. These monsters proceeded to ravage Teyvat, causing widespread destruction.Chunk of Aerosiderite It is unclear whether the gods' attack on Khaenri'ah came before or after her actions, but the two events are inextricably linked. Following the destruction of Khaenri'ah, the pure-blooded inhabitants, seen as greater "sinners", were cursed with immortality, whereas the non-pure, or lesser "sinners", were instead cursed to become various monsters such as hilichurls and members of the Abyss Order.A Soul Set Apart
When the great beast Elynas (NPC) Elynas arrived in Fontaine, many abyssal sea creatures also emerged with it; Elynas' presence caused severe pollution to the nation's land and water. The Fontaine Armada was recalled to tackle the beast, during which they pursued Elynas over the course of 35 days while attracting all types of abyssal creatures in the process. Elynas had begun to bleed from unknown wounds and eventually died; through his remains and the power of the Abyss, the Breacher Primus species were created.
Present
When Tartaglia was fourteen, he ran away from home, and after falling into a deep hole, he found himself in the Abyss. There, he encountered a swordswoman, Skirk, who trained him, taught him to navigate the Abyss, and nurtured his ability to raise endless conflict no matter where he went.
When Scaramouche joined the Fatui and had his seal unlocked by Il Dottore, the Tsaritsa and Pierro would have him lead expeditions into the Abyss. Whatever he found there promoted him into the Sixth of the Fatui Harbinger, though following this promotion he was ordered to be on standby.
After the Traveler retrieves the Bloodbranch Coral so Sangonomiya Kokomi could perform the Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri, a ritual used to reverse Watatsumi Island's Holy Soil phenomenon. However, unexpectedly, the phenomenon failed to reverse and merely halted. Concerned, the Divine Priestess sent a team to investigate, only to discover that Enkanomiya was shrouded in a mysterious darkness. This darkness turned out to be the encroachment of the Void Realm, instigated by Enjou, who convinced the Bathysmal Vishaps to disrupt the Towers of the Three Realms in favor of the Void Realm. The vishaps, eager to overthrow human presence, complied, only to discover that they were even more susceptible to abyssal power. Tsumi went to the Watatsumi troops in the guise of a shrine maiden to aid in repelling the Void Realm, rescue the vishaps trapped under the Dainichi Mikoshi, and perhaps even destroy the tower. Although she succeeds in her former two goals, she ultimately finds herself unable to carry through with her last objective.Three Realms Gateway Offering: Aftermath</text>

<title>Barca Lawrence</title>
<text>Barca Lawrence was a historical figure who lived a thousand years ago, during the time of Vennessa's rebellion. He was the son of Lord Lawrence, the leader of the Lawrence Clan at the time. So far, he has only appeared in the Manga Prologue chapter.
Profile
Appearance
Story
Little is known about Barca beyond his arrogant and spoiled personality, which was the product of the Mondstadt Aristocracy aristocracy's descent into degeneracy. In the year Vennessa's rebellion occurred, he was about to claim the Harpastum ball in Ludi Harpastum for the fifth year in a row, after which he would take the Ludi Harpastum maiden for himself, against their wills. The fates of the previous four maidens are unknown. However, Venti had awoken to the cries of his people and to Vennessa's plight, and upon seeing how far his city has fallen, claims the ball for himself. After riling Barca up, he flees the scene and runs into Vennessa, who was buying medicine for her sister Lind.
Vennessa, who at the time belonged to another unidentified noble family, stood up to Barca for Venti's sake. Because of her reputation as an undefeated gladiator, Barca decides not to cross her and retreats. However, to enact his revenge, the Lawrence Clan purchases not only Vennessa but her entire clan as well, then forces Vennessa into a gladiator tournament to win their freedom. During this time, she defeats Eberhart's Unnamed Gladiator as one of her opponents.Gladiator's FinaleAncient Investigation Journal: Part II
Barca is last seen in the manga waking Vennessa up for her final battle, during which he informs her that she and her clan would be fighting Mondstadt's long-time nemesis, Ursa the Drake. In her hour of need, Venti reveals his true form as the Anemo Archon, Barbatos, and repels Ursa the Drake before telling Lord Lawrence to hand over the city to Vennessa as he had promised, leading to Vennessa's rebellion. Barca's ultimate fate is unknown, but he was presumably exiled with the rest of the Lawrence Clan afterwards and eventually died.</text>

Agnes is a mentioned character who lived in the Fortress of Meropide. She was the daughter of Earnshaw and mother of Lanoire.
Profile
Agnes left her home (Earnshaw's cottage) several years agoUpon a Flowery Field of Grass and ended up in the Fortress of Meropide.
Agnes worked with Lutz to send letters to Earnshaw. While at Meropide, Agnes was pregnant and gave birth to a daughter Lanoire. Agnes cherished Lanoire as the precious thing in her life, comparing her to "a little flower sprouting out of a crack in the rock, determined to grow even in the absence of sunlight or rain."Court of Fontaine Region Interactable: Letters to Earnshaw
As Lanoire did not have a proof of identity, Agnes had to start the process of sending Lanoire out of the Fortress. She said that she never received a reply to her letters from other family members.Game of the Rich
Agnes was plagued by a chronic illness and passed away in Meropide some time ago (which Earnshaw was unaware of). As a result, Lanoire became an orphan, and Estienne asked Cater to look after her. During the events of Unfinished Comedy, the Traveler and Estienne work together with Cater and Lanoire to help them escape to the surface and return Lanoire to her grandfather Earnshaw.
Agnes loved Earnshaw's Tasses Ragout, saying it was better than the food made in the Fortress. She was also the one who named the poodles Hero, Prince, and Princess. In fact it was due to her urging that Earnshaw agreed to get and raise these pets, and she enjoyed dressing them up.Hereafter... Earnshaw eventually did find out that Agnes passed away.

<title>Sumeru Akademiya</title>
<text>the faction the location The Akademiya
The Sumeru Akademiya is Sumeru's main governing body, as well as the most prestigious institute of learning in all of Teyvat, located in the middle of the tree trunk of Sumeru City. It is particularly renowned for its corpus in arcane arts and historical records.
Overview
The Akademiya accepts students from all over Teyvat and often sends traveling scholars, known as Driyosh, to other nations to gather material for research. It is unknown how long the Akademiya has existed, but it was already a prestigious institute by the time of the cataclysm 500 years ago.Witch's End Time According to Dainsleif, the Akademiya is a millennia-old institution, meaning it was founded 1000 years ago.YouTube:  The Akademiya also takes a role as a governing body of Sumeru handling much of the day-to-day affairs of Sumeru.
Virtues and Sins
The Akademiya has three virtues and six sins. The virtues are described in Sumeru's Talent Level-Up Material Sumeru Talent Level-Up Books, while the sins were deemed by the sages to be the sources of all crimes and banned to protect researchers from a careless pursuit of knowledge. They are the base of the Akademiya's rules, and the sages have been adding new rules and amendments ever since. Researching topics that are related to these sins will expose oneself to punishments, such as expulsion from the Akademiya or imprisonment.'Mechanical Life Forms Research Data' and 'Secret Text Interpretation Manual', All Returns to Silence
The virtues are as follows:
* Admonition Book Admonition: Admonition is the branches of the nation of wisdom. It comes from a pure heart and is to be paired with wise thinking affording humble words clarity and good deeds conferring real meaning upon what is said.
* Ingenuity Book Ingenuity: Ingenuity is the leaf-veins of the nation of wisdom. It springs forth from benevolent consideration, sets words of integrity on the right path and should be completed by harmonious conduct.
* Praxis Book Praxis: Praxes are the roots of the nation of wisdom. They stem from an unwavering will, validate words of honesty and bring forth the fruit of wisdom.
The sins are as follows:
* Interfering with human evolution,
* Tampering with life and death,
* Delving beyond the universe,
* Investigating the origin of words,
* Revering gods without acts of devotion, and
* Attempting the forbidden and fearing none.
Academics
While it boasts a university-like setting, the Akademiya admits students of all ages, and children can be enrolled in the Akademiya once they reach schooling age if they pass the entrance exams. Arina and Armin are two known current child students, with past child enrollees including Alhaitham, who enrolled at the age of seven before being homeschooled for a time, Sachin, who enrolled at the age of nine, and Kaveh, who enrolled in the Akademiya when he reached schooling age, although his age at the time of enrollment was not specified beyond him being "young". Uzayr, Shurayh, and Tanisha are also children who plan to take the Akademiya entrance exams after learning the fundamentals of architecture.Treasure and True Interest  Collei is expected to enroll into the Akademiya once she finishes up her studies.Wondrous Times
Although it is implied that there is a certain age at which prospective students should attempt the entrance exams and enroll in the Akademiya, doing so is not compulsory, as only those who pass the challenging entrance exams are admitted, making it unlikely that many students are actually able to study there. Those who are unable to attend school in the Akademiya rely on the Akasha System, independent studies, or training centers to acquire knowledge.
Students in the Akademiya commonly refer to each other as seniors and juniors; however, earning the title of senior is determined by academic progress rather than age. Tighnari, for example, is younger than Abattouy, but is referred to as his senior because Tighnari completed his studies and graduated from the Akademiya before Abattouy.Heart of the Machine
Nowadays, obtaining a degree from the Akademiya is a notoriously long and stressful process; Gregor a student from Mondstadt, fears that his parents will be old by the time he graduates and returns to Mondstadt.Cat's Tail Message Board Chosen by the Sage Hosseini states that it is not uncommon for people to graduate after the age of 30, and that he himself, being less than said age, has his hair turned near-gray from his research.Hosseini
Thesis defenses are by far the most difficult part of graduating; several of the Driyosh met in other nations express their anxiety over finding material for their theses and have changed their subjects due to extenuating circumstances or rejection from the review panel. Alrani downright fears the Akademiya, and mentions that Soraya - who is apparently among the top of her class - has "piles of rejected manuscripts."Endless Research It is implied there is a limit to how long a student can stay at the Akademiya without being able to graduate.Fertilizer... Salesperson? Hosseini mentions that if he were to become a Dastur, he could stay at the Akademiya longer instead of having to travel around Teyvat to conduct research.Hosseini
Lisa, who attended the Akademiya in her youth, managed to graduate in two years under "advanced study" and is considered to be their best student in 200 years. However, she is not fond of her alma mater after realizing the cost of "uninhibited erudition," having witnessed raving-mad scholars in Sumeru's forests and sages sitting in underutilized councils. She ultimately returned to Mondstadt and became a humble librarian, a decision that greatly baffles those who know how talented she is.Sayid
Research
On top of academics, Sumeru Akademiya conducts research into various subjects. It is typical for traveling scholars to gather material and conduct preliminary research for their supervisors' projects and areas of interest, while researchers are allowed to stay at the Akademiya to conduct their research.Facing Distant Echoes
After determining that no Electro Visions have been given out in the past year, scholars at the Akademiya theorized this phenomenon was related to the Electro Archon's will and in particular, the proclamation of the Vision Hunt Decree. This theory turns out to be incorrect when Raiden Ei reveals to the Traveler that she was unaware this phenomenon was occurring, and that Archons are not directly involved in the granting or denial of Visions. Due to "certain constraints," she could not say what actually caused the halt in Electro Visions.
While research at the Akademiya tends to lean towards study of ancient history, the arcane, elemental energy, and the fundamental bases of the world, it also bears research of the more scientific and practical variety. For example, Tsuyuko's education at Sumeru Akademiya has led her to believe that Watatsumi Island's Holy Soil phenomenon is not because Enkanomiya is trying to absorb the spirit of the island, which is the legendary explanation, but because seawater that touches the soil leaches its nutrients and washes them away; rather than suppress Enkanomiya, the Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri replenishes the soil's nutrients.The Moon-Bathed Deep (Quest) It is later revealed that Holy Soil is the result of the expansion of the Light Realm, whose elemental currents are strong in Enkanomiya, while the Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri reverses the phenomenon by awakening the Coral Butterfly Sangacorallia, creatures that can break down the Light Realm's powerful elemental energy into something more usable by the Human Realm which Teyvat is part of.Three Realms Gateway Offering: The Eve
Every year, the Akademiya chooses a recipient for the Pir Kavikavus Prize, an award given out to a young scholar under 40 years old, whose research submission is considered "groundbreaking" and "creative," and the submitter has "great potential." Past recipients of this prize have all gone on to win great renown in the Akademiya.Spike Self-Circulation Report: Abstract (Part 1)
Research into mechanical lifeforms is banned in the Akademiya, with students caught doing so running the risk of being expelled. It was initially tolerated and popular among those of Spantamad but when overzealous researchers began to perform unregulated vivisections and other cruel experiments on animals, it was immediately banned.Into the Hinterland
Academic Progression
A few different honorifics and titles have been mentioned in relation to a person's progress in their research and studies at Sumeru Akademiya.
* Driyosh, commonly called 'traveling scholars', are students who have been granted leave from Sumeru Akademiya to wander and learn as part of their research process. Passing one thesis through the review process is enough to graduate from the Akademiya, after which they may be considered formal researchers.
** There is another subset of students who are confined within the Akademiya and do not leave until they graduate or otherwise cut their education short.Henry Morton So far, no honorific has been ascribed to students of this type.
* Dastur are formal researchers who have passed two theses through the review process.Solitary Sea-Beast
* Herbad are researchers of high prestige who have immense knowledge and hold leadership positions.
* The Six Great Sages, also commonly referred to as just sages, are the scholars with the highest positions of power in the Akademiya.Araby They are chosen based on a set of criteria to serve as leaders of the Six Great Schools,A Toast to Victory one sage per Darshan. They are granted administrative power over the Akademiya and also sit on advisory councils. Some of their duties include assigning jobs and duties to researchers; for example, the role of the Grand Conservator.Homayun
* The Grand Sage is the absolute leader of the Akademiya. This role and title are cumulative with the one of Grand Sage, but little is currently known about what specific additional functions and powers this title implies. The Grand Sage's office is located above the House of Daena.
Governance
The Sumeru Akademiya manages much of the day-to-day affairs of Sumeru and is responsible for managing the Akasha System, a system which manages knowledge as a resource that anyone wearing an Akasha Terminal can access. The knowledge in the Akasha is compiled from the wisdom of the populace,The Continuation of the Sabzeruz Festival and the information a person receives is heavily regulated by the Akasha.Lost in Prosperity Yae Miko ponders whether this system was thought up by Lesser Lord Kusanali or by the sages;Wishes (Quest) however, it was revealed that the Akasha was the work of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.Dawn (Quest)
The Akasha is the manifestation of the God of Wisdom's power, but Lesser Lord Kusanali has little to no role in managing it. But as the First Akasha Terminal, she has always had her consciousness linked to the Akasha, giving her the ability to occupy the consciousness of anyone wearing an Akasha Terminal. However, she has only occupied the bionic puppet Katheryne's consciousness, out of respect for her people's free will.
It is revealed that the Akademiya sages are corrupt; following Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's death, the sages were disappointed with the newly born Lesser Lord Kusanali's lack of intelligence and thus sought to replace their god in an attempt to control knowledge and restore Irminsul. After Il Dottore returned to Sumeru to offer his assistance in making a new god, four of the six sages began harvesting divine knowledge from crazed scholars at a secret facility, using the Akasha to create a dream samsara to harvest energy and spreading misinformation about the King Deshret's revival. The Amurta sage Naphis and the Vahumana sage opposed the plan, only to be locked up by the other sages in response. The sages modified Scaramouche even further to create their new god.
The Akademiya under their rule was authoritarian, banning the transmission of information by non-Akademiya sourcesSulaykha and requiring plays to be approved by the Akademiya and to focus on Akademiya-approved themes,Zubayr Theater Billboard before ultimately prohibiting public art performances altogether.The Coming of the Sabzeruz Festival
The Akademiya also has a significant influence on how the rest of Sumeru thinks, as their radical views that deemed artistic expression to have no benefits quickly caused the rest of Sumeru to adopt the same viewpoint, resulting in citizens valuing scholarly accomplishments and practicality above all else, and leading to the marginalization of those involved in the arts. The Akademiya's demeaning of the arts spread to all forms of artistic expression, whether in painting, vendor performances at Port Ormos, dancing, or even architecture, due to the value placed on practicality over aesthetics. Even after Chapter III and the exile of the Sages, the Akademiya's influence still persists in some form in Sumeru, as discussing the arts is still considered the quickest way to kill a conversation.The Sixth Proposal
After Scaramouche was defeated by the Traveler and Kusanali, Azar and the other three sages that collaborated with him were removed from their posts, with Naphis and the Vahumana sage being released from their imprisonment. Four new sages are to be selected in a process personally overseen by Lesser Lord Kusanali. Alhaitham was offered the position of Grand Sage, but he refused. Nevertheless, Alhaitham became the Acting Grand Sage to manage the Akademiya's important affairs before the new sages take office. He would ultimately resign and return to being its Scribe, leaving the Akademiya without a clear leader for the time being.Pride and Prejudice
It is revealed in Kaveh's Hangout Event Act I - The Pendulum of Weal and Woe that training centers have opened up across Sumeru to prep citizens who are unable to enroll into the Akademiya for certain career paths, such as in architecture. However, some of these training centers, such as Alkami's, are scams that prey on citizens' desperation. The Akademiya is revealed to be unaware of these fraudulent training centers, and Kaveh speculates that they are unlikely to take action against them even if they were to find out because they have all of the necessary permits and certifications to stay in business.
Structure
The Six Darshans
Sumeru Akademiya is currently divided into Six Darshans, each of which has a specialty and a designated color for their uniform.Sitt The first Darshans were established at the same time as the Akademiya itself by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata under the name of Six Great Schools, each representing a type of wisdom are led by a Great Sage. Although additional Darshans separate from these Schools have been created throughout history, only the Six Great Schools have stood the test of time. Nowadays, the Six Darshans and the Six Great Schools are nearly synonymous.

<title>Tsurumi Island</title>
<text>Tsurumi Island ja=鶴 つる 観 み ja_rm=Tsurumi Shrouded in a dense Fog, Tsurumi Island was home to two ancient civilizations. One buried deep underground, before the time of the Thunderbird's reign, known as the Pre-Thunderbird Civilization. The other coming some time after, the civilization where a tribe worshipped Kanna Kapatcir (becoming known as the Thunderbird Civilization) and were subsequently wiped out by it. The land has since somewhat regrown and is now inhabited by hilichurls, riftwolves and automatons.
How to Access
Initially, only the southernmost peninsula and the easternmost two isles by Tsurumi Island's Statue of The Seven can be accessed freely. The rest of the island is covered with dense Fog that teleports away players who venture too far or for too long into it. Players must start the Through the Mists, which requires the completion of the Seirai Stormchasers, to lift the fog and explore the rest of the island.
Most of the fog will first be cleared upon walking through a gate as part of the first quest in 'Through the Mists', 'A Particularly Particular Author'. Players who venture into the fog without having walked through the gate as part of the quest will be teleported to Tsurumi Island's Statue of The Seven. Players who venture into the fog after walking through the gate will be teleported to the closest unlocked Teleport Waypoint located outside of any fog currently present. After finishing 'The Sun-Wheel and Mt. Kanna', all of Tsurumi Island's fog is permanently dispelled.
Teleport Waypoints inside foggy areas cannot be accessed on the map unless the player has cleared their respective fog area. This includes Teleport Waypoints that are inside areas with heavy visual fog but outside areas that fill up the fog gauge, such as the Teleport Waypoint closest to Tsurumi Island's Statue of The Seven. Portable Waypoints placed inside, however, can be accessed even after the fog has covered the island again the next day.

Three-Day Cycle
Tsurumi Island has varied chest and enemy spawns due to its time loop effect, which cycles every three days. Only a few spawns are unaffected by the loop. Notably, the Remarkable Chests found in the world (rather than being spawned by puzzles) change between days, requiring at least three different days spent exploring the island to unlock them all.
The island will not progress through the cycle without starting 'Through the Mists'. It may also be possible for certain quests or hidden exploration objectives to block chests or change the island's behavior.</text>

<title>Makhaira</title>
<text>Makhaira was a historical figure in the Great Red Sand, Sumeru who lived after King Deshret's death several thousand years ago. She was originally a resident of Tulaytullah and Xiphos' lover, who was sent to become the vassal king Badanah's concubine. She conspired with Badanah's son, Faramarz, to assassinate the tyrant. The resulting power vacuum led to a series of conflicts which eventually resulted in her death at Faramarz's hands.
She was the wielder of Makhaira Aquamarine.
Story
Makhaira's mother was a Jinni, from whom Makhaira learned her seven-fold sword dance.Makhaira Aquamarine She lived in Tulaytullah, which the lost prince Xiphos eventually became the protector of, and she became his lover. However, due to her beauty and her skill at sword-dancing, the rulers of Tulaytullah sold her as a concubine to the vassal king Badanah.Tulaytullah's RemembranceInteractable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, Primal Obelisk Khaj-Nisut Khaj-Nisut
After a time, however, both Makhaira and Faramarz, Badanah's son, agreed that Badanah's greed and self-indulgence would destroy the kingdom. The two drew up a plot to assassinate Badanah. Makhaira assassinated him with her sword dance, then they covered up his death by setting it up to be the result of Badanah entering a structurally unstable tower, which gave way to Badanah's weight and sent him plummeting to his doom.Lamp of the Lost Following the king's death, the tower was demolished and his hunting falcons were buried with him.
Desert Destabilization and Death
With Badanah dead, Faramarz was coronated as the new king. However, due to his relatively young age, Makhaira became the queen regent. She gathered their retainers and afterwards, it was decided that Faramarz would abdicate in favor of his uncle Balash, who was the master of Tulaytullah. One of his other uncles, Goraz, raised an army to restore Faramarz; while Balash's fate is left unclear, it is implied that Balash was killed in the uprising. Faramarz was restored as king with Goraz and Makhaira as co-regents, only for Goraz to later claim the throne for himself, take Makhaira as his queen, and exile Faramarz.
The people of Tulaytullah, angry over Balash's deposition, rebelled. Goraz's cause of death is unclear, but Makhaira handed his head to the rebellion to appease them, suggesting she may have assassinated him herself. Faramarz was restored to the throne for a third time, only for the people of Saleh to attempt to regain independence. Makhaira appeased them as well, only for another twelve of Faramarz's uncles to each make claims to the throne, instigating a protracted war. Faramarz emerged victorious and returned to power for a fourth and final time.
Despite being in love with Makhaira, Faramarz grew wary of Makhaira's penchant for aligning with whomever best suited her designs on the throne, and assassinated her using a viper's venom. However, the slave-warriors and the city dwellers conspired with each other and deposed Faramarz one last time, after which he was exiled to the forest.
Legacy
The Old Blind Poet, an unnamed general and poet who had once served Badanah, managed to survive the court intrigue that had occurred but was blinded at some point before he met Xiphos, who was apprenticed to him before he embarking on his trip to Tulaytullah.Key of Khaj-Nisut The Poet outlived many of the other historical figures of their time, and recounted their stories.Desert Pavilion ChronicleMakhaira Aquamarine's description suggests that the Old Blind Poet was blinded during the court intrigue that followed Badanah's assassination, sometime after which he became Xiphos' master. However, this does not mesh with the timeline given by Tulaytullah's Remembrance, which states that Xiphos and Makhaira were lovers before Makhaira was sent to become Badanah's concubine. Until further information is given, the wiki will assume that Tulaytullah's Remembrance is a more accurate depiction of history, and that the Old Blind Poet exited Badanah's service before his assassination for unknown reasons.

<title>Kitain Hideie</title>
<text>Kitain Hideie ja=喜多院秀家 ja_rm=Kitain Hideie, also known as the last Prefect of Yashiori,Back to Normal: The Story Hidden in the Bottle was a historical figure in Inazuma. He was the last member of the Kitain Clan, who was believed to have went missing or died during the expedition to fight in the cataclysm.Orobashi's Legacy: Part V In truth, he abandoned his mission and became a wandering fugitive for several decades before ultimately embarking on a long journey to find the Veluriyam Mirage, where he made a dying wish and entrusted the Shinrou Casket to Idyia in his last moments.Absolution-Seeker's TestamentReturning Curios
Profile
Kitain Hideie was the last descendant of the Kitain Clan. His mother was once a shrine maiden in Inazuma, and she gave him the Shinrou Casket that she brought from Mouun Shrine when he was summoned far abroad as the Prefect of Yashiori, hoping that it might alleviate the pain he would suffer in battle. At the time, Hideie did not believe that he would need to use it.
During the cataclysm 500 years ago, Hideie accompanied the Electro Archon Raiden Shogun to the northern desert of Sumeru - Khaenri'ah - on their journey to fight the disaster, carrying the Shinrou Casket with him. Hideie was traumatized by his time on that battlefield, especially after a friend sacrificed himself to save Hideie from Riftwolves. Hideie abandoned his men and the Kitain Cross Spear cross-shaped spear of the Kitain Clan and fled the battlefield, becoming a wandering fugitive. Afterwards, Hideie felt guilty for having brought shame and tarnished the reputation of his ancestors. He felt that he could no longer return to Yashiori Island after his disgraceful act. He frequently had nightmares about the horrific battlefield and the tragic fate of his friend, and blamed himself for betraying the trust of the Shogun. The illusions conjured by the Casket were his only source of comfort.
In his old age, Hideie decided to seek absolution to end his guilt. He learned about a Domain that could grant wishes, and became determined to return to the battlefield he had once abandoned, save his friend, and follow the Shogun to the very end. He traveled far through the desert and managed to enter the newly established Veluriyam Mirage. He begged Idyia to send him back to the past, not understanding that the Mirage could not actually do so. Idyia intended to explain this to him, but she noticed that the elderly Hideie was in severely poor health after his journey. As a result, she chose to use the Mirage to recreate the battlefield from Hideie's mind within the bottle, granting his final wish. Before Hideie passed away, he faced the battlefield with a smile on his face.</text>

<title>Arundolyn</title>
<text>Arundolyn was one of the previous Grand Masters of the Knights of Favonius. While he did not possess a Vision, he was naturally gifted in combat and honed his abilities through intense training.Favonius Greatsword
Story
Early life
Arundolyn was born from a long line of knights and formed a friendship with Rostam based on their shared dream of heroism. At one point he and Rostam snuck out at night into the wolves' forest, chasing boars with slingshots and fighting imaginary monsters with sticks. They followed a seelie and found treasure that had been buried for a thousand years, a small yellow flower. Another time they went into the forest acting out the battle between Vennessa and the champion knight of the Aristocracy, fighting each other with sticks and toy swords until Arundolyn won and they acted out the fall of the aristocracy.Brave Heart
As young men, they became fellow knights and Arundolyn used a greatsword modeled off the one wielded by Ravenwood, the Knight of Boreas.Ferrous Shadow
Later life
Arundolyn was given the lion title and became the Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius, while his friend Rostam gained the wolf title and supported him from the shadows as his assistant. The two of them defended their home and each other during those turbulent times.
Eventually the Kingdom of Khaenri'ah fell during the cataclysm, with black curses pouring forth and roots of disaster infesting the earth. Arundolyn led his knights on an expedition to fight the monsters that threatened Teyvat, spilling black ichor from their enemies with their swords. Unfortunately Rostam died during the expedition to Khaenri'ah, leaving Arundolyn inconsolable, and he gave up both his title of Grand Master and his weapons.
He returned to his childhood home and looked through the belongings from his first adventures, finding the yellow flower as the only thing in his life that was unchanged since his childhood. It is unclear how he spent the rest of his life or how he died.
Legacy
His particular style of swordsmanship died out due to it requiring great strength to wield both a greatsword and longsword at once.</text>

<title>Marfisa</title>
<text>Marfisa was a Champion Duelist who lived over 500 years ago. She once dueled against Parsifal the Great,Moment of Judgment or Josephine pretending to be Parsifal.The First Great Magic In the end, she was dissolved and her consciousness was absorbed by the Master while she was tracking Emanuel Guillotin.Rightful Reward
Profile
Marfisa was once a legendary Champion Duelist. Her origins are currently unknown. She held her own unique perspective on righteousness and justice and was exceptionally dedicated to her beliefs, stating that "Crimes must be publicly punished, and lies must be publicly exposed. That is how the world ought to operate, and how righteousness should be."
Parsifal or Josephine may be important to Marfisa, as they both originate from the same location.
In her youth, she fought with a swordsman from the Marechaussee Phantom, Emanuel Guillotin. Marfisa was defeated by Emmanuel's cunning tactics, forcing her to acknowledge the inferiority of her spearsmanship. As such, Marfisa began treating Emanuel as her fated opponent.
During the Siege of Poisson, Parsifal the Great (or possibly her younger sister Josephine using the alias) was captured. Parsifal, who had a past connection to Marfisa, requested trial by combat before the court. She presumably died in the duel against Marfisa.
Marfisa once thought to seek out Emanuel once again, and give it her all in a final duel. However, she learned that he had long retired after the Siege of Poisson; he now hid his wounded face with a Veteran's Visage mask, had lost the frivolous, provocative voice he once possessed, and had become an alcoholic. Marfisa believed Emanuel had betrayed his past life, but she resolved to personally discover the truth and hunt down Emanuel.
She eventually found the mask left behind by the dissolved Emanuel, and her quest for revenge seemed to be rewarded. However, she was unexpectedly met by the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, the organization Emanuel had been investigating. In the end, she was dissolved by the leader of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, known as the Narzissenkreuz, who absorbed Marfisa's consciousness and acquired her mastery of "spear technique".Rightful Reward note=Chinese version 「放心好了。你的枪术，会派上用场的。」 tl="Don't worry.

<title>The Encroaching Dark</title>
<text>The Encroaching Dark is a climate that appeared in the Three Realms Gateway Offering version of Enkanomiya.
Overview
When the Corrosion Resistance of the event gadget Bokuso Box is lower than the area's Corrosion Intensity, the player's party will accumulate Corrosion, which debuffs the active character. (This is different from the Corrosion game mechanic.)
Corrosion Index
The amount of Corrosion accumulated is termed Corrosion Index. The current Corrosion Index is displayed on the Special Environment icon for The Encroaching Dark next to the minimap. The icon will also turn from white to purple as the Corrosion Index rises and will pulse when the Corrosion Index is maxed.
The Corrosion Index starts at 0 and can reach a maximum of 100. When the Corrosion Index reaches 70, the warning "Current pyro Corrosion Index is too high. Return to the statue to pyro Recuperate and clear Corrosion" is displayed. In addition, the edges of the player's view will darken, similar to the Out of Bounds effect, but players can continue to explore the area. The edges will continue to be dark even if the player returns to areas where Corrosion will not accumulate and will only be cleared when the player recuperates at the Statue of the Vassals.
When the Corrosion Index reaches 70, 80, 90, and 100, or when the active character is switched or otherwise appears (such as after traveling via a Phase Gate) when the Corrosion Index is at least 70, a special sound effect will play.
Accumulation Rate
Upon entering an area where the Bokuso Box cannot prevent Corrosion, the difference between the Bokuso Box's Corrosion Resistance and the area's Corrosion Intensity is immediately added to the Corrosion that the player already accumulated naturally over time. The amount that was added may be cleared upon Fallen Character Out of Bounds and Drowning falling into the depths of the map or death.
The larger the difference between the area's Corrosion Intensity and the Bokuso Box's Corrosion Resistance, the quicker the Corrosion Index increases, and the quicker the Bokuso Box energy decreases. The accumulation rate's formula is unknown, but it is not linear: The difference between the area's Corrosion Intensity and the Bokuso Box's Corrosion Resistance affects the Corrosion Index accumulation and the Bokuso Box energy depletion rates such that slightly decreasing the difference results in nearly no change if the difference is still too high and massive change if the difference is already low, similar to exponential functions.
For player convenience, although the accumulation rate likely uses a single continuous formula and not a piecewise function, the difference between the current area's Corrosion Intensity and the Bokuso Box's Corrosion Resistance is categorized in one of three ways if Corrosion can accumulate:
Description !! Difference Range !! Rate of Corrosion !! Rate of Energy Depletion
The Encroaching Dark: LowThe Bokuso Box's energy will drain slowly || 1 to at least 15  || 1 per 20 to 120 seconds  || 1 per 53 to 240 seconds
The Encroaching Dark: MidThe Bokuso Box's energy will drain at a moderate pace || No more than 28 to no less than 30  || 1 per 6 seconds  || 1 per 2.3 seconds
The Encroaching Dark: HighThe Bokuso Box's energy will drain quickly || 43+  || 1 per 0.9 to 2.9 seconds  || 1 to 7 per second
Upgrading the Bokuso Box increases its Corrosion Resistance, thus lessening the rates of Corrosion accumulation and Bokuso Box energy depletion. A sufficiently high Corrosion Resistance will prevent Corrosion accumulation entirely.
Debuff
A higher Corrosion Index weakens the character, with every 10 Corrosion Index lowering all RES and damage dealt by approximately 8% and an extra 8% penalty at 100 Corrosion Index as follows, where X = ceiling(Corrosion Index / 10) and Y = floor(Corrosion Index / 100) / 10:
* Decrease Physical RES and all Elemental RES by (8 * X * (1+Y))%
* Decrease damage dealt by (8 * X * (1+Y))%
Although these debuffs are applied at any Corrosion Index higher than 0,  the downward arrows that indicate a debuff on the active character only appear when the Corrosion Index is 70 or higher.
Depletion
All accumulated Corrosion can be cleared by recuperating at the Statue of the Vassals.
In certain cases, accumulated Corrosion can be partially cleared upon Fallen Character Out of Bounds and Drowning falling into the depths of the map or death.
Description
The Encroaching Dark...
* help Current Corrosion Index: X
* When the Bokuso Box's Corrosion Resistance is lower than an area's Corrosion Intensity, your party will be exposed to Corrosion - which will accumulate over time and drain the energy of your Bokuso Box. The bigger the gap, the quicker Corrosion builds up and the energy depletes. Choose the help Recuperate option at the statue to clear the accumulated Corrosion.
* Higher Corrosion Index decreases characters' Physical and All Elemental RES and also lowers the DMG they deal.</text>

<title>Han Family</title>
<text>The Han Family was a notable family in Liyue that traces its roots back to the establishment of Liyue Harbor. Its first members were part of the Millelith and, alongside the Xing family, developed the Lithic Series weapons.Lithic Blade Description
Five hundred years ago, the Han Family still continued making weapons and had their own forge. It is currently unknown if there are any descendants in the present day, but it is likely one of their descendants owns the Blackcliff Forge.
History
Archon War
When Liyue Harbor was being built, a member of the Han family and Xing family were the first two to carve swords out of stone, carving Lithic Blades out of the same bedrock Liyue Harbor was built on.Lithic Blade These weapons were then used by the ancient Millelith, of which this Han ancestor was a member.
Post-Cataclysm
The head of the Han family was Han Wu. When the monster threat was resolved, a martial arts renaissance began, which caused a lot of demand for weaponry that manufacturers could not keep up with. To solve the issue, Yun Hui, the head of the Yun family at the time, approached Han Wu in order to revolutionize their craft. The two conducted extensive research, and Han Wu used that research to draw up the Prototype Series prototype designs.Prototype Rancour Initially this only included a Prototype Rancour longsword, a Prototype Archaic greatsword and a Prototype Starglitter polearm. When the polearm was made, Yun Hui dedicated it to his father because the tip glowed like a star. Prototype Starglitter Yun Hui personally requested a bow be added to the prototypes, so Han Wu gathered a large variety of resources to experiment with and made a Prototype Crescent bow for the series.Prototype Crescent Some time afterward the thaumaturges came to Yun Hui asking him to make a new kind of catalyst. He agreed and alongside Han Wu used the Cor Purum they gave him to make a catalyst and named it "Prototype Amber," adding it to the prototype series.Prototype Amber
However, Han Wu's son Han Ce had no intention of carrying the family tradition and became a wanderer who journeyed across Liyue, leading to a rift between him and his father. During this time, Han Wu realized the ores available to him were limiting his weapons' potential, so Han Wu used one of Yun Hui's connections to take a mining crew into the Chasm in search of more crystallized blackcliff for his designs. In his hand was a prototype of his latest weapon known as Blackcliff Longsword. However, a cave-in trapped them inside, completely cutting them off from the outside world. As his men fell to madness and despair, Wu used his prototype sword to carve their way out of the mine. When his sword hit rock, it released a deafening roar — something that none of the survivors ever spoke about. Wu came out of the incident greatly changed. Upon hearing about it, Ce hurried home and found that his fiery-tempered father had drastically mellowed, and for the first time, the two were able to reconcile.
Several years later, a crisis fell upon Liyue: the Chasm was rocked by great earthquakes, forcing it to be shut down. Upon hearing about this, Han Wu was wracked with guilt, believing that he had disturbed the dragon that lay underneath it during the cave-in. He dragged himself out of his sickbed to forge Blackcliff Slasher, ordering Han Ce to build a shrine in the cave and place the sword in it to ward off evil and rebuke the dragon. The crisis also affected the Yun Family, and the current head, Yun Huang, was struck with fear that the family business would end with her. Han Ce crafted the Blackcliff Warbow based on his father's design, and presented it to Yun Huang, knowing Huang specialized in archery. After testing it, she realized it was the breakthrough she had prayed for.
A few years afterwards, Han Wu passed away peacefully in his sleep. That very same day, the shrine emerged from the cave, the sword glowing as if grieving the death of its creator. Han Ce went to the shrine that night and retrieved the sword. A Tianshu of the Qixing, implied to be Han Wu's old partner Yun Hui, personally engraved an inscription upon the blade.Blackcliff Slasher Lore He also found his father's weapon designs for the prototypes and with them, created the Blackcliff Pole based on the mysterious Aerosiderite that felled in front of his home, which Han Ce depicted as the gift from Heaven. He decided afterwards to continue the family business.Blackcliff Pole Lore As the head of the family, Han Ce once again cooperated with Yun Huang to craft Blackcliff Agate, just as their fathers had cooperated to craft Prototype Amber.Blackcliff Agate Lore

<title>Greater Lord Rukkhadevata</title>
<text>Greater Lord Rukkhadevata was the original Dendro Archon of Sumeru,Further Observation the avatar of Irminsul,Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies and the predecessor to the current Dendro Archon, Lesser Lord Kusanali. Like her successor, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata held the title of God of Wisdom.YouTube:  (Timestamp: 8m 23s)
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata was once one of "The Three Eternal Companion-Gods" who co-reigned in Sumeru, alongside King Deshret and Nabu Malikata.Dune-Entombed Fecundity: Part II When the other two gods propagated a plan to turn against Celestia, Rukkhadevata chose not to stay by their sides and instead established her own territory by nurturing a rainforest with the Varuna Contraption. The Aranara, her creations and familiars, called her Queen Aranyani.Arakarman
During the cataclysm five hundred years ago, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata was one of the casualties of the conflict.Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's conclusion that she died 500 years ago is supported by Viridescent Venerer's Determination's claim about the death of the God of the Woods during "the disaster," which In Remembrance of Viridescent Fields specifies as the cataclysm. Before her death, she created the Akasha System to purge forbidden knowledge from Irminsul and created her next incarnation, Lesser Lord Kusanali, who then ascended as the current Dendro Archon and God of Wisdom.Solitary FragranceWishes (Quest)
At the end of the Sumeru Archon Quests, Rukkhadevata sacrifices herself by having Lesser Lord Kusanali remove all memories of her existence from Teyvat. The only known person to still clearly remember her is the Traveler, which they believe is because they are not from Teyvat, and thus their memories are not under Irminsul's jurisdiction.

Nabu Malikata, a Seelie survivor, heard about Rukkhadevata's wisdom and was impressed by the princess' answers to her riddles. The two forged an alliance which also included King Deshret,Scroll of Streaming Song who was co-ruling Ay-Khanoum with Nabu MalikataOasis Garden's Mourning and chose to "share" his throne with them during the Archon War, leading the three to be known as "The Three Eternal Companion-Gods"; the three had their own views on "wisdom" and often debated their ideas together.Deepwood Memories For a period of time, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata co-reigned with them in the desert, with each focusing on a different aspect of their civilization, and this era was remembered by their subjects as one of peace and ease.Honeyed Final Feast To this day, a chair with Rukkhadevata's name inscribed on it can be found in the Orchard of Pairidaeza.
At some point, Nabu Malikata foresaw the coming of the cataclysm and realized that humanity might not survive on its own, so she informed Rukkhadevata of the future she saw and entrusted the other goddess with "a part of herself," a Khvarena of flowers.Vourukasha's Glow For her own part, the Goddess of Flowers understood and embraced her own fate - to die leading King Deshret on the path of understanding forbidden knowledge, despite knowing that his endeavors were futile, in hopes of one day overturning the Heavenly Principles.Flower of Paradise Lost Hearing of their plans and finding them unacceptable, Rukkhadevata broke ties with both of them and returned to the forest to pursue her own ideas of wisdom.

Revitalization of the Forest
After her falling out with King Deshret and Nabu Malikata, Rukkhadevata created the Varuna Contraption in a section of the desert,{{Ref/Domain|The Coordinates of Sun and Rain|note=Chinese version|依照传说，司草木的女神在沙漠的一角唤出能召来甘霖的精灵，名之曰「法留纳」亦即「水天」。 tl=According to legend, the goddess who controlled plants summoned, in a part of the desert, a spirit of sweet rains, whose name was Varuna, or 'Water-Sky.' after which the moonlight's reflection off the water created the image of a labyrinth.

With the help of her followers, who would go on to establish the Amurta Darshan of Sumeru Akademiya, Rukkhadevata revived a flourishing rainforest and expanded it furthermore. Sumeru City was built on the Divine Tree, a particularly massive tree located in Sumeru's forest region, and the sages of Sumeru Akademiya assisted Rukkhadevata in managing the nation's affairs.YouTube:  (Timestamp: 7m 54s) At the border between the forest and the desert, the Wall of Samiel was erected to prevent the forest from undergoing desertification.
Suppression of Forbidden Knowledge
Thousands of years ago,The Trail of the God of Wisdom after King Deshret and Rukkhadevata had parted ways, King Deshret's pursuit of his ideal world led him to inadvertently release forbidden knowledge into his kingdom.Staff of the Scarlet Sands People heard crazed whispers in their heads and the disease known as Eleazar - the manifestation of The Withering on human bodies - began to spread.Secret of the Scorching Desert
After learning of the plight of Deshret's people, Rukkhadevata came to their aid on account of her old friendship with Deshret. She gathered the people,The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin instructing them to build temples into which she infused the divine power of life to suppress the forbidden knowledge. Doing so expended a great deal of her power and caused her to regress into a childlike form. Even this, however, was not enough - in the end, King Deshret sacrificed himself to finally put an end to the outbreak.
Although King Deshret's people were saved, the sudden death of their god led to the fall of Deshret's civilization, whose stability had already been strained by Liloupar's orchestrated destruction of the large vassal state of Gurabad. Its people were divided into numerous short-lived city-states, including Tulaytullah, Saleh, and a state named after the original Gurabad.The Shepherd and the Magic BottleInteractables: Vaguely-Readable Inscriptions During this time, the fox-like race known as the Valuka Shuna, which had been King Deshret's subjects, only managed to survive due to Rukkhadevata's grace and they moved into the rainforest. In the process, their fur also turned green and those with darker fur have exceptionally low heat tolerance.Competition on the Sands Tighnari: My ancestors, the Valuka Shuna, were originally from the desert. But I guess this is what happens when a species migrates — they become intolerant of their original environment...
After the end of the desert's city-states era,Ancient Abscission Rukkhadevata reconstructed the Khvarena entrusted to her by the late Nabu Malikata into the divine bird Simurgh. She tasked Simurgh with guarding "the border between new birth and death."
During her weakened state, Rukkhadevata also made a promise with one of Apep's Creatures to completely erase the "apocalypse" - the assimilation of forbidden knowledge inside Apep and its creatures, which had occurred due to Apep's consumption of King Deshret's forbidden knowledge-corrupted body following his death. She blessed the creature with enough life force for it to survive in The Chasm: Underground Mines The Chasm, where forbidden knowledge is "transformed" due to the power of the divine nail residing there. She predicted that if forbidden knowledge was eradicated, Apep's creatures, which had "become" the apocalypse, would also lose a part of themselves. By changing the forbidden knowledge into something else, they would still remember it. She and Apep's creatures created the Fire Seed, which could reactivate the Heart of Oasis inside Apep and cure the dragon. However, since she was weakened, the Fire Seed was unstable.
The Cataclysm
Five hundred years before the start of the main story, Khaenri'ah's increasing use of forbidden knowledge culminated in an overflow of Abyssal powers and monsters into Teyvat.The Splendorous Sky That Day Nasejuna: Long, long ago, Dahri [Khaenri'ah] once built a facility here that connected them to realms beyond.Nasejuna: During the great disaster, which they say the Dahri started, monsters swarmed from that very facility into the nations of the world.Nasejuna: The monsters tore open a great rift that came to be called the Tunigi Hollow, and though they were sealed away with the new vein of the ancient tree, this mysterious sign appeared along with that. These Abyssal monsters wreaked havoc on the land under Celestia's control and the Withering spread uncontrollably throughout both the forest and the desert, causing decay and destruction so terrible that it was called "The Black Tide."The Folio of Foliage
To put an end to the devastation, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata embarked on a final journey with some of her followers and never returned.The Folio of Foliage The final king of the forest perished defending the forest, while the Aranara only managed to save the forest with the help of the Traveler's sibling, whom they refer to as "Nara Varuna" due to their assistance in protecting the Varuna Contraption.Festival Utsava As a result of Rukkhadevata's death, the "grass and trees never spoke again" to Viridescent.Viridescent Venerer's Determination
During the gods' battle at Tunigi Hollow, the main rift where the Abyssal creatures emerged from, they successfully suppressed the power of the Abyss - at a price.YouTube:  (Timestamp: 21m 40s)It is not confirmed that The Seven were summoned to Tunigi Hollow to fight Khaenri'ah, although multiple gods were present: the Lord of Amrita died here, and Rukkhadevata is assumed to have been present in order to transform the Lord of Amrita's corpse into the seal over Tunigi Hollow. When the former Hydro Archon, the Lord of Amrita, also known as Egeria, was killed,Vibrant Pinion her remains formed the water called Amrita. Rukkhadevata grew the Harvisptokhm from it to anchor the previous Hydro Archon to the mortal realm,The Splendorous Sky That Day and it maintains the seal on the Abyssal rift by absorbing the defilement emanating from it. Inside the Harvisptokhm lies the giant lotus Gaokerena,The term "Gaokerena" is also mentioned in 'The Folio of Foliage' Vol. 2 as the name of either Rukkhadevata's remains or the culmination of the Dendro Archon's wisdom, but it is unlikely to have any intended overlap with the Harvisptokhm's Gaokerena. In fact, the Sumeru Archon Quests state that Rukkhadevata mysteriously disappeared and the sages never found her, even though 'The Folio of Foliage' allegedly records the stories told by the sages who followed her. within which the deceased Hydro Archon's consciousness slumbers. Simurgh awoke from slumber and fulfilled her destiny, drinking from the Amrita and turning into countless motes of Khvarena, sacrificing herself to purify the Amrita from the taint of the Abyss. The thousands of specks of Khvarena she turned into created various lifeforms, including the Pari race.
It is suggested that Rukkhadevata already died by the time Simurgh completed its sacrifice.Stamen of Khvarena's Origin "The lord of sweet dew and the lord of grass and trees shall precede you in losing their divine forms...""They shall be forgotten, and only the memory of your sacrifice will be remembered." At the moment of her death, Rukkhadevata was at Irminsul, which she had been tasked with protecting. Unlike the other members of The Seven, Rukkhadevata was not summoned to participate in the war against Khaenri'ah, since protecting Irminsul was a more important task. The pollution of forbidden knowledge occurred alongside the disaster, and it had already invaded Irminsul and caused great distress to Rukkhadevata. She created the Akasha System to "borrow" her citizens' wisdom in the form of their dreams to aid her in solving the crisis, and used her divine strength to purge the forbidden knowledge, much like how she once drove it back during the incident with King Deshret thousands of years ago. However, she realized that because she was the avatar of Irminsul, when forbidden knowledge corrupted Irminsul, it had corrupted her very existence as well. Even if she died, she would live on in memories, and this meant that Irminsul could not be fully purified of forbidden knowledge contamination. Because it was impossible for Rukkhadevata to erase herself, she created Lesser Lord Kusanali from the purest branch of Irminsul to be her incarnation in the "next samsara," leaving a trail of clues starting with the phrase "Let the world completely forget me."
Legacy
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata was remembered as a goddess who had protected Sumeru "since time immemorial" by dealing with disasters and creating the rainforest so that the people of Sumeru could live in peace. Some of her most devoted followers who were researchers founded Sumeru Akademiya and assisted her in ruling Sumeru. The Akasha System, which was powered by the Dendro Gnosis, was considered her legacy; it was modified by the Akademiya at some point after her death to become the public information-retrieval service utilized across Sumeru City.Il Dottore's quote about the "Gnosis of Sumeru" likely confirms that Rukkhadevata's Gnosis and Lesser Lord Kusanali's Gnosis, which had varyingly been cited as the Akasha's power source in  and the Sumeru Archon Quests, are the same item. YouTube:  (Timestamp: 9m 0s) While Lesser Lord Kusanali had her reservations about the Akademiya's use of the Akasha, she believed it was Rukkhadevata's wish to see it taken to its maximum potential and thus did not interfere with its affairs until the sages enacted their Samsara plan during the Sabzeruz Festival.
The Akademiya greatly idolized Rukkhadevata - or at least, the wisdom that they believed she personified. After Rukkhadevata's disappearance, the sages searched for her. They found Lesser Lord Kusanali, who bore a great physical resemblance to their former Archon, and brought her back to Sumeru City. Initially, the people rejoiced at her discovery and changed the Sabzeruz Festival's date to commemorate Kusanali's birthday. However, after some examination, the sages found that Kusanali was barely any different from an ordinary human child; she had no great wisdom nor the strength of a god. Disappointed in their new god, the sages locked her up in the Sanctuary of Surasthana and greatly reduced their focus on the new god in favor of espousing Rukkhadevata's legacy.Dawn (Quest)
The device in the Sanctuary of Surasthana where Nahida was imprisoned was created by Rukhadevata as a space where she could meditate in peace. After her death, the sages reprogrammed the machine so that it could only be controlled from the outside, then placed the young god inside it. Because the dungeon was created by divine power, Nahida was unable to escape on her own.Jnagarbha Day Alhaitham: That isn't something they could've accomplished with their scholarly talents alone. In the Sanctuary of Surasthana, there's a device of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's that she once used to isolate herself while meditating.Alhaitham: Five hundred years ago, the Grand Sage at the time modified the device so that it can no longer be controlled from the inside. They're effectively trapping one god with the power of another.
Over time, and partially due to the Akademiya's misinformation campaign, the people of Sumeru have forgotten the true history between Rukkhadevata and Deshret. Some believe that a battle between the two was what created Sumeru's desert, and fanatic followers of Deshret view Rukkhadevata as a traitor who betrayed him and took the place of Archon. This perversion of the truth has allowed the sages to maintain tight control over information in Sumeru by pitting the people of the forest against the Eremites, making it easy for the sages to manipulate both groups from behind the scenes.
Over the course of the Sumeru Archon Quests, the Traveler becomes entangled in the nation's affairs when their quest to gain audience with Lesser Lord Kusanali leads them to the Divine Knowledge Capsule, which was extracted from scholars who had come into contact with Rukkhadevata's consciousness. After learning about the sages' treatment of Nahida, their ambition to create a fake god, and the Fatui's involvement, the Traveler resolves to help free Nahida and find a way to end the Withering crisis. After the Traveler defeats the faux god Joururi Workshop Shouki no Kami, Nahida obtains the Electro Gnosis that had been in Scaramouche's possession and uses it to enter Rukkhadevata's realm of consciousness, which contains her final memories. After reaching the Irminsul where Rukkhadevata's remnant is located, Nahida realizes the purpose for which she was created. Despite her unwillingness to, Nahida has no choice but to eliminate Rukkhadevata from Irminsul to completely remove forbidden knowledge. Afterwards, the consequences of forbidden knowledge (crazed whispers, The Withering, and Eleazar) disappear, but Rukkhadevata herself is written out of history, as if she never existed in the world. While she still existed, no one remembers her and all references to her are rewritten to refer to a generic "Lord of Verdure," which people understand to be a pre-amnesiac Nahida.A Toast to Victory The only individual who still remembers Greater Lord Rukkhadevata is the Traveler, a Descender, although Nahida has mentioned that she instinctively feels as though there was someone before her.
After the removal of the forbidden knowledge, Nahida finally fulfills Rukkhadevata's promise from thousands years ago with Apep's creatures and saves Apep from illness.Homecoming

<title>Anfortas</title>
<text>Anfortas was a historical figure from Khaenri'ah who lived during the cataclysm 500 years ago.
At the time the cataclysm struck, Anfortas was the Knight Marshal and the leader of the Schwanenritter. He declared himself the Marshal Regent after Irmin King Irmin became "indisposed," and led an effort to take Khaenri'ahn survivors aboveground and into Sumeru.
Profile
Little is known about Anfortas' background. His role as Marshal Regent suggests that he was a member of the Alberich Clan, given that Kaeya's childhood lessons on the clan's history emphasized how "it was the Alberich Clan, who did not have royal blood, who stepped in as regents when the strength of the one-eyed king Irmin failed."Event Hidden Strife Optional Letter: Hidden Strife Story The Brick The Brick
Anfortas likely held a large amount of influence in Khaenri'ahn affairs even before the cataclysm, and the author of Gavireh Lajavard Someone's Abandoned Letter Someone's Abandoned Letter entreats Anfortas to convince Irmin of the value of preserving some Khaenri'ahn technology made before the introduction of forbidden knowledge.

Story
By the time the cataclysm began in Khaenri'ah, Anfortas was the Knight Marshal.

Hildric died of multiple-organ failure while Ynghildr went missing during a battle against the dark beasts. Anfortas and Hadura were the only two Schwanenritter left when Hadura betrayed them and caused irreversible damage to a machine; when Anfortas went to execute them, he lost his left eye in the battle.

Lore
Siege of Poisson
The Siege of Poisson was a disastrous moment of bloodshed at Poisson which occurred over 500 years ago, before the cataclysm occurred. Shortly before the Siege occurred, an incident known as the purge of Fleuve Cendre saw Eduardo Baker, a resident and vigilante peacekeeper, arrested for resisting the purge. As he was being taken to exile in the desert, his henchmen rescued him and they rendezvoused with their nearby allies to take over Poisson, taking the Maison Gardiennage personnel escorting them as hostages and made a series of "unreasonable" demands. Those present in Poisson shortly before the Siege included Eduardo, his son Jakob, Renault de Petrichor, Rene de Petrichor, Karl Ingold, Parsifal the Great (or Josephine), Thompson and Rosa Reed, and Tom Alter.Fleuve Cendre Ferryman

Prophecy of Fontaine
At the beginning of Deluge of Wrathful Waters, an earthquake occurred near Poisson, with the water levels rising at an alarming rate shortly after. The water level only rose for a short period of time, yet the consequences of this event proved devastating, as the water was actually from the Primordial Sea. Those who were at the lower street near the water didn't have a chance to escape and quickly disappeared, while those who realized what was happening scrambled to reach higher ground, forming a stampede; some were injured while others fell from significant heights.
The Spina di Rosula initiated rescue and evacuation plans during the disaster; they were assisted by the Fatui led by The Knave who happened to be in the area at the time. In the end, 12 people were recorded to have died in the event, including Navia's bodyguards Melus and Silver who participated in the rescue operations but were not able to make it back safely; everyone else was said to be safe.Deluge of Wrathful Waters

<title>Hadura</title>
<text>Hadura was a historical figure from Khaenri'ah who lived during the cataclysm 500 years ago and helped fight against the Abyss' rampage. Their title in the Schwanenritter was "Sentinel of the Golden Hall."
Profile
Hadura was a member of the Schwanenritter, a division led by Knight Marshal Anfortas which helped fight against the Abyssal monsters during the cataclysm and led surviving Khaenri'ahns to Sumeru, traveling from the Girdle of the Sands to Devantaka Mountain. Anfortas and Hadura were the only Schwanenritter left when Hadura betrayed Anfortas and destroyed important machinery, leading to Hadura's death at Anfortas' hands.

Legacy
Klingsor was Hadura's descendant and a member of the Order of Skeptics hundreds of years ago. However, he resented the treatment Khaenri'ahns received for Khaenri'ah's involvement in causing the cataclysm, citing Hadura's efforts in subduing the monsters. This led him to doubt the Order's origin stories and believe Nagarjuna had hidden the truth.Interactable: Records of Unknown Attribution Records of Unknown Attribution (I) Records of Unknown Attribution (I)

Itto takes pride in his oni heritage and does not like those who discriminate his kind. He appreciates the sacrifice made by his blue oni brethren for ensuring that oni could be accepted into human society in the present day, even wanting to share the results with them as thanks for their efforts. He always remembers the age-old pact between the oni tribes and never uses his strength for malicious purposes, refusing to terrorize humans and steal rewards that he hadn't claimed legitimately. Due to this pride, he is extremely competitive, although he knows when to concede.
Itto also has a habit of making names on the go and maintaining his appearance no matter how severe the weather can be. Despite only being part-oni, Itto is extremely allergic to beans; making contact with one can cause significant shock, while consuming them can cause him to be bedridden for prolonged periods of time.
Appearance
Eccentric Oni
Itto uses the Tall Male Characters tall male model. He has white spiked hair with pale red streaks that goes down to his back. As an oni, he has two red horns on his forehead. Itto also has eyes that fade from red to yellow and diamond-shaped pupils and has pointed ears. His face is painted with red makeup which extends from his upper eyelid to this lower eyelid, and numerous parts of his body, arms and head are also painted with red lines.
Official Introduction
Arataki Itto: Oni of Hanamizaka with a bold heroic spirit
quote   = Hello, I'm Kuki Shinobu, deputy of the Arataki Gang. I handle the affairs of the gang. If you come across any inappropriate behavior on the part of our boss, Arataki Itto, please contact me immediately. Here is my business card.
Fast as the wind and mighty as thunder, he is an intrepid man with Oni blood running through his veins.
His key traits would be his striking horns and piercing voice that never goes unnoticed.
He is an untamed soul who is wild and free, that even a person with the boldest imagination can be surprised by him.
His heroic spirit and ardent heart guide him wherever he goes.
His happiness is exuberant in each and every passing moment!
Have you heard of the Arataki Gang before?
No? No problem, from today on, we are now acquainted. We are the Arataki Gang of Hanamizaka. Of course, you must be introduced to our most prominent leader: Arataki Itto!
Character Stories
While walking through Hanamizaka, it is hard not to notice a young man of the Oni oni race named Arataki Itto.Never mind his horns or piercing voice sticking out like sore thumbs - the sight of him enthusiastically joining in to play childrens' games is enough to set him apart from the crowd.In any case, his obvious lack of things to do stands in stark contrast to Hanamizaka itself, where craftspeople gather in droves and busy themselves all day long.Itto claims to be the "first and greatest head of the Arataki Gang," the responsibilities and duties of which he tried to explain to some Tenryou Commission officials when they came to him to investigate a rather harmless street brawl. Unfortunately, they interrupted him not two minutes into the explanation before marking him down as "unemployed."That designation is not exactly accurate, of course: other than the Gang's activities, which the Inazuma Shogunate Shogunate does not acknowledge, Itto does also do some odd jobs to stay solvent, usually working one day before taking three days off.As such, a more accurate designation should have been "three-quarters unemployed."
Objectively speaking, Itto's reputation leaves much to be desired within Inazuma City.Even though he is not considered a villain, he is certainly no law-abiding citizen either. If one really had to assign some sort of hazard level to him, then perhaps the level of being used by parents to keep naughty children in line ("If you don't behave, Arataki Itto will come and snatch your snacks away!" for example) might suffice.That said, unlike threats of "the Great Mujina Youkai grabbing you and taking you deep into the mountains," or "being inlaid upon the Raiden Shogun Shogun's Statue of the Omnipresent God statue," the scenario threatened here can actually occur.Still, "snatching" is, again, not accurate, for the fate of these snacks is decided fair and square by ritual combat!In the eyes of many, winning snacks off kids in competitions is exceedingly shameless, but Itto believes that every battle must be taken seriously, whether one's foe is a 5-year old child or the Almighty Shogun herself.It is also due to this conviction that Itto can lose to a child without any reservations at all.And while the adults have much to say about his behavior, the children find Itto the big oni to be a rather good playmate.He is knowledgeable about all manner of street games and plays them all with great gusto. He also stands up for any who are being bullied.Lately, the children have been very into Onikabuto battles against Itto.The rules of this game are simple and the fighting is both fierce and very watchable. Most importantly of all, they actually have a pretty decent chance of winning this one, unlike with other games.
For the longest time, the Tenryou Commission has regarded the Arataki Gang as a group of only occasional troublemakers who do not require that much attention.This group only has less than 10 regular members and there are many internal disagreements concerning the date of its founding.Akira believes that it all began when Itto saved him from a few two-bit ruffians. That day, Itto persisted even after having been knocked to the ground 7 times, ultimately causing the punks to back off in annoyance. Helping Akira up from the ground, Itto declared: "Well, guess you're with the Arataki Gang now!"Genta and Mamoru believe that the Gang was truly founded at the end of a certain year when they all squatted on the outskirts of Inazuma City and roasted Lavender Melons.That day, not one of them had a single Mora to their name, and they were all very hungry indeed. While gorging himself on a melon, Itto said with a sigh, "We should roast Lavender Melons like this every year!"That said, neither Genta nor Mamoru thinks that these experiences need much memorializing.For Kuki Shinobu, the Gang was officially formed the first time she had to drag Itto's sorry behind out of Shogunate gaol, for this was the first time any official records had ever made mention of the Arataki Gang.As for Itto, he believes that the Arataki Gang existed from the first moment those words entered his mind.Unfortunately, he no longer remembers when that was.And as for Granny Oni, who has taken care of Itto since he was young, she believes that the Gang was never formed.To her, these children are just "Itto and his friends."
The land of Inazuma has been home to the oni race since antiquity.They existed here alongside the lordly Hakushin Clan Hakushin kitsune bloodline and the tengu.Such youkai often have supernatural abilities that humans could only look upon in envy, but the oni lack many special traits in that regard.Other than the horns on their heads, they are mostly remembered for their explosive tempers and penchant for making trouble.As for their legendary fear of beans, it has a scientific basis.As it turns out, oni are allergic to beans. However, because the oni bloodline has thinned out greatly over time, most people display only very minor allergic reactions.Unfortunately for Itto, his allergies are still pretty severe. Forget eating beans, so long as he makes skin contact with them, Itto will get itchy all over and even find it hard to breathe.This thus makes beans the only thing that the usually carefree Itto is particularly wary of in his daily life.For their part, the Arataki Gang members do not order any dishes made with beans, not even in private, as a mark of respect for him.Of all products made with beans, Itto fears Fried Tofu the most - indeed, he even says that the very sight of it leaves him feeling queasy for three days straight.
And when one mentions Fried Tofu, a certain pyrrhic victory immediately comes to mind.The battle that caused that incident began as a rather pedestrian conflict: a Yae Miko fox-eared lady had happened to sit in the chair that Itto would customarily sit on while eating at his favorite food stand... and on his payday, no less.The two began a contest of words over whom the chair belonged to, culminating in a straight-up (unnecessary) battle.Itto, hungry from a hard day's work, chose an eating contest, while the fox-eared lady chose a theme of "kitsune ramen."Itto was momentarily at a loss when he realized that said ramen contained Fried Tofu, but with the oni race's pride on the line, he soldiered on gamely en route to victory nonetheless.And as for that innocent chair, it was ultimately given to Itto as a trophy by the rather mortified owner of the food stand.Regarding the various contests he has been in, there are two that still weigh on Itto's mind quite heavily.One of them is the rematch that he demanded of Kujou Sara, who defeated him and took his Vision as part of her duties in the Tenryou Commission.To this day, the Kujou has not agreed to the street corner sumo match, something that frustrates Itto to no end.The other incident happened many years ago when Itto was young. Then, he had gotten into an argument with a young tengu, the result of which was a sumo match in the Byakko Plain. Unexpectedly, the ensuing furor sent them both rolling down a mountain.In the end, it was the tengu who carried Itto, who could not walk after spraining his ankle, all the way home. Of course, the match went unsettled.Just his luck, Itto often thinks, that both such incidents had to do with tengu!Also, how on earth were these tengu all so strong despite looking so skinny?
Every oni child has probably heard the story of the Aka Crimson Oni and the Ao Blue Oni:The gentle, helpful Crimson Oni defeated the wicked Blue Oni, thus winning the respect of the humans.This was Itto's favorite story when he was young, and he was proud of his red oni horns and his Crimson Oni lineage.However, this simple pride was shaken by a certain incident.When incidents of robbery occurred in the village in which Itto lived, the Arataki family fell under suspicion on account of their oni heritage.Itto no longer remembers the details of that incident, but he remembers the wary, disgusted stares the villagers gave him and his parents as they left, and the parting words they said, which Itto has heard countless times since:"Once an oni, always an oni."No matter the time period, all oni are the same as far as humans are concerned. In that case, would it not be better to become the Blue Oni, whom people feared? Surely that was preferable to being like his parents, who were driven out despite having done nothing wrong.After his parents died of illness, the young Itto was turned out onto the streets, where he would lay into anyone who spoke ill of the oni race.Well, Itto was mostly the one getting laid into. But he proved quite the pain in the neck, never giving up no matter how many times they knocked him down.Still, he was only a child and eventually collapsed on the street due to exhaustion and hunger after a terrible round of beatings at the hands of some ruffians who had banded together against him.At this moment of crisis, Itto was saved by an Granny Oni old human woman."Why did you save me? Can't you see that I'm an oni?" "You must be hungry. Come, I've made some porridge.""I told you, I'm an oni! Can't you see them horns?" "Oh, I can see them. Do you want some of that porridge, by the way?""Agh, you know what, you're not listening to me at all. Oh, alright... One bowl of porridge, please." "Coming right up."
As the year was drawing to a close, the Arataki Gang met to discuss how they might celebrate the turnover of the year.As opposed to more reputable organizations, the Arataki Gang did not have any fixed venues to hold their activities, which posed some... logistical issues.The Lavender Melon suggestion was quickly eliminated. While roasting melons itself was certainly not an issue, eating only that to celebrate the new year certainly was.An Onikabuto festival was considered, but the year's end was not mating season, and so the contestants would not be half as motivated as they usually were.Ultimately, lots were drawn, and the "Great Singalong" was selected.This activity was suggested by Itto himself, and it entailed everyone standing on a cliff and singing against the ocean wind to express their innermost feelings and well-wishes for the future.The various gang members actually rejected this in their hearts when they found out about it. After all, screaming into the wind was nowhere near as fun as eating melons. Kuki Shinobu even indicated that she would like to take leave to return home on that day.However, the event went through nonetheless. The yelling and hollering were indeed quite soothing for the soul - and as things unexpectedly turned out, Itto was quite the good singer as well.
Itto's Vision was something he found under his hip after waking up one morning. By that point, he had already been in Hanamizaka for many a year, and his livelihood was at least somewhat stable."Well I never! Dad, Mom, Gramps, Granny, and Granny Oni, this... Now isn't this something?"These were Itto's real thoughts as he first looked upon his Vision.That day, he would excitedly show his Vision to every person he met, even showing people where it had made an indentation on his back until everyone was thoroughly sick of hearing the story.A few days later, however, the story would change a little:"Now as you know, I wasn't surprised at all when I first saw that Vision. I mean, you'd expect as much out of the first and greatest head of the Arataki Gang, after all!""More importantly, a person's worth isn't something that can be determined by a mere Vision, oh no, sir!"The keen-eyed, however, would notice that Itto had bought a very soft spectacle cloth.Also, a certain question showed up in the advice column of the "That's Life" magazine that went like this:"Gorou Lore Ms. Hina, how should I best take care of my Vision and make it shinier? And when I say 'shinier,' I mean shinier than everyone else's, of course!"When gang members read this and excitedly showed the magazine to Itto, they were surprised to see the long-time fan of Ms. Hina just look at the mag casually before laying it aside.

<title>Exorcist</title>
<text>Exorcists, also known as thaumaturges, are people in Liyue who have sworn an oath to cleanse the land by hunting down ghosts, spirits and demons. They are highly adept in combat, magic, and martial arts. Most exorcists are raised in families which practice the art as the family trade, although so far only one such group has been named: the Tianheng Thaumaturges.
Overview
Little is known about the origins of Liyue thaumaturgy, although it developed into its modern form 500 years ago, after the destruction wrought by the cataclysm led to a revolution in weaponsmithing and catalyst production. During this time, a shift was made which favored supernatural arts over traditional Martial Arts in Teyvat martial arts,Prototype Amber although thaumaturges continue to practice both.
Some thaumaturges in history have had close relations with the adepti. Sea Gazer in particular is known to have been friends with a thaumaturge, to whom he gifted the Fantastic Compass.YouTube:  (Video Description) It later fell into the hands of Yelan's ancestors,At Tunnel's End, Light who may have researched it as the basis for the catalysts which can only be operated by members of her clan.Danger All Around Yelan: My clan has practiced magic for generations and has created some catalysts that only we know how to use. Chongyun also acknowledges Shenhe - who was trained in the adepti arts and not mortal thaumaturgy - as a master exorcist, which suggests that the supernatural arts practiced by exorcists may be derived from, or imitations of, adepti arts.YouTube:
So far, characters who have been seen utilizing exorcist arts in-game have all been Vision-bearers, and it is unknown how exorcists without Visions perform supernatural arts. It seems that magic is not limited to Vision-bearers, but what exactly magic encompasses is left equally vague.
Known Exorcist Clans
Tianheng Thaumaturges
Heart be pure, evil be erased. Mind be purged, world be saved.
The Tianheng Thaumaturges, an exorcism clan in Liyue, has a high number of exorcists within its ranks. Chongyun's family is from the clan,Mail/My Family Say... (2022-09-07) and his aunt, Shenhe, was from a branch family.Bygones Times Like Dust Passing q=Yun Jin: I came to Mt. Tianheng once with my father as a child. [...] No wonder the legend of "The Divine Damsel of Devastation" is said to have taken place here. Shenhe never learned any thaumaturgy from her parents, as her mother died when she was a child and her father went insane shortly after and attempted to sacrifice her to an evil spirit. However, her training in adepti arts has given her techniques similar to those used by exorcists, and Chongyun recognizes her as an adept exorcist. After it was openly learned that Shenhe was actually still alive, the clan elders were overjoyed.
The clan keeps books passed down through the generations which record the evil spirits they have defeated. Despite his training as an exorcist, Chongyun has never personally met a spirit due to his abundance of yang energy, which banishes demons around him. However, he does not allow this to stop him on his way to becoming a master exorcist, though it does hinder the accuracy of the drawings in his clan's book.
Chongyun and Shenhe's mother both used weapons to assist them in exorcism. Chongyun has a sword made of ice,Chongyun: Spirit Blade and Shenhe's mother had a dagger that later ended up in Shenhe's possession.
On Birthday Chongyun Chongyun's birthday, he performed prayer rituals with the elders of the clan on Mt. Tianheng.
Known Members
* Shenhe's father (deceased)
* Shenhe's mother (deceased)
* Chongyun
* Shenhe (possibly)Shenhe's in-game affiliation is not listed as the Tianheng Thaumaturges due to her alienation from human society; however, she seems to still practice, or at least know, thaumaturgy.
Yelan's Clan
At an unknown point in the past, Yelan's ancestors inherited the Fantastic Compass, a device which can seal away evil creatures and was also previously owned by the adeptus Sea Gazer before he gave it to his thaumaturge friend. Using the Fantastic Compass as a basis, her clan developed several other catalysts, whose operating mechanisms are kept a secret within the clan.
500 years ago, Yelan's ancestors Boyang and Rongzhao were exorcists who participated in the battle at The Chasm (Area) The Chasm alongside the Yaksha Bosacius, and brought the Fantastic Compass with them. During the grueling campaign, the Millelith discovered a space which, for unknown reasons, had the power to suppress the Abyss. Boyang and several other Millelith decided to sacrifice themselves by luring the Abyssal monsters into this space - which Bosacius had already entered - and use the Fantastic Compass to seal them all within, with Rongzhao assisting with the sealing process from the outside. Rongzhao returned to Liyue without his brother, and rendered insane by exposure to Bosacius' karma.
Despite this, the clan has survived to the present, although it is unclear how much of their techniques are still practiced or if there are any members besides Yelan. Yelan possessed a family heirloom, a pair of bracelets engraved with a communication spell, but lost one of her bracelets while investigating one of Pantalone's secret trade routes. She continues to wear the remaining bracelet as an accessory and it glows when she uses her Vision.
Known Members
* Boyang (deceased)
* Rongzhao (deceased)
* Yelan (not practicing the family business)

<title>Elemental Mastery</title>
<text>Damage Elemental Reaction Damage
Elemental Mastery is an attribute that enhances Elemental Reactions.
For Overloaded, Superconduct, Electro-Charged, Burning, Shattered and Swirl, Elemental Mastery increases reaction DMG; For Melt and Vaporize, Elemental Mastery adds an additional DMG multiplier to attacks that trigger these reactions; For Crystallize, Elemental Mastery increases the DMG absorption of shields created through this reaction.
Elemental Mastery can be increased by equipping artifacts or weapons that provide a bonus to Elemental Mastery. Additionally, some characters, such as Lisa, gain Elemental Mastery by raising their character level. Other characters, such as Sucrose, can boost their party's Elemental Mastery by triggering their ascension passives.
Elemental Mastery Formula
The higher a character's Elemental Mastery, the stronger the elemental reactions the character can release.
The \% \text{EM Bonus} is calculated depending on the reaction:
*Increases damage of Vaporize and Melt by X.
*Increases damage of Overloaded, Superconduct, Electro-Charged, Burning, Shattered, Swirl, Bloom, Hyperbloom, and Burgeon by Y.
*Increases the DMG Bonus provided by Aggravate and Spread by Z.

<title>Ghost</title>
<text>Category:Deceased Characters
Ghosts are spectral NPCs that appear throughout the game.
Profile
Ghosts (also known as spirits) are the souls of those who have died, but still linger in the world and do not get reincarnated for unknown reasons.
The ghosts in Wuwang Hill and Tsurumi Island appear to be memory recreations made by the Ley Lines.
The appearances of ghosts varies across Teyvat. Most ghosts (such as the ones encountered in Wuwang Hill and Mingyun Village) still retain their original human forms after death with clear features such as clothing, age, and gender to tell them apart. The Shades of Tokoyo in Enkanomiya, while still having a human shape, mostly lack identifiable features beyond their robes (such as hair and facial features) and resemble dark ghostly mannequins that all look identical to each other. The ghosts of Tsurumi Island appear as featureless blobs that barely resemble humans in shape, and it's unknown whether this is the result of spiritual degradation from the Ley Line Disorder that affected the island or is simply a cultural afterlife belief unique to the former inhabitants.
Hanachirusato is an outlier because she is a memory recreation of Kitsune Saiguu made of "filth" by the Sacred Sakura, complete with a non-spectral physical form, and is a different entity from the original Kitsune Saiguu.

<title>Xingqiu/Lore</title>
<text>The second son of the Feiyun Commerce Guild, Xingqiu has had a reputation for being studious and polite ever since he was a young child.But there is another side to the mild-mannered Xingqiu everyone knows. A daring, adventurous and much more mischievous side...
Personality
A young man carrying a longsword who is frequently seen at book booths. He has a chivalrous heart and yearns for justice and fairness for all.
To most people, Xingqiu appears to be a polite young man who takes his studies seriously, but he also has a more mischievous side to him. In the presence of close friends and family, he is gregarious and chatty, but shows more restraint than his elder brother. Unlike his older sibling, who is completely devoted to the guild's success, Xingqiu is more reluctant to do so, putting him at odds with his family.
He is good friends with Hu Tao and Chongyun, though he pranks the latter consistently. He is an avid reader and spends most of his time looking for rare books at Wanwen Bookhouse when he is not preoccupied with his duties, writing his own books from time to time, with "A Legend of Sword" being one of his books. While it did not garner the popularity he wished for in Liyue, he is unexpectedly popular in Inazuma and Fontaine after an Inazuman merchant took the book back home with them; however, Xingqiu was initially unaware of its popularity in Inazuma.
Being the second son of the Feiyun Commerce Guild, Xingqiu is extremely wealthy and possesses a significant amount of influence, although he only resorts to using the guild as backup if the situation cannot be handled otherwise. Wishing to become a real life embodiment of the heroes he reads in stories, Xingqiu has a strong sense of justice and was able to revitalize the Guhua Clan despite being one of its younger members. He despises those who resort to underhanded methods or badmouth chivalrous heroes. Despite his carefree personality, he is also intelligent, capable of rectifying problems in his own unique way and has done so in a manner that people simply give up arguing against him if he gets himself in trouble. He claims that when his older brother takes over, he would have to do all the work for him; likewise, Yanfei has a positive view on him, as she was impressed by how he was able to keep up with her train of thought compared to the rest of his family.
Appearance
Azure Silk
Xingqiu uses the Medium Male Characters medium male model. He has golden-amber eyes, a light skin tone, and dark navy blue hair with asymmetrical bangs.
Official Introduction
Rainbows Only Come After the Rain - Xingqiu
Don't be fooled by his air and graces... He's a prankster to the core!
Second son of the Feiyun Commerce Guild, Xingqiu has had a reputation for being studious and polite ever since he was a young child. Parents in Liyue Harbor would speak adoringly of him, all secretly hoping that their own children would show as much promise as Xingqiu.
But even at a young age, mild-mannered Xingqiu had a wilder side too. Unbeknownst to his father and elder brother, he would sit for hours in the classroom reading fiction, having hollowed out used textbooks and snuck martial arts novels inside. After classes, he'd go out exploring and looking for all sorts of little ways to cause mischief.
Sometimes, his antics would even end up embroiling the Feiyun Commerce Guild in controversy. Luckily for Xingqiu, he always managed avoid blame by hiding behind an insurmountable wall of eloquent filibustering. Since no-one had quite what it took to beat him in an argument, eventually people simply learned to put up with his eccentricities.
An avid reader, Xingqiu's lifelong dream is to be the real-life embodiment of the chivalrous heroes from the pages of his books. For Xingqiu, chivalry is more than a standard of conduct - it's a mindset. The most chivalrous of all are not deterred by setbacks, nor do they stop to indulge their sense of satisfaction when things turn out as hoped. Instead, their minds are focused at all times on seizing the next opportunity to advance the cause of compassion and justice.
Despite his young age, Xingqiu has already mastered the chivalric code and cultivated the eccentric mindset that comes along with it. This gave him a knack for the style of martial arts practiced by the Guhua Clan, and he gained some renown for effectively starting a Guhua renaissance. However, eager devotees who flock to the Guhua Clan's gates in search of the master himself may be disappointed to hear the gatekeeper's awkward response: "The master is off in the mountains taking some time to himself right now... Maybe try again another day."
Character Stories
Every merchant in Liyue Harbor knows of Xingqiu from the Feiyun Commerce Guild.All see him as a kind and well-mannered young man who is an excellent student, a top talent in every sense.As the second-born son of the family, Xingqiu is not required to shoulder the burden of managing the Guild's affairs. However, Xingqiu possesses a unique scholarly talent among his peers - that is, the offspring of Liyue's wealthiest merchants - and was often praised by his tutors as a young student.Xingqiu's elder brother, while learning the family business from their father, firmly believed that Xingqiu would become a great asset to the business one day.However, little did he know that Xingqiu, after finishing the dauntingly thick volumes on commerce and philosophy, would hollow them out and sneak martial art novels into them, which he read incessantly thereafter.Sometimes, Xingqiu suddenly disappears for hours at a time with no explanation. When asked why, he simply replies: "A moment of solitude."
To Xingqiu, "a moment of solitude" can mean all sorts of things.Examples include visiting Wanwen Bookhouse to peruse the latest novels and going to Heyu Tea House to sample Yun Jin's latest drink.Sometimes, it means that he is off to fight for justice in the name of chivalry.Defeating bandits on the road, driving away monsters, helping distressed children by fetching their kites from the tree tops... there are all manner of responsibilities that fall into the category of chivalry.Inspired by tropes from his beloved martial arts novels - such as the king who wears a disguise and mingles with the common folk - Xingqiu does not hesitate to leverage the power of the Feiyun Commerce Guild to resolve more complex issues when violence isn't the answer.
One day, Xingqiu's older brother came looking for him, only to find he wasn't around. When Xingqiu later returned, he came across his brother in the hallway."Your room was a mess, so I cleaned it up. Listen, both you and I are responsible for the reputation of Feiyun Commerce Guild. We have to act the part. If you can't clean up a room, how will you clean up the world? An adeptus once said..."After half an hour of lecturing, Xingqiu was finally let go, but his brother said something strange at the end:"I'll not enter your room without permission next time... I'll make sure the maids do the same."Xingqiu had no idea what he was talking about. However, as his brother turned away, with a despondent look upon his face, he muttered to himself:"Those books under his bed... No. No, I shouldn't go looking at what kind of books they are... Xingqiu is growing up after all... Don't want to be lecturing him all the time... Puberty perhaps?"Afterwards, even Xingqiu found it odd. Expecting that one of the maids would have something to say about the stash of martial arts novels under his bed, he had long since prepared his response, but in the end, no one ever bothered to check his room again.
To keep Xingqiu from spending his whole day at Wanwen Bookhouse in Feiyun Slope, his father agreed to let him learn martial arts from the Guhua Clan. Much to his dismay, Xingqiu quickly discovered that Guhua was a dying art that had been in constant decline for years. There was no proper tuition and it turned out the luxury dojo he had signed up in didn't even belong to the clan - they had just rented it temporarily to keep up appearances.Xingqiu's father was, of course, fully aware of this state of affairs in advance. To him, the whole thing was just for fun. He thought Xingqiu would be content to learn a spot of bladework for show, not for serious self-defense.He hadn't counted on the prodigiously intelligent and extremely well-read Xingqiu being as outstanding a talent in Guhua as he was in every other discipline he had turned his hand to. A combination of his own intuition and extensive knowledge of ancient literature meant he was able to completely revitalize the dead art.Xingqiu was disappointed by Guhua's martial arts program at the beginning, but he found the other tricks they taught to be exactly what he had hoped for.Quicklime, smoking sand, paper fish, sword-swallowing, fire-breathing... Xingqiu was spoilt for choice.He decided on the spot that he would learn them all, no matter how long it would take him. He reasoned that they would be useful to have in his repertoire during his future exploits as a chivalrous hero.
There are two sides to the swashbuckling Xingqiu's personality. While quiet and unassuming in front of strangers, he is gregarious and chatty in the company of close friends and family. Though more restrained than his elder brother, he even has a playful and mischievous side.The one who usually bears the brunt of his bizarre sense of humor is someone named Chongyun, an exorcist usually found on one of the forest trails around Liyue."Chongyun... I found a haunted house for you to practice in...""Chongyun, you have to believe me... It wasn't me who laid the traps inside that haunted house- What? It's not haunted? Well... I, uh, couldn't have known that, could I?""Chongyun... Don't glare at me like that... Look, you're injured. You'd better just lie there and get some rest.""Tell you what, Chongyun, we have a maid who learned the art of essential oil therapy in a nobleman's house in Sumeru... How about I ask her to tend to your wounds? You owe me for this, though..."
The notion of chivalry means different things to different people.Chivalry means listening to your conscience calling you to action when you see an injustice, right? Or is chivalry simply about knowing right from wrong? No, that's not enough - it must have something to do with being a righteous person...To Xingqiu, chivalry simply means: be good, and do good.As a son of a wealthy merchant in Liyue Harbor, he was born to ride the waves in the world of trade. Notions of chivalry should have gradually left him as he grew up.However, obtaining a Vision changed everything - it meant he was finally able accomplish those legendary deeds he could only dream of as a child.Of course, there is no way he can completely divest himself of his duties in the Guild, but so long as he gets to go out and be the hero even occasionally, he is perfectly content with his life.The only thing that can wipe the smile from Xingqiu's face is when cynics question the true motives of chivalrous heroes.Rank, reputation, reward, shadowy deals... Whenever Xingqiu hears people smearing the names of true heroes, the expression on his face may not change, but he will be sure to add that person to the special section of his blacklist reserved for people he despises even more than carrots.
Xingqiu once wrote a martial arts novel named "A Legend of Sword" based on his own experiences, intending to publish it in Liyue Harbor.To his surprise, his manuscript was rejected by local publishing houses, who believed that no one would have any interest in a story with "a setting as wildly unrealistic as the plot is banal."Undeterred, Xingqiu had a few copies printed privately, and sneakily placed them on the shelves of Wanwen Bookhouse during one of his many trips there. But just as the publishers had suspected, it failed to garner much interest from readers. This was quite a blow to Xingqiu's confidence.Unbeknownst to him, however, a passing merchant from Inazuma did purchase a copy to bring home, where it received rave reviews. Writers the region over attempted to copy the success of "A Legend of Sword," but none succeeded - it maintains permanent residency in the number one bestseller spot to this day.
The martial arts school known as the Guhua Clan has been in decline for several hundred years now. In its heyday, the name of the Clan rang like steel throughout the harbor. It was said that the Clan harbored three great secret arts - the ways of the "Light Piercer" for polearms, "Rain Cutter" for swords, and "Life Ender" for those who excelled in both. The three arts would be refined over the generations, and with time would reach their apex. Yet the Clan's strength would continue to wane, leading to them losing their influence... The three arts became diamonds hidden in the rough, quietly awaiting a successor.After many years, the Guhua Clan would finally get one in Xingqiu. It was he who successfully grasped the ancient "Martial Principle" after merely four years of study.The Guhua weapon arts stress using the weapon as an extension of your body, and indeed this is a common idea amongst the various schools of martial arts in Liyue. But the way Xingqiu saw it, the basis of the polearm and sword was the use of a Vision. Martial artists were meant to see a Vision as an extension of themselves, and see their weapon as an extension of the Vision. Hence, he says: the arts of both the polearm and the sword are just the art of the "eye." Having come to this epiphany, Xingqiu took up a quill and penned a verse on the Martial Principle. Reading it, the Guhua head was shaken with tears, declaring that "it is not Xingqiu who needs the Guhua Clan, but the Guhua Clan that needs Xingqiu." Since then, this verse has been sealed up at the Clan headquarters at Wangshan Hall. Disciples are proscribed from reading it, much less outsiders.The verse reads thus:Guhua's arts I have studied long, in its secrets I am trained, now its long-lost depths fall upon me like the coming of blessed rain.The beating heart of Guhua's sword art is as a shower of floating flowers. One amidst may seize a bloom, but those without read only doom.The Guhua lance is a lantern's dance, like flames in night's deep glooming. Like sparks, they scatter with ease in the dark, then join like the daybreak looming.They say the sword is as your arm - I say its glint is the beholder's eye, a light like the bright dawn coming.Those who wander are burdened not. Freely they cut rain, and enlightened they pierce light. Like a snaking dragon, they cannot be subdued. In their right eye the blade, and in the other the spear.This text should have been free for all to read. The only reason why it was sealed is the dreadful handwriting.

Boss Description
Apep walked through the water like a fish with its many offspring in a sea of fragrant grass, gigantic trees, and unimaginably long vines. Finally, the grass, trees, and vines withered and turned into dust, while countless beings as minute as grains of gravel built a fragile kingdom upon Apep's land.Apep and its offspring let the sea of sand rage like boiling water and swept houses down as if they were falling leaves. Until the day when the new King Deshret Lord of Sand reconciled with the king who lost their homeland, the dunes under the sun belonged to humanity, while the dragon's oasis remained in the hearts of the dragons.Apep shared the knowledge of evolution with its many offspring, because spreading knowledge ensures dissemination while the stagnation of hoarded wisdom courted only decay. Till the day the promise between it and the Lord of Sand was finally attained, with ultimate wisdom claimed. Henceforth, it reaped only sights of oblivion, of an Forbidden Knowledge endless calamity.Apep found itself swallowed alone amidst the scenery of the catastrophe. All the people, gods, dragons, beasts, birds, and fish. All memories, wisdom, words, and hatred were ground into colorless dust, and the last of the moonlight burned away into a rain of pale fire, falling on the barren land....Apep once deemed the bottom of the sea of sand to be its grave, not the palace of a dispossessed king. The poison of "wisdom" would soon free Apep from the hatred and anger festering within it over countless moons. Apep had grown weary of the colorless apocalypse. Then, finally, the Lesser Lord Kusanali young god and the golden Traveler let it recall once again, even though the verdant land it once ruled had been reduced to this gilded wasteland, even though Apep and its many offspring had grown twisted and wretched to secure their continued survival therein, Apep still treasured the sight and scenes of the oasis, sparkling in its heart.

<title>Donatello</title>
<text>Donatello is a mentioned character in 'Genshin Impact'. He is Chevreuse's father.
Profile
Donatello was a member of the Maison Gardiennage, as a Garde. He was frequently busy in his work, often coming home late at times to his family with sweets for Chevreuse and woke up early in the morning for his shifts. Donatello's work ethic was noted by everyone, and he was well-known and praised by his wife, neighbors and colleagues, such as Vice Captain Grizzetti of the Special Patrol.
Eventually, during an important case, Donatello leaked sensitive information to the press to investigate a criminal, resulting his colleagues arriving at his home to gather evidence for the upcoming trial. When a young Chevreuse asked them what was going on, they hesitated to answer her, choking back on tears before telling her that he was an upstanding officer of the law, causing her to realize that he was an upstanding sinner. This resulted in Chevreuse and her mother being forced to move to Court of Fontaine: Fleuve Cendre Fleuve Cendre, though Donatello's colleagues would continue to visit his family, bringing gifts and news of his trial. While he was clearly guilty of his crime, they worked with the Maison Gestion to ensure that he would not suffer further castigation, and after the trial was over, was sent to the Fortress of Meropide to serve out his sentence.
After his sentence was over, Donatello began serving in the Special Patrol. To help Chevreuse follow in his footsteps as an enforcer of the law, he helped proofread her statement that she would give to the Captain at the time and subjected her to rigorous training meant to frustrate and vex her, including swimming in ice-cold water. He also taught her about the basic concepts of justice and how one should enact it. Members of the Gardes and Special Patrol also provided assistance to help her in her task. Donatello was worried about having her follow in his footsteps, but after she completed his training, deemed her to be even more suited than him in upholding "justice."</text>

<title>Interruption Resistance</title>
<text>Interruption Resistance is a hidden attribute related to the Poise system.
Poise is a hidden mechanic that determines the resistance to being staggered as an effect of taking hits from opponents.Keqingmains Theorycrafting Library:
In-game, the term "resistance to interruption" refers to hyperarmor, a multiplier that reduces incoming Poise Damage and therefore increases the amount of hits that a unit can take before being staggered.
Introduction
All characters and enemies in the game have an invisible poise bar. This bar starts full, but will drain as the defender is attacked.
Once the poise bar is reduced to 0, the defender is considered poise-broken and can be staggered by attacks.
Mechanics
Interruption Resistance/Poise
Poise Bar
The poise bar's length determines the amount of poise damage that a character or enemy can take before being poise broken.
The longer the poise bar length, the more poise damage is required. The length varies between different enemies and characters.
When the bar is partially drained, it will start to slowly refill until full.
If the defender is poise broken, the bar will stop draining. After a few seconds, the bar will reset to empty and the defender will recover from the poise broken state.
Poise Damage
Poise Damage is a hidden attribute that determines an attack's efficiency at draining the poise bar. The higher the poise damage from an attack, the more gauges of the poise bar it will drain. This attribute varies depending on the attack.
The following factors affect the amount of poise damage taken from an attack:
*Endurance from the initial stat.
*Ability Hyperarmor (a.k.a. Interruption Resistance) from abilities.
*Motion Hyperarmor during the corresponding motion.
*Level Coefficient determinded by the level difference between the defender and the attacker

<title>Prophecy of Fontaine</title>
<text>The prophecy of Fontaine '(unofficial name; referred to in-game simply as the prophecy)' is an apocalyptic prophecy said to have been foretold by the previous Hydro Archon, Egeria,When All Return to the Waters although it may have actually been divined by the Visionary, Vedrfolnir.The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur
According to the prophecy, everybody in Fontaine is born with sin that cannot be absolved. Moreover, one day, the water levels in Fontaine will rise, and all the people with sin will be drowned and dissolved, with only the Hydro Archon remaining, weeping on her throne. Only then will the sins of the people of Fontaine be washed away in a great flood.Soloist's Prologue
History
During the time of Egeria, many of her Oceanid subjects longed to live out human lives. Due to the biological restrictions of Oceanids, they would not be able to do so unless they were turned human.
After hearing the various pleas for human life, Egeria decided to grant her subjects their wish. She used the life-granting powers of the Primordial Sea in order to give these creatures a faux blood, creating humanoid forms in the progress. Due to their constitution, any Fontainian who came into contact with enough concentration of Primordial Seawater would be unable to maintain their human form since their faux blood would escape into the Primordial Seawater concentration around them, ultimately causing the failure of their human form.
Egeria lacked the proper authority to create human life and use the life-granting powers from the Primordial Seawater, angering the Heavenly Principles for their blatant violation despite their attempts to repent, casting judgement on Egeria and her creations. The now-human Oceanids would all be branded with 'Original Sin', and the actions of Egeria are what caused the prophecy to become fated.
During Egeria's reign, she helped many of the criminals of Fontaine who had previously been exiled from the nation to build a new home. This home would be the Fortress of Meropide. Egeria also used this home to guard her "secret" deep beneath the water: a large opening into the Primordial Sea. The fortress grew larger and eventually became a home for these sinners.
Following Egeria's death during the Cataclysm, one of her Oceanid familiars, Focalors, would rise to Archonhood. Focalors had a plan to deceive the Heavenly Principles from the very beginning of her duties, and created a human vessel which she subsequently separated from her godhood, Furina. Furina would act in Focalors' stead for 500 years in order to deceive the entirety of Teyvat and the Heavenly Principles into believing this human was in fact the true Hydro Archon. Focalors hid her divine self, alongside the Gnosis Hydro Gnosis, within the confines of the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale.
Using the trials that would continually occur in the Opera Epiclese, she would convert the faith of her people during these trials into Indemnitium, so that on the day that disaster would ultimately strike, she would have accrued enough Indemnitium power to sentence herself to death and destroy the Hydro Archon's Divine Throne. She would welcome the newly reincarnated Dragon of Water Hydro Sovereign, Neuvillette, to serve as the Iudex of Fontaine. When the time came for her execution, she would be able to return her Gnosis to him, restoring his full Authority over the Hydro element. Neuvillette also had many questions regarding his origins, having suffered a large memory loss due to not being born a dragon and thus Focalors hoped that by experiencing an array of human emotions at court, he would be able to understand humanity and want to protect them.
In recent times, Wriothesley took the Traveler to the Forbidden Zone in the Fortress of Meropide, showing a large sluice gate locking the Primordial Sea below the fortress. Wriothesley confirmed that if the gate failed, then all of Fontaine will be dissolved into the sea. This has led Wriothesley to build his own ship, The Wingalet, as a precaution against the prophecy. The ship was inspired by the legend of Remuria where King Remus took the Golden Bee and rode the Fortuna over the waters.Secret Keepers and Forbidden Zones However, Remuria fell to the prophecy and was sunk into the Abyss. This occurred some time after Egeria was created as a new "heart" of the Primordial Sea.Wings of Merciful, Wrathful Waters
On the day that the prophecy would ultimately come true, Furina was made to stand trial by the citizens of Fontaine on charges of deceiving her people by hiding her true identity and to pressure her into confessing her secrets. Just as prophesized, she was judged guilty by the people of Fontaine in the most historical trial in the nation's history. Shortly after she was found guilty, a All-Devouring Narwhal dangerous creature from the Abyss charged into the Opera house, and attempted to swallow many Fontainians whole, before being warded off by Tartaglia Childe in his Foul Legacy Transformation Foul Legacy form, and later on being defeated by Neuvillette and the Traveler.
Focalors would, as planned, sentence herself to death and abolish the position of Hydro Archon, granting Neuvillette full authority over the element of Hydro, and freeing Furina from her curse in the process. Neuvillette, with his newfound authority over Hydro and Sovereignty, used the powers of the Primordial Water to convert their faux blood into real blood, forgiving the people of Fontaine of their "original sin", which made them "true" humans. During their battle against the All-Devouring Narwhal, Neuvillette separated the beast's consumption of Primordial Water, allowing him and the Traveler to subdue it. The battle resulted in its roiling Hydro energies "overwhelming" Teyvat's deep seas, flooding Fontaine as the prophecy foretold; however, as the people of Fontaine were now truly human and no longer had Primordial Seawater in their bodies, they were not dissolved into water, and the waters receded just as fast as they flooded the nation. However, those who were already dissolved were not restored.

<title>Furina/Lore</title>
<text>The "Regina of All Waters, Kindreds, Peoples and Laws" is deeply loved by her people.She follows each and every trial held at the Opera Epiclese with an inextinguishable passion, and is always acutely aware of how the "audience" sees things.
Personality
The absolute focus of the stage of judgment, until the final applause sounds.
Flamboyant and imprudent, Furina lives for the thrill of the courtroom, often speaking in a manner peppered with bravado and drama. She is impatient and has a childlike temper, and she will occasionally make judgments that she doesn't mean, which Neuvillette frequently has to control while conducting a trial to avoid complications. While she enjoys being in the spotlight, she only does so when it is focused at her positively, breaking down in complete shambles should something go out of plan and will try to save face at the first possible opportunity.
It is later revealed that Furina was not the true Hydro Archon. Focalors, the successor of Egeria, had separated her divinity from her body and spirit; Furina was the Archon's body and spirit but had no powers. Focalors used Furina as a way to deceive the Heavenly Principles in order to prevent the result of the Prophecy of Fontaine prophecy regarding Fontaine from becoming a permanent reality. Furina was tasked with maintaining the guise of an Archon and cursed by Focalors so that she could not die nor pursue her own happiness so long as Focalors lived. As a new "human," she had difficulty taking the role but eventually mastered it. Aware of the prophecy that would doom Fontaine, Furina assumed the role of Hydro Archon for 500 years; while she was successful in this task, it wore her down mentally so that she suffered from severe self-esteem issues and paranoia, as shown when the Traveler convinced the court audience that she was a fraud in her trial. Despite being undying due to being cursed by Focalors, Furina remained fearful of situations that seemed deadly, as she pleaded the Knave to not kill her during an attack for the Hydro Gnosis, and was hesitant in dipping her hand into Primordial Seawater to prove whether she is the Hydro Archon during a trial.
Upon being freed of her role as an acting Archon, Furina had returned to her normal self, but without the burdens associated with her role. While she is still flamboyant and dramatic at times, she now displays a softer, humbler and insecure side of herself. At first, she struggled coming to terms with her role being over, believing that her newfound freedom meant that she was no longer needed, and had trouble reaching out for the people closest to her while she was the Archon, such as Neuvillette and Clorinde. She also planned to retire from the stage despite her love of acting, finding it difficult to take on different identities after having to sustain such a heavy burden for centuries. After being comforted by the Traveler, Neuvillette, and Navia as well as getting invited to a party by Clorinde, she realizes that her journey of self-discovery means that she no longer has to live her life in solitude. Eventually, she is able to regain the courage to move forward and go back onstage for the first time since her abdication, and learns to accept her identity not as the Hydro Archon, but simply as herself, culminating in her receiving a Hydro Vision.
Appearance
Coronated Prima Donna
Furina is a fair-skinned girl who uses the Medium Female Characters medium female model. Her eyes are Heterochromia iridum heterochromatic: her right eye having a light blue iris and deep blue droplet-shaped pupil, while her left reverses the color scheme and whitish-blue hair with light blue streaks and undertones that changes depending on her current Arkhe alignment. In her Pneuma form, Furina's hair is sectioned into two parts: a short neck-length bell-shaped bob followed waist-length locks that are tied into twin tails with several seemingly glowing blue streaks, much like a jellyfish cut when shown in full view while in her Ousia form, Furina's hair is shortened to only the bob section. A single lock of hair also sticks up and outward to her right, opposite her hat which tips to the left.
Official Introduction
Version 1
Furina: Perpetual muse of chansons and rondeaux
One lie always follows another, and so "justice" awaits inescapably at the end. The ignorant see this as some kind of farce. But if they trace back to the source, they inevitably realize that they began by deceiving themselves.
Undoubtedly, Furina has been much loved by the people of Fontaine from the moment she became the Hydro Archon.
Her charismatic parlance, lively wit, and elegant bearing - all bear witness to her godly charms.
But perhaps the thing that she is most revered for is her unrivaled sense of drama.
As the protagonist of a famous play at the Opera Epiclese once put it,
"Life is like the theater - you never can tell when the twist will come."
Furina is as inscrutable as the most cunning of stage characters, her course of action defying all prediction.
In fact it's precisely for this reason that the god of Justice and Judgment, unapproachable in her divine majesty, has such a bewitching influence.
But when the curtain falls, a hollow feeling invariably starts to creep in.
There are those who wonder whether there are moments in the dead of night when even a god like Furina feels the sharp pangs of loneliness.
No, surely not. People couldn't possibly imagine, let alone believe, that such a scene might play out.
And that's indeed the way it should be.
That is, were it not for the fact that Furina's tears had already been silently washed away by the Fountain of Lucine.
Version 2
Furina: Perpetual muse of chansons and rondeaux
She could feel joy, sorrow, and everything in between. She could be as vain and conceited, or as meek and vulnerable as she wished... As far as I'm concerned, her very imperfections are what make her perfect.
As the voices of doubt have bubbled up like a torrent, she has been forced to adopt a higher-spirited and more unyielding demeanor in her defense.
But she must also continue to fulfill her duties at hand, and can't possibly let her weakness be exposed through the rise and fall of her emotions.
The advent of an impending disaster - long foretold by ancient prophecy - draws near. Faced with such times, what is a god to do? More than anyone else, she wishes she knew.
From an onlooker's perspective, she seems distracted and weary - but she waves this off as a simple lack of sleep. As the Regina, loved and respected by her people, how could she let such buzzing naysayers get to her?
No - no matter how chaotic and urgent things get, she can't allow herself to drop the ball now, nor can she let all those years of hard work come to nothing.
Beloved by all, the one and only star of this grand opera...
Whether lonely, helpless, in pain, or in sorrow, and even if it means taking all the misery of this world onto her shoulders...
Her will to protect the people of Fontaine - every last one of them - has never yet faltered.
Character Stories
It is unlikely that travelers from other nations will understand why the god of this land is regarded as a "superstar" unless they set foot in the Opera Epiclese.Whether at performances or trials, she will always be in the seat reserved for her above the audience, laughing, scolding, falling into hysterics, to the point where more often than not she makes a stronger impression than the action onstage.People buy tickets to indulge in new sensory experiences, and in this regard, Furina is by far more popular than the absolute justice that Neuvillette represents.The forms respect can take are not limited to just lifting one's eyes up to a being above, and the unique form of respect Fontainians have for Furina is perhaps described better as "affection and fondness."She is not perfect, and may not even be very powerful, but while onstage, she is the personage the people trust the most, for she never disappoints.Among Fontainian literary circles, there is a popular saying that Furina is a memory of spring never-fading, present in the hearts of all. And who does not wish for an eternal spring?Spring is transient, but she is ever there - follow the stage lights, and you shall see her.
As the icon of the Opera Epiclese, Furina has the right to speak freely during all stages of a trial.Most of her questions are born from her curiosity and often have tenuous logical connections with the case at best, which at times can provoke raucous bursts of laughter from the audience.But just as one might begin to suspect that Furina is just there for laughs and gags, and lacks even the capability to grasp the case in its entirety, she throws out opinions worth their weight in gold.Of course, there are also times when she will express little interest in the whole process due to having earlier eaten snacks ill to her liking or missed some parade, but it is said that audience members lucky enough to be there are still pleased with this, as a god who speaks in anger is equally enchanting.There is but one circumstance in which she will not appear to act quite so willfully, and that is when she takes the stage as an actress in a musical.Fontaine has a great many musical theater classics passed down from antiquity that are, from time to time, performed at the Opera Epiclese, with key roles being played by the most popular actors of the day.Before such productions are put on, there is a phase during preparations that resembles nothing so much as a lucky draw, where the troupe will send Furina an invitation. Should the mood strike her, she will agree to appear, resulting in a stage shared by a god and humans.Once Furina has agreed to participate, the performance date for that show becomes a Fontainian festival in its own right, so popular that the Opera Epiclese couldn't possibly meet the fervent demand even if they sold nothing but standing tickets and were filled to capacity.And when the music sounds and a god takes the stage, the audience will see not their lovable deity, who does as she pleases, but the character in the script.Whether majestic or valiant, conniving or covetous, Furina is a dab hand at playing them all, perfect down to the last gesture, as if she were born to act.And it is because of her record of wondrous performances that she very much deserves to be called "superstar" by her people.Even a famous reporter from The Steambird who had barely squeaked their way backstage was completely awestruck, such that it was a long while before they remembered the interview questions in their notebook."Lady Furina, might I ask how you were able to attain such great mastery acting as an Archon, though no one has ever seen you practice?"Furina's reply was proud, albeit uncharacteristically simple. "Why, because I am a god. Next question!"
Cases and performances take up a great deal of Furina's time, and even without these two things, she still shows up for all kinds of social activities and dinner parties related to government business and diplomacy.Of course, social engagement is usually the limit of her remit, while the real behind-the-scenes work, and sometimes even certain important speeches made during these interactions, are handled by others.Furina is quite thankful for these proxies, for she has heard that her life of leisure is a rare privilege in a world where most other gods have an endless parade of duties large and small to attend to.She once considered that it might be right to set a... godly example, so to speak, and so she attempted to take part in the Palais Mermonia Palais Mermonia's day-to-day work when she had an excessive amount of free time on her hands...However, her offers were respectfully yet consistently declined by both humans and Melusines, who insisted that "there are no great duties at present that need to be handed over to our god."Though these words did make her glad, of course, after a few attempts she quickly realized how impractical it would be to use the work of the Palais Mermonia to escape her boredom.Furina actually has another hobby, known to very few, and that is playing with little animals.Fontaine's waterscapes are vast and beautiful, as well as blessed with innumerable adorable creatures. For one who always finds herself interacting with humans like Furina, this serves as an excellent change of pace.However, animal habits are inconsistent and unpredictable, and Furina's carefree attitude always seems to rub them the wrong way. As in the "if she's not being blasted in the face by Hat Jellyfish, then she's being pursued to the ends of the ocean by Hunter's Rays" kind of wrong way.It can be argued that the underwater world is more primitive and wild than the surface world, considering how little respect the animals here give a god on account of her status alone.Nonetheless, Furina did eventually discover the animal for her ministrations - the sunbathing, beach-loving, horizontal alignment-enjoying Blubberbeasts.Cheek squeezes, belly rubs, and even flipping them over, then over again, gets at most a turn of the head and noiseless protest."Hmm? You like it? Hehe, so do I!"A few mild miscommunications aside, they have since become the best of friends.
Although Furina does tend to give people the impression of one prone to wandering thoughts and only tangential concern for the rules, she does have strict standards - in certain circumstances, anyway, especially before or after performances.Everything must be to her satisfaction, be it the make or color of the props, the timing of the brightening and dimming of the lighting, or the pace and rhythm of the music.As such, sharing the stage with a god is not some shortcut to glory, but one paved with blood, sweat, and tears, to the point where even the stories of a hard-to-please superstar prima donna fond of shows and with theatrical swagger to spare has reached even the lowliest street stalls.Indeed, there was once a famous troupe that won the chance to perform with her, and pretended to agree to her exacting demands, only to default to methods they were more accustomed to during real rehearsals and performance prep.The troupe director was confident in this method, believing that given Furina's personality, she would be most willing to back down on said demands if she were appropriately flattered and saw that everything was already complete and thus too late to change - a most excellent way to save effort and trouble.But when the director began moving their props to the Opera Epiclese, he found Furina there, directing another troupe as they set up the stage rigging."Why, hello. You didn't seem interested in my opinions, so I arranged to perform with a different troupe."The director was stunned. He had planned for Furina to discover the "flaws" in her view only after setup was complete.But he could already tell that the stage sections that had been constructed precisely in accordance with her directions were significantly superior. Ordinary audience members couldn't necessarily tell, of course, but to professionals, the difference was always in the details, and these were obvious at a glance.Still, this director was unwilling to simply turn back, criticizing Furina for not adhering to the spirit of contractual obligation by not informing them beforehand of her contingency arrangements.Furina would not let this villain cast the first stone, instead scrunching her face into an expression of disbelief."You don't really think I'm that much of a gullible fool, do you? Guards! Send them on their way."
Round and round the interminable performance went, the day of the curtain call ever beyond reach, but so long as the prophecy loomed, the tale of this god must go on.Though Fontainians found no real reason to doubt Furina over the years, she knew that the collapse of trust could begin with a single crack. No matter how small, once it appeared, it would be irreversible.And the consequences of being exposed would be to reduce all her long years of work to dust, to allow Fontaine to fall - that was unconscionable!So she did her best to laugh loudly when she should be glad, and weep bitterly when she should grieve, and display the divine bearing of an Archon when it was time to show off, all without fail, all without rest.She knew that this was a performance. If she could endure until the danger had passed, she could finally take off her mask and regain the freedom to express her feelings.Yet, she slowly began to realize that the godly role she was playing was eating into her.A horrifying doubt began to creep up on her - how should she react when glad, if not to laugh loudly?Perhaps she was once a girl who did not much enjoy laughter. Perhaps she had once been the sort to give up on herself at the first sign of difficulty, but such emotions had already slipped away, bit by bit.Those in the performance arts often say that one must become a character to play them.From that perspective, Furina's performance as the Hydro Archon has been flawless. Her painstaking perseverance produced the perfect product.But no one has ever spoken of what might transpire once the last light had dimmed, for to them, the stage is fleeting.For one such as Furina, who has acted for far too long, even the path back offstage has faded into dust, buried by the sands of time.
The crisis of original sin was resolved, and Fontaine came under a new order. The affected areas were gradually rebuilt, and the people held high hopes for the future.Furina was the only one with no place in this new world. She was quick to pack her bags and leave the Palais Mermonia, nor did she return to the Opera Epiclese.She simply wanted to leave the memories that brought her so much pain as far behind as possible, and she was uninterested in the debates surrounding her - the Hydro Archon's tale was over, as it should be.But where should an actress who had finished her part and fulfilled her duty go? None could say, and the concept of "freedom" rang hollow.Furina's luggage remained piled up in her new rental apartment, and she lacked all will even to tidy up or get moved in. All she could do was lie in bed and stare at the bare ceiling.Those she knew had very quickly found their place in the new order. Whether due to their strength, duties, or friendships, their importance made them irreplaceable.In circumstances such as these, didn't "free" simply mean being someone who no one needed?Just as she had reached this conclusion, her new residence received its first guest - Clorinde the Champion Duelist.The duelist was shocked at Furina's living conditions, quickly expressing her willingness to pay for better accommodations, a notion Furina expended no small amount of effort disabusing her of. Despite this, she was dragged, however reluctantly, into at least properly unpacking and tidying up the room.Clorinde then explained that she was here to invite Furina to a gathering. The duelist rarely took part in social events, but this gathering was one of old friends, who, as it happened, also knew Furina, and whom Clorinde had not seen in a while, anyway, so she thought she'd extend an invitation.In days past, Furina would certainly have refused, for the greater the intimacy of her association with others, the more difficult it would be to conceal her true identity.The duelist smiled as Furina guiltily lifted her eyes, having seemingly already guessed the latter's feelings as well as her old reasons for snubbing such events."I don't suppose you have any reason to refuse now, do you?""Well... I'm not very good at this sort of thing, so, um... Don't you think I'd, you know, be a bit of a wet blanket?"That night, Furina finally got to experience what it was like to revel and drink with friends. In truth, she was cautious at first but was restored to her normal self within two cups - indeed, so much so that at one point Clorinde had to restrain her from leaping onto the table.For someone as reticent as the duelist, the real Furina's explosiveness was quite the surprise.As for Furina, she still knew not where to go, but if nothing else, she now knew that "freedom" did not mean solitude.
Furina once found a relatively unknown book in a library of Fontaine, and the story's main character was a servant working in an opulent mansion.The idealistic young Mademoiselle Crabaletta, following a newspaper advertisement, came to a remote manor in the mountains to apply for employment, and despite her clumsiness, became a maid there all the same.The Master of said mansion did not appear often, and though his loquacious surintendante and etiquette-minded gentilhomme managed it in his absence, she led a carefree life there.None of the manor's attendants had been to the city in quite a long while, and so the maid taught them to sing the latest songs, play the latest tabletop games, and thus the servants grew closer and enjoyed one another's company.There was but one ironclad rule, which was that none should approach the heavy wooden door that led three floors underground, behind which was locked a secret that only the Master of the mansion was privy to.Though the maid was curious, she treasured her vibrant life there too much to pry. Time passed quietly, and one day, they were told by the gentilhomme that the Master was about to visit, and so the servants hurriedly began to prepare.The banquet was akin to a festival, and laughter and cheer filled every corner of the mansion - at least, until the Master was late the second day, and upon investigating, the maid was to discover his already-cold corpse.The Gardes narrowed the suspects down to the servants, but the maid, convinced that the Master's death had something to do with the mansion's secret, at last decided to open that forbidden gate.To her surprise, what awaited her on the other side was the mansion's main hall, upon the central stairs of which stood the all-too-familiar surintendante of the house. The words she spoke, too, were bizarrely known to the maid."Ah, you must be our newest applicant. Crabaletta, I believe?"Furina was quite dumbfounded when she read that, for the story here recalled similar events in her memories.She admired the happy lives of the maid and the other servants, and the maid's courage in facing down the ancient secret to defend that life.Later, Furina dreamt of that same mansion. In her dream, she was Crabaletta, huffing and puffing as she ran to that door of secrets, and, with one deep breath, pushed it open.Behind it was a torrent of seawater that drowned the mansion in an instant, dissolving all in its wake - the Gardes, the surintendante of the house, the gentilhomme, and even herself.Furina woke with a start, looking around her to gather her wits, and the rest of the story sprang to her mind, unbidden...Crabaletta made use of the time loop triggered by opening the door to solve the mystery of the Master's death and discover the mansion's secret, freeing all its inhabitants from an ancient curse."Thank you, Crabaletta."She thanked the brave, stalwart girl for giving that tale a happy ending.And as for several vivid figures from the story, they would eventually be given lovely forms, that they might be by Furina's side.
"If you become human, you can reveal your secret to no-one. You will face suffering and loneliness... Is this still what you want?"By a twist of fate, the musical "The Little Oceanid" which nearly died before it could live, got the chance to be performed, and proved a resounding success at the Opera Epiclese.Furina, standing in for the real actress, played the heroine Clio, who sacrificed herself to guide the freshwater upon which human survival depended back to them.According to the script, she was not to take up the Vision that would appear before her as she disappeared, but instead allow it to fall into the ocean depths alone.But during the actual performance, a real Vision appeared, and it belonged to Furina.Visions are usually objects that appear in response to humankind's most fervent wishes, but this one, in particular, seemed more like a reward for her past deeds.As Furina grasped it, its reflected radiance seemed to contain her heart, filled once again by this performance.Performing had, in the past, brought her much pain, to the point where she had turned her back on the stage, but she indubitably understood the glory and brilliance of the stage best of all, and could give those who chase their dreams on the stage her matchless guidance and support.As to the question of what to do next, which had plagued her for so long, she now had a clear answer:To see this world from the perspective of the audience, and create the greatest performances without stepping onstage.No longer would her attention be focused only on musicals - as long as it's related to performance, Furina is interested in taking part from behind the curtain.Also, it is worth mentioning that though she seemed quite calm upon receiving that Vision, so much so that she even managed a few fine words, upon leaving the theater troupe, Furina immediately set off afterward to avenge herself on the "Local Legend" she had once angered by accident... which ended quite poorly for her.She returned home, dejected but not defeated. She spent all night studying her Vision, which ended up causing the entire building to flood.And once she had finally cleaned things up together with the Salon Members, she received a final missive from the apartment manager."No pets allowed in these apartments - not even if they are a Gentilhomme or Surintendante."

<title>Celestia</title>
<text>Celestia is a mysterious location that very few people understand. It is the floating island that can be seen in the sky above Teyvat, and the residence of the gods. It is currently controlled by the Heavenly Principles, although they have been silent since the cataclysm 500 years ago.Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies
It is said that only mortals who perform great, heroic feats can ascend to Celestia and achieve godhood, where they will watch over their people from above.Dr. Edith All Vision wielders are "allogenes" who have the potential to reach godhood.Ending Note
Appearance
The floating "island" actually seems comprised of several landmasses, with one large central rock and about seven to eight smaller "satellites" positioned around it. These outer rocks are connected with one single ring-like structure which again is held in place with several bridges or arches expanding from the central mass.
's ascension. (From the manga '"Prologue: Songs of the Wind"' )]]
All of these foundation rocks appear almost as if torn from the earth at some point in the past, with their surfaces covered in lush plains and forests contrasting the rough, craggy undersides. While a few signs of architecture are visible on the outer rocks, the main focus lies on the central mass, with two discernible structures made out of marble or similar white stone. The first is a smaller spire-topped structure positioned on the rim of the central mass, while the second is the more prominent central multi-storied spire which itself is topped by a massive golden construct, reminiscent of an astrolabe.
Additionally, the architecture of the central mass seems to descend deep below the surface level with a distinct inverted dome peeking out from the very bottom of the rock.
Apart from the mentioned forests and green plains on the upper surfaces of the land masses, it also appears to have several subterranean rivers bursting forth from the rock, gradually diminishing into nothing during their free fall of hundreds of miles from above the ground.
While the overall appearance is still imposing and breathtaking, even at a distance, slight traces of disrepair and wear are noticeable among the bright marble structures with broken-off pieces on the spires and bridges.
A depiction of Celestia can also be found on Tsurumi Island located in a cave below Shirikoro Peak.
Venti claims the water in Celestia tastes foul and their fruit is bland.
In Teyvat Legend
, as seen in the Mural Room in the Entombed City - Ancient Palace.]]
In other, distant worlds...Pangu gave his blood to form the rivers and seas...The gods sacrificed Purusha and cut his body to pieces......And then fashioned all living beings with those parts.The brain of the giant Ymir became clouds.Their sacrifices seeded life in the unliving cosmos.These songs sing of the primeval ones.
Celestia and those who dwell on it are an enigma to the people of Teyvat. Most people believe it is where chosen mortals ascend to become gods (or in Liyue belief, adepti) and watch over those on Teyvat.Qingzhou
Due to the amount of mystery surrounding this island, different accounts about how Celestia operates, and who qualifies for godhood and how, vary significantly. For example, some believe that adepti descended from Celestia and return there when they depart from this world;Musheng whilst other sources believe that Guhua, an adeptus, ascended to Celestia instead of dying.Rainslasher
When speaking about Vennessa, the Falcon of the West of the Four Winds who supposedly ascended to Celestia, Dainsleif claims "it ultimately does naught but hover under the light of the gods,"Bough Keeper: Dainsleif suggesting that even those who ascend to godhood are still considered beneath the Celestial gods, and not as equals.
In the distant past, humans were able to communicate with Celestia directly through heavenly messengers.Prayers to Springtime This came to an end during the war between the Heavenly Principles and the Seelie versus the Seven Sovereigns and the invaders "from beyond the firmament," which ended with the Heavenly Principles sending down the divine nails to prevent the world's collapse. These nails devastated the world below by causing massive, drastic environmental changes - likely a result of their effects on the ley lines.
Relationship to the Gods
The The Seven Seven Archons can resonate directly with Celestia through their Gnosis Gnoses, which are symbols of the Heavenly Principles' control over Teyvat and all the laws.
The prevailing belief among scholars in Teyvat is that Celestia instigated the Archon War and established the rules of the war.Treasure Lost, Treasure Found (Part 1)A Preliminary Study of Sangonomiya Folk Belief It is unclear whether the gods fought to claim one of seven divine seats in Celestia or if they already had seats in Celestia and lost them upon death, but at the end of the Archon War, the Seven Archons were established out of the victors.
Interestingly, while the Heavenly Principles has been referred to as a single entity, in the Manga's Prologue chapter, Venti recalls three enigmatic, shadowed figures when Vennessa asks about Celestia. He visibly grows uncomfortable at the thought and quickly changes the subject. There is currently no way to determine who those three characters might be, or if they will ever be brought up again.</text>

There is also a locked solitary confinement room, which is almost exclusively used by Klee, as well as an upstairs area that is currently untraversable.
The library was formerly a bathhouse created by the aristocracy for their personal use, and Ragnvindr converted it into a library after Vennessa's rebellion. At one point, it was the largest library in northern Teyvat, but was reduced to one-sixth of its original size following its destruction during the "Great Fire of Fall Equinox."Favonius Codex It is unclear whether the rest of the headquarters was converted from the aristocrats' baths, or if it was built following the Great Fire of Fall Equinox.

Amber's grandfather was the founder and leader of the Knights of Favonius Outriders Outriders of the Knights of Favonius. His granddaughter, Amber, eventually followed in his footsteps and became the sole remaining Outrider. He was also the mentor of Eula, the Reconnaissance Captain of the Knights of Favonius. His current status is unknown.
Profile
Story
Amber's grandfather was a mercenary from Liyue and the leader of a mercenary group that took on merchant caravan protection jobs. One of these jobs went wrong, and Amber's grandfather was the sole survivor, saved by a doctor from the Knights of Favonius. As he was too ashamed to return home and also wanted to repay the debt, he joined the Knights of Favonius. He founded the Outriders and personally trained all of its members.
Later, he fell in love and started a family in Mondstadt. His granddaughter, Amber, was born years later. When she was young, Amber would secretly watch her grandfather training the Outriders, and sneak outside at night to practice the moves he taught.  Moved by her enthusiasm, he decided to teach her everything he knew. At some point in Amber's youth, he also became acquainted with Eula, an estranged member of the disgraced Lawrence Clan who was struggling to deal with the shadow her family's dark past cast over her life. Amber's grandfather took her under his wing and trained her. The two were similar, one an outcast of Liyue and the other an exile of Mondstadt. She became a beloved student to him and a close friend to Amber. Amber's grandfather taught Eula an open-mindedness and down-to-earth persistence, helping her to find herself and discover a way to persevere through the difficulties her bloodline caused her.
Four years before the start of the game, Amber's grandfather left his coat of arms and sword in his office and disappeared without a trace, shortly after Amber had been admitted into the Outriders. After his disappearance, Amber committed herself to continuing as an Outrider, desiring to take up her grandfather's former role as Mondstadt's loyal protector.
Based on the description in the Qingce Village Bulletin Board, it is implied that he returned to Qingce Village, but where he lives or why he came back is unknown.

<title>Alhaitham/Lore</title>

Personality
The current scribe of the Sumeru Akademiya, a man endowed with extraordinary intelligence and talent. He lives free - free from the searching eyes of ordinary people, anyway.
Alhaitham is a scholar who is fueled by a desire to understand the underlying principles of the world around him.YouTube:  He greatly values the pursuit of knowledge and dislikes meaningless noise and matters that distract or divert him from his chosen pursuits. To this end, while he is unambitious and enjoys leisure, he will do what he deems necessary to maintain a comfortable life.A Toast to Victory As a result, he is not fond of being a leader, refusing the position of Grand Sage and when thrust upon the position of Acting Grand Sage, expresses an intent to resign as soon as possible.Pride and Prejudice
Alhaitham focuses greatly on himself at all times. However, he does not do so out of a disregard for others; instead, it is a result of his rationality. For example, he believes that as it is impossible to save everyone, it is important to focus on one's own well-being first.Cry From the Eleazar Hospital As a result, he frequently squabbles with Kaveh due to their contrasting ideals and personalities. Contrary to what his peers think, Alhaitham does not look down upon anyone and tends to give equal weight to everyone,A Thorough Investigation be they human or god. He also places great importance in the value of humanity and has astute insight into human nature. While he does not keep this a secret, he rarely bothers to correct others' unfavorable assumptions unless it would prove more troublesome to allow them to persist.
Appearance
The Rational
Alhaitham uses the Tall Male Characters tall male model. He has pale skin, gray hair that turns lighter at the ends and with a few locks that have pale turquoise undersides, and light turquoise eyes with orange-ringed yellow pupils. He wears two large gold and green earpieces.
Official Introduction
Alhaitham: The art of learning, thinking, and doing
I can't deny that he's very smart. However, it's a shame that a man of such talent only pays attention to the truth itself and not to the people around him. Or perhaps this is due to an extraordinary sense of individualism, which causes a lot of problems. For example, he doesn't seem to respect his seniors... Of course, I'm not referring to myself specifically.
The current scribe of the Sumeru Akademiya. This title may sound very impressive, but it's really because the Akademiya has a culture of using official titles to inflate one's ego.
The role of a scribe may seem prestigious, but the truth is, a scribe does not have to be present at all major meetings, nor does he participate in core decision-making. The scribe is simply responsible for classifying and archiving important documents, and his presence is not required at all times. It is for these exact reasons that in Sumeru, where books and manuscript documents were once managed as a resource, the scribe is one of the people in the entire Akademiya who is in the know about various matters. In fact, one can say that this position is rather similar to that of the Grand Conservator. After all, the person who manages the various texts is the one who has privileged access to profound wisdom.
Alhaitham, the current scribe of the Sumeru Akademiya checks all the boxes above. Not many people know who he is, but he knows a lot of information that is unknown to everyone. He does not attend any non-essential meeting, and when he does, he only records key points, jotting down other minute details based on his mood. People don't often pay attention to him, let alone know how much detail this scribe can detect in a simple meeting.
A capable person who keeps a low profile for too long is often perceived as someone with a mysterious identity and ulterior purposes. Alhaitham himself is a powerful rebuttal to all these cliché views: he is a brilliant man, but he is only an ordinary employee of the Akademiya, with a stable job and a cushy house in Sumeru, leading a carefree and comfortable life.
Character Stories
A capable person who keeps a low profile for too long is often perceived as someone with a mysterious identity and ulterior purposes. Alhaitham himself is a powerful rebuttal to all these cliché views: He is a brilliant man, but he is only an ordinary employee of the Akademiya, with a stable job and a cushy house in Sumeru, leading a carefree and comfortable life.Sometimes, people find it next to impossible to catch the current scribe in his office. Little do they know about the scribe, other than his name, "Alhaitham," and that he is supposed to be present during work hours. The fact is, no one knows his whereabouts, and all they can do is leave documents and files on his desk.Alhaitham couldn't be more satisfied with how things are. The man might be at home or in the library, but he'll never appear where people wish him to be.Having an entirely unpredictable schedule affords undisturbed freedom.
The title of a "scribe" may sound impressive to most Akademiya students, but this fancy name is just a product of the Akademiya's culture to use unnecessarily high-flown titles.In truth, the scribe does not have to be present at all major meetings, nor does he participate in core decision-making. The scribe is simply responsible for classifying and archiving important documents. However, in Sumeru, where books and manuscript documents were once managed as a resource, the scribe is one of the most "in-the-know" people in the entire Akademiya. One can say that this position is rather similar to that of the Grand Conservator - after all, the person who manages texts will have privileged access to profound wisdom.As the current scribe of the Sumeru Akademiya, Alhaitham acts in perfect compliance with his role: He does not attend any non-essential meetings, and when he is required to be present, he only records key points, jotting down other minute details based on his mood. If the meeting does not affect his personal interests or fails to pique his curiosity, he will not be bothered to give any comments. He does make comments, however, when someone has come up with something offensively foolish - and one should expect these comments to be more blunt than necessary.Such is Alhaitham's life philosophy: Whenever the need for his judgment arises, one must be ready to accept any means and privileges he might require to make that judgment. Fortunately for everyone, Alhaitham notes that he is too lazy to possess too many ambitions.All scholars seek knowledge and the truth. Some do so for fame, while others, for ambition. And some others enjoy conquering knowledge and the truth, transcending them, and savoring the sense of superiority in the process. Alhaitham isn't any one of them. He is only driven by what intrigues him. He believes that many scholars have already become lost in their pursuits, taking the truth as a tool or even a shortcut to self-realization.However, whether one seeks it or not, the truth is always there, hanging high above the sky like an illuminating star. It is not the end of a trip or the destination of a match. It is and shall remain constant, regardless of human existence. Also, human pursuits will not simply end after certain knowledge has been acquired - though people never doubt that they can claim the fruit with joy and are prepared to sacrifice everything for it, their desire for knowledge will keep them going.Those who fail to see through the truth set themselves on an endless path, while those with clear minds will say: The truth did not come into being to serve anyone, and whoever is unable to harness their desire for knowledge will be destroyed by it. Such is the rule of the Nation of Wisdom. Of course, if you want to blend in, you are welcome to fake such a posture.
To the people of Sumeru, those who played a part in the operation to save Lesser Lord Kusanali are deemed to be heroes. However, a great many who make such compliments don't really know the full story. They simply repeat a fragment of a tale that they find inspiring. As one of the protagonists in their stories, Alhaitham has no opinion whatsoever about being a "hero," nor does he believe that these stories are worth talking about.Meanwhile, Alhaitham has declined the Akademiya's offer to become the Grand Sage multiple times. But given the chaos in Sumeru, Alhaitham eventually agreed to serve as Acting Grand Sage temporarily.It already defied common logic for someone to refuse the titles of Sage and Grand Sage, and yet Alhaitham went further still, resigning and returning to his humble role as Scribe at the agreed-upon time instead of clinging to power.If he did manage to gain anything from it at all, it was the financial benefits: His salary stayed the same after his resignation, not to mention the several high-quality research projects that he was able to complete on his own. There is no doubt, then, that he will lead a well-off life. In addition, his interpersonal relationships have also improved, as he has more or less befriended the other participants in the archon-saving operation - they have gotten close to the point where Alhaitham might greet these people with a nod or two when he sees them.Sometimes, Lesser Lord Kusanali will also invite Alhaitham to the Sanctuary of Surasthana to discuss various matters. He has met many people there: the General Mahamatra Cyno, the mercenary Dehya, and Nilou, star of the Zubayr Theater. Nilou even once asked him: "How did you manage to come up with such a bold plan? When I think back on it, we were all quite lucky to not get hurt..."Nilou hesitated before she continued, and Alhaitham understood her confusion, for anyone would have wondered how he could have stayed unscathed despite the influence of the Divine Knowledge Capsule. But in Alhaitham's eyes, he was never in danger, for he had never used any capsules.As for how he had managed to do that, it was all thanks to his role as the scribe. As a scholar lucky enough to have read the Akasha's system manual, he had studied the headset and Canned Knowledge, such that he knew how to alter the status signal of the Akasha. He had even once thought of reversing the holographic shield of the Akasha Terminal and projecting it to the back of his head to offer protection from attacks on that front.It has been proven that a plan lays the foundation for everything, and that prior research lays the foundation for a plan. Alhaitham, who had no interest in boasting about how he remained unscathed, answered Nilou's question with another: "As far as I know, Cyno and Dehya are also curious about this, yet you are the only one who has raised this question. Were they just too shy to ask me themselves?"
Alhaitham seldom discusses personalities or dispositions with others. He believes that the prevalent theories about them are wrong. Suppose someone insists that one's character has nothing to do with their abilities and opinions, the person with such a view will find themselves unable to judge any aspect of another person. A smart person will often hold different attitudes towards a foolish person and another smart person, and the foolish often think differently when facing success and failure. People's views on Alhaitham are proof of this point - given his superb talents and egocentric personality, no one wants to get too close to him, but still, they see him as an outstanding scholar.This is exactly the public image Alhaitham desires. Many scholars are rigid and inflexible, but Alhaitham is not one of them. As a matter of fact, his occasional sarcasm in part reflects his philosophy. Society (or the collective) relies on rules to regulate individuals, and language is one of these regulative tools. Turning language against its original design serves to challenge unreasonable rules, and one can thus stay out of trouble.The word "talented" is abused within the Akademiya, and so are "born differently," "touched by the archon," and such... In Sumeru, one's talents are a trial. Outstanding talent is not necessarily seen as a perfect gift, but it also divides people. For instance, to compliment someone with unimaginable achievements, ordinary folk often call them a "genius," or "superhuman," or a "prodigy"... But upon reflection, one will soon notice another layer of meaning that even the speakers themselves have not realized: That the talented and the ordinary are categorically different.If someone is capable of things that others aren't, they must have been endowed with some special abilities and gifts. Excessive compliments for and wild imagination regarding outstanding people only serve to alienate them. "They are successful because they are different" - such is the typical excuse favored by underachievers. These ignorant notions mean nothing to Alhaitham. Though he does know his way around people, he will not waste his time on such trivial matters.Rules define borders and set limits. Yet these rules should not be judged solely on the number of people they limit. Therefore, Alhaitham has come up with his own set of rules with which he perceives everything and challenges the world. It is the crystallization of his philosophy. To maintain these rules of his own fashioning, Alhaitham acts on his own will and deals with anything that appears harmful in his eyes.Only with objective judgment can one see the truth. By acknowledging the differences between individuals and recognizing differing levels of capabilities and mental capacities, one will discover the answer right away: Judgment from others is inconsequential, but to leave the right of judgment in others' hands is equal to denying oneself. To be "different" should not simply be a label given to you by others. Rather, the talented should have long understood that their uniqueness is also a gift.To put it another way, when a talented person truly understands that they are different and that they are indisputably ingenious, only then can they truly understand the value of their abilities. And as for cowards who remain blinded by perspectives advocated by the great majority, they have not yet found their true selves.
To live a peaceful and comfortable life, one must meet a few requirements first: Congruous personality and logic, adequate fighting prowess, a slow-paced job, and a cushy house in the vicinity of one's office.Alhaitham has checked all the boxes above. He would never deny that no place suits him better than the Nation of Wisdom, where social capital is linked to one's academic abilities.Alhaitham's Home His current house, which is located near the Akademiya, is one of the academic resources that he gained through promising research projects. This house's story dates back to Alhaitham's student years. If his classmates still remember him, they will recall that he was not one to mingle with the crowd. As a result, he has only participated in one joint research project. Despite its eventual success, the project resulted in a huge quarrel and a parting of ways. Little do people know about Alhaitham's part in this story, though they might be acquainted with the other protagonist: The Kshahrewar architect Kaveh.This academic incident is not very widely-known - and in truth, the tale of two geniuses falling out due to differing perspectives is an all-too-familiar one in the Akademiya. But even though their collaboration did fall through, neither of them will deny the other party's exceptional brilliance. As for their research, the Akademiya would later transfer the relevant assets to the researchers involved as per regulation.Although the two did not continue that research, its great success in the early stage still serves as compelling proof of Alhaitham's academic ability. Later, the Akademiya even used this project, which they had forgotten to cancel, as a reference for allocating housing resources, and as such, Alhaitham was given a very decent house befitting his participation in this ingenious project. But the other contributor, Kaveh, had never approached Alhaitham regarding that allocation. It wasn't until later that Kaveh had someone inform Alhaitham and the Akademiya that he was not in want of a house and thus had no use of this property.When next they met, Kaveh had gone bankrupt. According to Alhaitham, this former friend of his possesses a personality and values that are not congruous with his abilities. The two differ on too many things and cannot reach a consensus even today.Allowing Kaveh to stay in this house provides Alhaitham with an interesting research topic: Legally and socially speaking, since Kaveh has previously forfeited the right to his half of this house, he should pay the landlord during his stay. However, paying rent would, to some extent, deny his contribution to the research, which contradicts the academic spirit.An intriguing matter to consider, but Alhaitham has no interest in the answer. Thus, he has taken his broke former colleague in, collects rent as the rightful landlord, and gives his colleague some household chores. He is well aware of the dissatisfaction Kaveh might have, but it matters not to him. As far as Alhaitham is concerned, Kaveh is a familiar face, similarly lacks familial attachments, and is the polar opposite of himself as a scholar - that is to say, an excellent mirror. Human vision is limited, but it can be perfected through the presence of another genius. Taking this opportunity, Alhaitham will be able to observe other aspects of this world and thus understand more things that may have otherwise been unfathomable.
The Nation of Wisdom places academics and knowledge above everything else. As such, a scholar acknowledged by others within the Akademiya usually possesses a higher social status. Alhaitham was born to just such a family of well-received scholars. His parents died very early in an accident, and he was raised by his grandmother, a Kshahrewar scholar.Alhaitham doesn't have many recollections of his parents. He learned from his grandmother that they were both employed by the Akademiya, with his father being a mentor in Haravatat and his mother, a renowned scholar in Vahumana.Alhaitham has inherited his parents' intelligence, and he was always the sharp kid amongst his peers, so much so that he started reading abstruse academic journals at around the age of seven. Having noticed his exceptional talents, Alhaitham's grandmother suggested that he attend school early. However, it only took half a day in the Akademiya for little Alhaitham to report this back to his grandmother: Everyone he met there was boring and he preferred reading alone to listening to their meaningless courses. Alhaitham's grandmother saw his parents' talents and personalities in him, and agreed to let him stay home to be self-taught.To Alhaitham, "to be self-taught" means to read, break down, reorganize, and question. Due to his family background, he was lucky to be exposed to books made of paper. Interestingly enough, he takes more pleasure in reading his grandmother's hard-copy collections than obtaining knowledge from the Akasha directly.As opposed to the Akasha, books are inflexible and rigid, and there is no guarantee that their contents are error-free either. To use such a medium of knowledge is to dance with potential misinformation. The majority of people in Sumeru hate this, but Alhaitham derives great enjoyment from it. It was from reading that he acquired the ability to learn, analyze, and even rectify, and ultimately, he has learned to question. If the rustic and primitive method known as reading is ever any trouble, it is trouble that Alhaitham appreciates.Alhaitham's grandmother told him: "You and your father both like reading. Now, I can't say if the two of you have been given too much share of wisdom or not, but always remember that being different is a gift."Knowledge is to be recognized, pursued, and trusted, but one should never forget to question it. Perhaps only those who come to such an understanding will not be easily moved by Canned Knowledge and other convenient knowledge media. And only someone who had already met these prerequisites would have casually read the Akasha manual sealed deep within the House of Daena.As Alhaitham's grandmother had said, books contain useless information, and sometimes in large amounts, but his sharp mind will sift through them - and if a book he has read lingers in his memory, it will come in handy one day.After his grandmother's passing, Alhaitham managed her funeral on his own, inheriting her properties and her small library. Before she passed away, Alhaitham's grandmother gave him this earnest blessing: "You are such a smart child. Many such people have large egos and a propensity to act on their own. You are outstanding and possess a broader horizon than ordinary people. This is not a bad thing, but you must take care to have a clearer mind than others. You must understand that vain pursuits are but dust, and that you must discern your path with the greatest of wisdom."Later, Alhaitham applied for the Akademiya and was immediately admitted, scoring high marks in the Haravatat entrance exam. He was informed that his grandmother had also applied for him to be able to attend classes in other Darshans. Following his late grandmother's advice, Alhaitham has always kept a low profile and a clear mind, and always makes decisions for himself.Years later, when Alhaitham moved into his new house, he brought all those books over. While sorting through them, he flipped through a few that he had read long ago. The journals that had well-wishes written on their title pages were from his mother's collection, and the ones with reference materials inserted between pages and notes on the margins had once belonged to his father. On top of them, there was a thick book with an exquisite, emerald-colored cover. On the title page, his grandmother had written thus: May my child Alhaitham lead a peaceful life.
A sturdy and durable green belt pouch.People often mistake it for a wide belt, an impression perhaps reinforced by its color being in perfect harmony with Alhaitham's outfit.There are only a few things in this pouch: Keys, some recent read of Alhaitham's, and a portable music player that goes with his headphones.Alhaitham personally made the music player when he first became the scribe, and it is connected to the headphones via cables of the same color. He sometimes uses the gadget to play music, and other times, to block noise.
"The value of language is not limited to words. A unified language helps to govern thoughts. Language is the bottom line, rules, weapons, and violence. By making our language unique, we can open up a special path to the relative completion of minds.Governing thoughts may appear meaningless to some, but to others, it has a very significant meaning. Individuals' pursuit of uniqueness gives rise to various languages and media. People are controlled by language under many circumstances."As Alhaitham flipped through these pages, reaching the end of the book and its back cover, he realized that an intricate ornament had been underneath the tome this whole time.Of course, he knew what it was - a Vision, the proof of one's power. However, this item did not mean much to him.A believer might have perceived this divine item to be a thing most lofty, but to him, it was no more than a useful tool.Alhaitham was out on a research trip when he was given the Vision.He didn't plan to dwell too much on it. It belonged to him, after all, so what difference would it make if he checked on it tomorrow, as opposed to today?And just like the knowledge he has acquired, what he has obtained shall always remain in his possession.

Personality
Every citizen of Mondstadt adores Barbara. However, she learned the word "idol" from a magazine.
The Deaconess of the Church of Favonius, Barbara. She's hardworking, bright, charismatic, and optimistic, yet may be clumsy sometimes. The sight of the Idol of Mondstadt makes everyone have something of a "second wind" and become motivated.
Even after being a successful figure in Mondstadt, she feels doubt and feels disillusioned whenever thinking of the duration of one's smile on other's faces after hearing her song. Her desire for fame and recognition changed into the desire to help others in times of need. Though depressed, she cheers herself back up, not letting herself be down or depressed for 30 seconds.
She feels inferior to her "big sister" Jean, thinking everything she's done is of inferior nature to the Acting Grand Master and strives to do something that surpasses Jean's deeds at least once. She's the deaconess of the church, meaning she safeguards religious artifacts and worships Barbatos, although obliviously unaware that she has met Venti him.

Barbara: "The best magic is diligence."
I just want to see Barbara to make my day a bit brighter!"
▌Deaconess of the Knights of Favonius · Barbara
"The best magic is diligence."
Barbara, the Deaconess of the Knights of Favonius, is a shining starlet beloved by the people of Mondstadt.
Her Hydro power is the best remedy for a wound, just like her soothing singing and dancing is solace to a weary heart.
The people of Mondstadt all think Barbara has some kind of magical power that can heal both the wounds and the heart, but only Barbara herself knows that the secret of such magic is diligence.
Character Stories
Barbara is the Deaconess of the Church of Favonius, as well as the shining idol of Mondstadt."The sight of Barbara makes all my problems disappear." This is quite a common saying among the citizens of Mondstadt.In fact, Barbara can do much more than just put people in a better mood: Her healing powers extend to flesh wounds and other physical ailments.Barbara is known to have access to miraculous healing powers through her Hydro Vision.However, Barbara herself knows that hard work is the most miraculous magic of all.
Every citizen of Mondstadt adores Barbara.However, this has not always been the case. At first, Barbara's songs sounded strange to the citizens of Mondstadt, and many struggled to see the appeal.This was because for the longest time, the folk songs of bards were the only popular songs known in Mondstadt.Fortunately, Mondstadt stayed true to its reputation as the City of Freedom, and the people ultimately embraced the new while continuing to cherish the old.People accepted Barbara's songs, and over time her positive energy rubbed off on them. Soon, they could be heard humming her tunes all around Mondstadt."Albert, would you stop please! You're completely out of tune!"
Barbara's feelings on her own success are mixed.To the extent that an idol's duty is to make everyone adore her, she has done a fantastic job.There is no doubting that she has made the right choice.However, an idol is also expected to spread joy and relieve people's spiritual fatigue... Has she really accomplished that?She sang for blind Glory, encouraging her to believe that her lover would one day return. She sang, too, for sick Anna, promising her that her illness would one day be cured.Yet, the smiles on their faces never last long after the songs end.This has led Barbara to become somewhat disillusioned and doubtful.
Barbara has always been a bright and optimistic girl since she was young. Though at times she can be a bit clumsy and mess things up, she always bounces right back and has another go.Barbara is the complete opposite of her Jean sister, who is seen by all as the pride of her family.Unlike Barbara, her sister has always been the very definition of success in all aspects.Initially, all Barbara had ever wanted was to surpass her sister in at least one thing, even if only once.However, be it swordplay, her grades, or anything else, she was never able to compare.Even for someone as optimistic as her, she found herself to be upset and down."Hard work is the most miraculous magic. But when even that doesn't work... what then?"
Barbara has never once considered giving up.Her determination and resilience even surprised her father, Seamus Pegg, the Cardinal of Daybreak.Barbara only allows herself to be depressed for 30 seconds.After that, she forces herself to brighten up, no matter what."I'm not so good in combat, so I'll be sure to support those who are."Under her father's counsel, Barbara became a healer.She is as radiant as the sick and injured are pained.Her desire to be recognized gradually transformed into a simple desire to help others.
"Thank you" are the two words that Barbara hears most often.When she feels lost, she will suddenly find that there is someone wanting to hold her hand."Thanks for being here with me. I feel so much better."To Barbara, the greatest reward is seeing the smiles on people's faces.Therefore, whenever she is massaging her swollen calves or drinking tea to care for her sore throat, Barbara recalls all those who have been kind to her."It's the encouragement I receive from others that keeps me going."Just maybe, the smiles she receives are proof that her songs really can heal people.Her ambition to surpass her sister and become the most popular person in all of Mondstadt hasn't been abandoned by Barbara, it is simply buried deep inside her heart."If only I excelled more, perhaps I could be of help to Jean."This is what she believes."Okay... Barbara, go!"
"...Idol?"The first time that Barbara heard this strange word, she was visibly confused."But... aren't The Seven the ones that people are supposed to worship?""Yes, but not exclusively..." replied Alice, an elder of the Hexenzirkel, as she groomed the young girl for stardom. "Read this, it contains everything you will need to know.""Idol Magazine" was the name of the assigned reading material. Barbara had no idea what world this magazine had come from, but by reading it she found out that there was indeed such thing as an "idol," and that it mainly involved working hard at getting everyone to like you.She also discovered that an outstanding idol is capable of not just bringing joy to themselves, but also bringing spiritual healing to others through the power of song and dance.Barbara set about learning one new song after another, dancing to the beat as she went. Finally, she found happiness, and she found it in the smiling faces of others.Some time later, when Alice anxiously relayed to Barbara that plans for "Teyvat Idols!" were falling through, Barbara was starting to make a name for herself through her performances in Mondstadt."Hmm... Well, if I'm the only one left... I guess you can leave it to me to define what it really means to be an idol!"Driven by this ever so slightly selfish ambition to spread joy and healing to others, Barbara is slyly swotting up on new tunes behind the scenes to this very day.
The story of how Barbara obtained her Vision is hardly the typical tale of high-stakes heroism.She had just joined the church and was looking after a little boy with a high and persisting fever.Nothing Barbara could think of would console the boy and bring an end to his relentless tears.Someone remarked that while the boy had already taken his medicine, there was no way to cure the pain of missing one's family.Another suggested that Barbara sing a song for the boy to raise his spirits.Barbara had never sung a song in her life up until this point, but how could she shy away from it in a moment like this?"Never having sung before is no reason to abandon a child in their time of need," Barbara thought to herself.And so, Barbara took the boy in her arms and sang him a song: a lullaby, the only song she knew.It was an unceremonious beginning to her singing career. After quickly realizing that she barely knew any of the words, she had to resort to humming the tune instead.Nevertheless, her voice began to soothe the child, and so she kept singing. She sang the same song, over and over again, until her throat was dry and her voice was hoarse. Finally, the boy fell asleep. Exhausted, Barbara lay down by the wall and fell straight asleep herself.Early the next morning, Barbara awoke to discover that the boy's fever had come down. Perhaps it was because she had sung for him, or perhaps it had something to do with the Vision which had mysteriously appeared next to her hand at some point during the night.Barbara was not preoccupied with the Vision, however. It was the sight of the boy smiling once again that filled her heart with joy.Barbara received her Vision for the simple but beautiful wish that took hold in her heart that night: A dream of healing the sick through the power of song.

<title>Plane of Euthymia</title>
<text>The Plane of Euthymia is the world inside Raiden Ei's mind, where her consciousness currently resides after she discarded her physical form around 400 years ago.The Servant's Path
Accessed During
The Plane of Euthymia is accessed during the following quests:
Amidst Stormy Judgment;The Omnipresent God;The Lonesome Euthymia display=bullet
Lore
In the past, Yae Miko taught Ei how to place her consciousness into objects.The Omnipresent God This technique allowed Ei to create the Plane of Euthymia, her inner world which she placed within the blade Musou Isshin.
The Plane of Euthymia is part of Ei's plan to achieve eternity for herself. Over 400 years ago,According to Wanderer's Wanderer Lore Character Story 2 Character Story 2, Ei entered the Plane of Euthymia the same year that the Tatarasuna Mystery occurred. In the The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call, Sawada found government records which showed that the people involved in the Tatarasuna Mystery lived over 400 years ago. she successfully created the Shogun, an identical puppet whose body would not succumb to death or old age, and left this puppet in charge of pursuing Inazuma's eternity. Ei herself secluded to the Plane of Euthymia, a space which reflects her inner world, to meditate and prevent the erosion of her spirit. Ei can still monitor the outside world from within the Plane of Euthymia, and can assume control over the puppet's body at will.
Present Day
In the past few hundred years since entering the Plane of Euthymia, Ei neither permits anyone to enter the Plane of Euthymia nor leaves the Plane to check on Inazuma. Because she only cares about affairs which directly pertain to eternity, she pays no attention to everyday life in Inazuma, and despite understanding the circumstances behind the Vision Hunt Decree, deems this irrelevant to eternity and tacitly approves it.
This state of affairs is finally broken during the Amidst Stormy Judgment, after the Traveler interrupts the Vision Hunt Ceremony. The Traveler's ability to use the elements without a Vision marks them as an exception and thus an "enemy of Eternity," causing them to be brought into the Plane of Euthymia for Ei to personally judge their strength. The Traveler's consciousness leaves the Plane after their defeat, but the fact that they met Ei at all piques Yae's interest.
Traveler returns to the Plane of Euthymia during the The Omnipresent God, allowing Yae to enter using her connection to the Grand Narukami Shrine Omamori that she gave them beforehand. They show Ei the light of the Visions inlaid in the Statue of the Omnipresent GodBlind Loyalty, Reckless Courage Yae Miko: If you can get the Raiden Shogun to "open her heart" to you once more before the Statue of the Omnipresent God, you will have the opportunity you need... which, combined with her defeat at the Traveler's hands, finally shakes her will and convinces her of the potential within human wills and dreams.
After the Inazuma Archon Quests, Ei turns off many of the Shogun's functions as she deliberates their future course of action in their pursuit of Eternity and declares that the Raiden Shogun is resting. The Traveler and Paimon visit the Shogun to investigate some concerns held by the people of Inazuma, and after receiving less-than-helpful replies from the Shogun, Ei brings them into the Plane of Euthymia. There, the two convince Ei to take a personal tour of Inazuma, leading her to visit Inazuma for the first time in over 400 years.The Lonesome Euthymia Afterwards, Ei starts involving herself more with Inazuma's affairs and assumes control over the Shogun's body more often - which then leads her to conflict with the Shogun, who judges that Ei may have succumbed to erosion.Farewell to the Past

Personality
The Kamisato Clan's housekeeper. A well-known "fixer" in Inazuma.
Thoma is known by Inazumans to be a "helper" - helping everyone out and ensuring that any issues are quickly and peacefully resolved.
The son of an Inazuman father and Mondstadter mother, Thoma shares the traits seen in both nations' peoples; his father placed a great emphasis on loyalty, while being raised in Mondstadt meant that he could easily mingle with most people. He believes that people should happily enjoy a leisurely life and does not particularly care about his reputation, even if people speak ill of him. He originally went to Inazuma to bring his father Dandelion Wine, but after falling overboard, he ended up in Inazuma with no connections and no Mora. Despite the dangers he faced at the time, Thoma was able to make the most of his situation and eventually obtained the Kamisato Clan's trust. He is an efficient worker, resolving all of the Kamisato Clan's issues in a timely order.
He places great loyalty on the Kamisato Clan. Despite his easy-going appearance, he shows no mercy to those who threaten the Kamisato siblings and the Yashiro Commission. He does not use his connections for personal gains.

Official Introduction
Thoma: A protector from afar with a loyal heart
Woof!
What Taroumaru meant was that Thoma is very good at taking care of people and is a very good friend. But you can't just take care of others, you have to take care of yourself too... Wait, what are you laughing at! I was just translating what Taroumaru said!
Thoma, who was born in Mondstadt, now lives in Inazuma, where he is the Kamisato Clan's housekeeper. He's also a well-known "fixer" in Inazuma.
Perhaps influenced by the relaxed and happy atmosphere of his hometown, Thoma is very good at socializing. Although he is an outlander, he has built an unexpectedly powerful network of people in Inazuma.
He is an affable person by nature and can easily get involved in various topics and establish relationships with various people. When it is time to defend the rights and interests of the Yashiro Commission, he will also put his smile away and show his serious side.
Occasionally, however, Thoma will sit alone in a corner of the Yashiro Commission and think about matters concerning himself.
He is an attentive, friendly, and sociable person who cares for all animals and comrades, but perhaps he also feels some unspeakable homesickness.
Version 2.2 Preview Introduction
The Kamisato Clan's housekeeper. A well-known "fixer" in Inazuma.
Thoma's official title in the Kamisato Clan is that of a "housekeeper," and he is responsible for matters such as cooking and cleaning.
Thoma has always employed methods of his own to develop the influence of the Yashiro Commission in certain unknown quarters.
Character Stories
Thoma's official title in the Kamisato Clan is that of a "housekeeper," and as such, he is responsible for matters such as cleaning and cooking.Whenever he appears at the Yashiro Commission, Thoma is almost always busy with such work. He is able to get everything done well, and even Furuta, the butler of the Kamisato Clan, is full of praise for his housekeeping skills.However, most of the time, Thoma does not stay in the Yashiro Commission, but goes elsewhere to deal with some special matters discreetly.For example: solving the problems encountered by the Yashiro Commission, asking for information for the head of the Kamisato Clan, fulfilling Ayaka's wishes, etc.In those unknown corners, Thoma has always used his own way to develop the influence of the Yashiro Commission.
Thoma seems to have been born with a good temper.Regardless of whether he's dealing with a dignitary or a street vendor, Thoma can easily find an opening to join the conversation and have a good time with them.Thoma, who is good at socializing, has a wide range of contacts in Inazuma. When he first arrived in Inazuma, he relied on his insight and communication skills to make friends with people in various industries. Later, many people would take the initiative to get to know Thoma.The more people you know, the more resources you can get. Thoma would learn a lot of first-hand information from them, or quietly strike "deals" that are beneficial to the Yashiro Commission.However, although Thoma has a vast network of contacts, he has never used it for personal gain, nor has he ever forced others to do things in the name of the Yashiro Commission.Sociability, precise judgment, and just the right amount of tact. Perhaps this is the reason why Thoma can thrive as a "fixer" in Inazuma.
Surprisingly, the handsome and cheerful Thoma has no resistance when it comes to cute animals.When Thoma's out, he always carries some small snacks for animals, and feeds stray cats and dogs when he sees them.It never fails to make him smile seeing animals scarf food down.To Thoma, these animals, like himself, are part of what makes up the world.Even if they don't seem to be eye-catching, they are still trying to live.As long as you live, good things will always happen... This is what Thoma has always believed in.Even if these animals had not encountered good things before, he hoped that at least his presence would be a good thing worth celebrating for.
As the housekeeper of the Kamisato Clan, Thoma is an "all-rounder" when it comes to housekeeping.Whether it's cleaning, cooking, sewing, gardening, caregiving, or socializing, he can handle it all with ease.For Thoma, housekeeping is not only a job and duty, but also his hobby.He would clean the house like new, making sure that there was not a single grain of dust left on the railings. He would be in a very happy mood when faced with a clean and tidy Yashiro Commission.Perhaps it's the sense of accomplishment that comes with cleaning. Whenever he has the chance, Thoma will pick up a broom or duster and sweep away any unsightly stains.In addition, he also takes special care of the daily lives of his colleagues around him.There was a winter when Inazuma's temperature suddenly dipped, and a guard of the Yashiro Commission accidentally caught a cold while out on patrol. A few days later, he unexpectedly received a sweater hand-knitted by Thoma.The sweater that was just the right size made the guard think back to the clothes he received from his mother every winter. Now that his mother was old, she hadn't sent him clothes for many years.With this in mind, the guard took a long leave of absence to visit his family. The day he came back, he brought Thoma a special souvenir from his hometown, and they became good friends.
Thoma's father is an Inazuman and his mother is a Mondstadter.Thoma grew up in Mondstadt and has been accustomed to its carefree and happy atmosphere since he was young. Influenced by this, he can easily mingle with anyone.However, he has also been taught by his father since he was a child and places great importance on the word "loyalty".After Thoma's father returned to Inazuma, he was worried that his old man would not be able to drink Mondstadt's wine there, so he sailed to Inazuma alone in a boat carrying Dandelion Wine.On the way, a huge wave overturned the boat and Thoma fell into the water. Fortunately, he just drifted unconscious down the water until he got washed ashore on a beach in Inazuma.At that time, Thoma had nothing and no family with him, but still started his life in Inazuma with optimism.However, despite his best efforts, he was unable to find his father, who was supposed to be in Inazuma.But at his most difficult moment, Thoma met someone in Inazuma who was worthy of his "loyalty" to the end.
Due to his hailing from Mondstadt, Thoma is often regarded as an "outsider" by the local residents of Inazuma.Despite the strange looks and gossip directed towards him, Thoma never showed any dissatisfaction, and always smiled at all doubts.Thoma is recognized as the most amiable person in the Yashiro Commission, but to outsiders, it is another story."Don't offend Thoma! Otherwise, things will be difficult to handle."No one is sure when it started, but this saying has gone around so much that many people are convinced of this when they hear it.As for those who have had unpleasant run-ins with Thoma, the mention of him still instills fear:"Don't be fooled by that guy! He's always smiling kindly, but all I did was cheat the Yashiro Commission of a small sum of money, and he..."That's right, if anyone dares to harm the interests of the Yashiro Commission or disrespect the Kamisato siblings, Thoma will make them pay.He sees this as his duty and does his best, but does not like to boast about his achievements. Even if he is criticized for this, he will not defend himself too much."Gee, who cares about such trivialities? And it doesn't matter what kind of person I am, as long as those who should know know it."
Thoma's favorite duster has been with him in many "conquests".As it has been used for too long, no matter how Thoma cleans and takes care of it now, it still looks old and gray. Despite this, Thoma is still reluctant to discard it.This duster was given to Thoma when he was first assigned cleaning duties at Yashiro Commission. As soon as he sees it, he recalls those hard but happy times.At that time, Thoma had yet to comprehend various cleaning techniques. Due to his lack of experience, he was often busy doing all kinds of cleaning and tidying work until late at night.Accompanying him were the moonlight above his head, the chirping of insects in the summer night, and the sound of a duster tapping on the beams.There are many different kinds of cleaning. From a simple cleaning to an all-out deep cleaning, Thoma has experienced it all.At first, he found the work boring, but after he got used to it, he found that he could think more quietly when cleaning.So to this day, Thoma often uses this duster to perform his work.While brushing away the dust in front of him, he also brushed away the fog in his head in a quiet and steady state of mind.
In his early years living in Mondstadt, Thoma did not have particularly strong aspirations.Each day, he was awakened by the early morning sun and the fresh fragrance of flowers. After breakfast, he could choose to take a relaxing stroll through the city or explore the wilderness freely.At that time, Thoma thought that people should have the happiness of living a leisurely life. Perhaps it would have been better to live a peaceful life.This calm mood disappeared the moment when he was swept into a strange country by the waves, across the ocean in a small boat.Here, he had to receive a favor to survive, and thus the thought of "repayment" arose.Ten years ago, when the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan was losing its power.Kamisato Ayato, who was embroiled in the dispute over the succession rights of the clan due to the death of both parents, told Thoma:"Now that the situation in Inazuma is unclear, the trouble the Kamisato Clan faces will only increase. You are someone who can see what's at stake, so if you don't want to get involved, leave early."Could Thoma, who had received so many favors from the Kamisato Clan, just leave like that? Choosing to leave would mean that he would have to return to his ordinary, stable life with regrets and guilt.The storm was imminent, and Thoma was like a leaf drifting in the sea.But after much deliberation, Thoma's answer was:"If I leave at this time, I will lose my loyalty and righteousness. Father has always taught me to be a loyal and righteous man... I would like to do my best to do my part for the young master and the young lady. You will certainly need me as a helper in the path you embark on in the future."The will to burn for loyalty and righteousness forged a strong desire that drew the attention of the gods.As if to respond to Thoma's choice — on this night of divergent destinies, a Vision, bright red like a blaze, appeared beside him.

<title>Thunder Sakura</title>
<text>Thunder Sakura are large tree-trunks infused with Electro. There are five of them across Kannazuka. When the player gets close to one, they will target the player with deadly lightning bolts, dealing AoE Electro DMG. During the World Quest 'Sakura Arborism', the player is tasked with healing the trees in Kannazuka. After a tree is healed, it will be inert and no longer attack the player with lightning.
There are also five Thunder Sakura roots located throughout Narukami Island, which the Traveler purifies during the World Quest series 'Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual'.
Overview
The Thunder Sakura are believed to symbolize the Electro Archon's eternal watch over Inazuma and purify evil by absorbing filth from the land. The Thunder Sakura are side branches of the Sacred Sakura, so the filth accumulated in a Thunder Sakura will spread up the roots and to the central roots of the Sacred Sakura beneath Mt. Yougou. If too much filth accumulates, the roots will begin to corrode and form tumors, thus it is necessary to routinely perform a Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual Lore Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual to purify the filth from the roots.Sacrificial OfferingSacred Sakura Cleansing Summary
The Thunder Sakura are either guarding or suppressing something located under the trees, which is why the Grand Narukami Shrine grew concerned over their condition and Miyuki was dispatched to investigate.Sakura ArborismIn 'Sakura Arborism', Miyuki remarks that the Thunder Sakura "serve to suppress the one who lies beneath." The equivalent Chinese line says mini=1 zh=毕竟树下还镇守着那位大人的… zh_tl=After all, these trees are still guarding what lies beneath, that Great One's..., where mini=1 zh=大人 zh_rm=dàrén is a respectful term of address for someone of high rank and mini=1 zh=的 zh_rm=de indicates that whatever Miyuki left unsaid somehow relates back to this person. The phrase translated as "to suppress" is mini=1 zh=鎮守 zh_tl=to guard, which is translated as "guard" or "defender" in other parts of the game; "suppress" and "seal" are typically used to translate the words mini=1 zh=壓制 zh_tl=to repress or mini=1 zh=鎮壓 zh_tl=to suppress. However, there is too little information to determine whether the English interpretation is necessarily incorrect, as Miyuki's line was left unfinished.

<title>Sojourner</title>
<text>The songs are spent like arrows few, to the choir the curtain calls. Shall I ever see you smile anew, when the tower in the city square falls?
The sojourner '(unofficial name)'"Sojourner" is derived from the Artifact Set 'Resolution of Sojourner', which revolves around his story. In Artifact and Weapon descriptions, he is typically referred to as the "traveler," the "lyrist," or the "harpist." was a historical figure from Fontaine who lived a thousand years ago. He was a member of the Wanderer's Troupe (Faction) Wanderer's Troupe, a group of warrior–musicians who led a failed uprising against the oppressive Mondstadt Aristocracy, and was the original wielder of The Stringless, before the aristocracy cut the bow's strings to keep it from playing music.The Stringless
Profile
The sojourner came from the nation of Fontaine, where he led a life of great privilege and was much beloved by the ladies of the Court of Fontaine. When he left unannounced to pursue a wandering, unburdened life and seek his destiny, the women of the Court wept at the news.Resolution of Sojourner
At some point in time, he met the Conductor. The Dawnlight Swordswoman joined them, followed by Kreuzlied, a defector from the Lawrence Clan. Together, they created the Wanderer's Troupe. They journeyed throughout Teyvat, including dangerous areas such as Mare Jivari, before finally arriving in Mondstadt.Wanderer's Troupe There, the sojourner fell in love with a young woman; however, she had been chosen as the Ludi Harpastum maiden - the one who would be claimed against her will by a member of the Lawrence Clan.By the time of the Manga Prologue, the Lawrence Clan's practice of laying claim to the girl who threw the Harpastum appears to have been going on for some time. While the girl depicted in the manga is unlikely to be the same woman the sojourner fell in love with, they presumably shared the same fate. After learning about the aristocracy's tyranny, the Wanderer's Troupe attempted to storm the City of Mondstadt and overthrow them.The Widsith Lore They were repelled, however, and most of its members were either slain in battle or captured and enslaved. The sojourner himself perished during the fight, trying to cover his allies' retreat.

<title>Chouji's Mother</title>
<text>Chouji's mother is an unnamed woman identified only through her relation to Chouji. She originally lived in Higi Village with her son and husband. After the Tatarigami outbreak, she departed for Sumeru to seek a cure for her mysterious condition and to find her missing husband.Gazing Three Thousand Miles AwayWashizu's Prayers
Profile
Chouji's mother originally lived with her son and husband in a village near Jakotsu Mine, where her husband was a miner. She worked at Tatarasuna,Chouji's Travels although her job there has not been disclosed. While they lived together, Chouji's mother taught him how to cook various dishes, including Imported Poultry which they had learned to make from the Fontaine inventor Xavier.
Chouji's father disappeared in the chaos of the war between the Shogun's Army and the Watatsumi Army, while both sides plastered recruitment posters on the wall in front of their home. Chouji's mother often visited local shrines to pray, scattering Sakura Blooms around the shrines as an offering.Tattered Paper (Washizu)Shrines of Yashiori Island When Chouji's father failed to return home, villagers erected a tombstone for him, much to her anger; Chouji remarks that he had never seen her so angry before.
During the war, the Narukami Pillars on Yashiori Island were destroyed by rogue members of the Watatsumi Army, unleashing the full might of the Tatarigami. The situation on Yashiori Island rapidly deteriorated as villagers and soldiers alike descended into madness,Tatarigami Investigation Expedition and Chouji's mother was attacked by a villager named Shingo, who believed he was hearing the word of god. Additionally, Chouji's mother was infected by the Tatarigami, but its energies did not corrupt her like it did others, instead flowing freely inside her. However, she was still inflicted with a fever and occasional bleeding, so the doctor Yasumoto referred her to some pirates led by Onitaka to bring her to Sumeru in search for treatment for her condition.Pharmacist's Notebook (II)Interactable: Pirate's Diary Incomplete Notes Incomplete Notes on Nazuchi Beach
Ten days after the rain caused by the Tatarigami started to fall on Yashiori Island, Chouji's mother left the island for Sumeru. She wrote the Unsealed Letter to Chouji to apologize for her abrupt departure, but the letter somehow ended up hidden away in Jakotsu Mine and never reached Chouji. The letter was opened by an unidentified person before the Traveler chances upon it.Unsealed Letter
Meanwhile, Washizu, the village's head, was driven insane by the Tatarigami. Like Shingo before him, Washizu set his sights on Chouji's mother because "He" was pleased with her. Her departure for Sumeru enraged him, and he rants to the Traveler about how she could not escape from "His" thousands of eyes.Sinister Instruction</text>

Character Stories
A pair of siblings have inherited the Kamisato Clan, one of the three most respected and prestigious clans in Inazuma City.The elder brother, Kamisato Ayato Ayato, is the head of the clan and is in charge of government affairs.While his younger sister, Ayaka, known by all as the Princess, takes care of the clan's internal and external affairs.Ayaka often appears at social occasions and has more interactions with the common folk. As such, she is better known by the people and has gained a higher reputation than her elder brother.This has earned her the elegant title of Shirasagi Himegimi.As is known to all,Ayaka, the daughter of the Kamisato family, is a figure greatly admired by the people for her beauty, dignified demeanor, and noble character.
Across Inazuma, all affairs of state that do not go up to the Raiden Shogun are largely handled by the Triarchal Council.The Council's executive powers are, in turn, divided amongst three groups known as the Tri-Commission: the Yashiro Commission, the Tenryou Commission, and the Kanjou Commission.The three clans that hold power over these Commissions are as follows: Kamisato, Kujou Clan Kujou, and Hiiragi Clan Hiiragi. These three great clans are known throughout Inazuma.Kamisato Ayaka is the young lady of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan, known far and wide as the Shirasagi Himegimi.When asked the whys and wherefores of such a nickname, many Inazumans have their own explanations..."Lady Ayaka is as graceful and pure as an egret. And just look at her elegance, her clever yet proper speech - why should she not be named a Princess?""Lady Ayaka may be of noble birth, but she is gentle and polite to us. She is kind, loyal, and is willing to help others. She even went against the opinions of others and took in that commoner, Thoma."There are as many opinions concerning this as there are people, but none can say where the "Shirasagi Himegimi" nickname actually originated.Still, Ayaka's popularity amongst the people is quite plain to see.
As the daughter of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan, Ayaka always has to remain alert to the jostling for power between noble families.Being young, yet already famed throughout the land, she has been the inevitable target of provocation on the part of other noble scions who have grown jealous of the Kamisato siblings.The creation and maintenance of a public image may be a formality, but for a house of standing like the Kamisato Clan, even meaningless routine has social significance.Failing to take part in the tangled web of Inazuman political relations risks their position as head of the Yashiro Commission. As such, the two siblings came to an accord.The elder brother, Ayato, preferring not to show his face too often, would busy himself with government affairs, while the act of maintaining the clan's image would be the responsibility of the elegant, socially-adroit younger sister, Ayaka.Through her dignified, demure and polite posture, Ayaka has very much secured a place for herself in the social arena. Whether she is negotiating with potential partners or dealing with difficult nobles, her actions are all well-founded and beyond reproach.The internal clan affairs are also in her care. Indeed, their estates may have descended into chaos already, if not for her.
One autumn afternoon, Ayaka was on her way home from completing certain minor affairs when she happened to hear an old voice singing from within an old house.Within was an old woman, blind in both eyes, whose stick-thin fingers produced music like flowing water as they plucked at her instrument's strings.Perhaps it was due to her sharp ears, but the old lady heard Ayaka's footsteps and inquired as to who was outside. Not wishing to trouble the old lady, Ayaka replied that she was a nearby resident who had gotten lost and entered this place.As a member of the Yashiro Commission, Ayaka was well-acquainted with the peoples' lives and quickly recognized this solitary old lady as the very same person who busked in the city streets when the weather was good.The tune was outdated, and so was the song. As one who could not see, this lady had long fallen out of step with the times. Even in the nation that pursues eternity, some still endured such hard lives.Out of the goodness of her heart, Ayaka, thusly incognito, spent a long time chatting with the old lady. Taking Ayaka for an ordinary maiden, the old lady spoke of the method of making and playing the koto, and even gave her some tea leaves that she had kept stored up.Compared to the exquisite leaves that the Kamisato Clan had in stock, these rough leaves may as well have been grass, but Ayaka accepted them while profusely thanking her.That day, she thought of her parents many times. Had they been around, would they not have grown this old someday?Returning home, she spoke of her encounter with her brother, and the two siblings shared the rustic tea gifted to her by the old lady.Afterward, Ayaka would come to see that old lady again every few days, each time posing as a person living nearby, and each time bringing with her some daily necessities that were well-loved by the common folk."The sakura trees in the streets have bloomed again," Ayaka said to the old lady with a smile, "and they are as lovely as your music."
In people's imagination, the nobility's living expenses are orders of magnitude above the common folk. So for someone as noble as Kamisato Ayaka, surely she too must lead a life of wanton luxury.This statement is only half right, however.Ayaka does ostensibly live in a much more particular manner than the ordinary citizen.The costs of studying flower arrangement and tea ceremony, sampling fine teas, and enjoying exotic flowers daily are also by no means small. However, these are all skills that she must master as a young lady of a noble house - such commitments can hardly be called "wanton."The things that can truly make Ayaka smile are, in fact, ordinary things that even the common folk can enjoy.The making of snacks, fishing for goldfish by the ponds, squirreling herself away to read the latest novels from Yae Publishing House... Each one of these is but a tiny matter.At such times, she is not the adored Shirasagi Himegimi, or Lady Ayaka, mistress of the great Kamisato estates. She is just "Ayaka," an ordinary girl like any other.Here, she sets her dignified externalized persona aside and sets her true, casual self free. Only as "Ayaka" can she lay down her heavy burdens and do the things that ordinary girls can do.When hungry at night, she sneaks past the servants into the kitchen and makes herself some chazuke while humming a little tune. During tea ceremony classes, she might surreptitiously try to use the tea leaves to indulge in some romance-related astrology... The list of her little escapades goes on.Though she has never told anyone this, Ayaka treasures her time as an ordinary girl above all else, for these moments of freedom are things she rarely ever has.
The tutors who guide Ayaka in her various arts once used to say: whether in tea ceremony, chess, the art of the sword, or all other affairs of elegance, Ayaka is already a master.She is clearly already a noble lady of superb bearing, skilled with both the pen and the sword. To be able to teach such a pupil is a teacher's pride and joy.Still, Ayaka thinks quietly to herself, does she truly have no regrets?The essence of tea is peace and quiet.The heart of the sword is the keenest edge.The soul of chess is the wisdom to grasp the bigger picture.These three she has grasped indeed, and the spirit of true friendship also.And yet, Ayaka is still waiting for a friend to emerge who can walk alongside her on equal footing and stand by her side.That person cannot see her as a member of the Yashiro Commission, or as the Shirasagi Himegimi, nor will their conduct towards her be bound by decorum or status. And if possible, they might also be well-versed in a great many fields of study, and have witnessed all manner of interesting things... and perhaps they might even be able to tell her a story in a pinch.Only such a person might become Ayaka's bosom friend."Surely, this is not too much to ask... But where might I find such a person?"
"Come, come, come,""Let's play Temari!""1, 2, 1, 2, 3,""The Temari goes up the Sacred Sakura Tree.""4, 5, 4, 5, 6,""Woosh, and over Mt. Yougou it flicks!""7, 8, 7, 8, 9,""The Temari returns into these hands of mine.""Yes, into little~ Ayaka's~ hands~!"This was Ayaka's favorite nursery rhyme back in the day.Back then, she gave her favorite Temari the name "Moriwakamaru," and she would dribble the multi-colored Moriwakamaru about while humming this very song.Hearing her song, her parents and brother would be unable to stop themselves from smiling. Indeed, they would often join in the fun, tossing the Temari between them as a family.But that was a long time ago, and Ayaka no longer plays games of Temari.She has become an independent, powerful figure in her own right - and Moriwakamaru, the symbol of her childhood and the bearer of her precious memories, has also been stored away within Ayaka's cabinet.
Some years ago, the Clan underwent a huge change, and a heavy burden fell upon Ayato's shoulders. At that time, Ayaka was not yet the mature and capable person she is now.She was originally a playful child, one who knew nothing of the clan's duties, and thus lacked the skill and experience needed for dealing with various kinds of people altogether.But seeing her mother on her sickbed and her brother hard at work, Ayaka sensed that she too had to grow up.So she decided to take up her long-disused sword arts and poetry, both staples of nobility. If she could master these two, she could at least pass for a decent lady of the Kamisato Clan, and thus help her brother show up at some festivals, alleviating his burden.Truth be told, Ayaka was not preternaturally gifted and would spend much time being troubled by her inability to memorize poetry, write elegantly, or brandish her sword.Yet she did not waver - a poem she failed to memorize once would be memorized fifty times, a poorly-written word would be written fifty times over, and a sword technique that failed would be swung fifty times more."None may deflect a swing that has been practiced a thousand times." - This was something her mother told her.When her mother left this world, Ayaka was no longer "Little Ayaka." She was now Kamisato Ayaka, the young lady of the Kamisato Clan, one of the Shogun's three great clans.Sword art training thus became part of her daily life and has remained so to this day without pause.On one particular day, Ayaka, at last, defeated an opponent in a single strike. In that instant, as she stood in the middle of the dojo, icy flowers condensed all about her. And there, upon the tip of her sword, now hung a Vision, icy and bright."None may deflect a swing that has been practiced a thousand times" indeed - and even the gods may thus be moved.

<title>Yanfei/Lore</title>
<text>A half-illuminated beast and highly-skilled legal adviser.She combines adherence to the legal codices and reasonable flexibility to find the perfect balance in her work. She devotes herself to protecting the fairness of contracts in Liyue with her identity as a legal adviser and her unique experience and methods.
Personality
A well-known legal adviser active in Liyue Harbor. A brilliant young lady in whose veins runs the blood of an illuminated beast.
Yanfei enjoys appraisal, reading and is very knowledgeable on many topics - most notably the law, due to her career as a legal advisor. With a strong sense of justice, Yanfei does not mind traveling to help her clients should they have trouble in different parts of Liyue. She claims to have extensive knowledge of the laws of the other nations in Teyvat - though, she notes Fontaine's law to be the most difficult. She is well known by the people of Liyue for her knowledge and is considered the premier legal advisor of Liyue, a title that garners her many a client across the nation. Even Ningguang, the Tianquan of the Liyue Qixing, states that Yanfei's memorization of the law allows her to quickly close loopholes in existing laws faster than she would have been able to herself. When resolving disputes, Yanfei always gets all legal evidence beforehand to make a compelling and convincing argument. Although she can handle any case, she dislikes having to deal with civil suits. As many in Liyue do, Yanfei places a high value on the importance of contracts, though she is noted to place a higher value on them more than the average person due to the nature of her job.
Despite having the blood of an adeptus in her veins, Yanfei is not particularly concerned about her adeptal heritage and is one of the few who did not sign a contract with Rex Lapis due to being born in an era of peace. It is not through any adepti powers or abilities that she may have that she endeavors to make life in Liyue better, but through her profession. She is very active and often talks a lot, a stark contrast to her adeptus father, whom Madame Ping states to be more solemn. She spends her time much like an average human does, and unlike most adepti, Yanfei doesn't consider herself above mortals in any way.
Despite her playful nature, Yanfei takes her job seriously and practically, ensuring she and all involved parties of a case are well accounted for. She is also willing to do 'pro bono' work as long as she isn't required to be deeply involved. Yanfei dreams of a day where people live honest and happy lives, and there is no longer a need for legal advisors. Should such a day ever come, Yanfei's backup plan is to become a rapper.
Yanfei enjoys tofu because of its versatility and availability. She dislikes cold food and she rarely eats them since her father told her that food was best served hot.
Appearance
Golden Rule
Yanfei uses the Medium Female Characters medium female model. She has a pale complexion, bright teal-green eyes with ovoid pupils, and salmon-colored hair that goes past her shoulders and fades to a pale peach at the tips. The hair around the sides of her head is chopped short at ear length in a fringe, revealing a pair of cream colored antlers as a result of her xiezhiSoundtrack: Marching of Xiezhi heritage. In addition to this, the sides of her chest, ankles, and the backs of her hands have white diamond-shaped markings that resemble scales.
Official Introduction
Yanfei:Do not seek to emulate the past, for there is no law that can suffice for all time.
Law is the cornerstone of Liyue's prosperity. This cornerstone needs to be continuously polished to pursue perfection. I have had many dealings with Yanfei in legal affairs, and I must give her credit for helping me uncover quite a number of flaws in our system of laws.
Yanfei is Liyue Harbor's top legal adviser. They say that she has memorized tens of thousands of legal codices and can skillfully apply the law in various situations. One can rest assured that she will aptly handle any legal case brought to her.
But this is not to say that Yanfei adheres blindly to the legal codices. Rather, she employs a degree of flexibility within the limits of the law and reason.
This half-illuminated beast protects the order of Liyue in her unique, effective manner.
All of Liyue's residents have heard of the famed Yanfei, no matter who you ask. Of course, as is the ancient rule in the City of Contracts, one seeking legal consultation or services from Yanfei must prepare a rather hefty sum as payment.
Character Stories
Liyue is a port that prizes contracts and trade, and it is a place where wealth accumulates.Merchants from various nations are active here, which has contributed to Liyue's abundance, but has also brought up many disagreements. The Tianquan, Ningguang, has written a very comprehensive compendium of laws to deal with this, but not everyone has the patience to study them.Thus was born the role of the legal adviser in Liyue society. Highly familiar with Liyue's laws, they help those in need to navigate any contradictions, earning recompense for their efforts.Yanfei is the premier legal adviser in Liyue Harbor.She is always able to obtain the most benefits for her clients, insofar as the law will allow. Some even call her "the law that walks."But in truth, what Yanfei - one of the few Adepti half-illuminated-beasts who have yet to sign a contract with Rex Lapis - really wants to do is live a free and happy life.As for the copy of "The General Law of Liyue" that she carries around on her person, Yanfei has this to say:"If you don't wish to be bound by the rules, you have to first understand them all."
As the most sought-after legal adviser in Liyue Harbor, Yanfei's rates are also top-of-the-line.Even so, she never lacks for people coming to seek appointments. After all, merchants are not stingy about mediation fees, but are very picky indeed about the mediator."Money is no object - we must have Yanfei come and settle this matter for us."Many rate Yanfei in this fashion, not only for her quick-thinking or her masterful oratory, but also because she very greatly emphasizes the cornerstone of the law - "fairness."Her mediations often end in win-win situations, and even merchants with daggers drawn will temporarily set their prejudices aside.Though she is unbound by a contract, Yanfei has made her own contribution to the peace and prosperity of Liyue.
As a legal adviser, Yanfei does have her fair share of weaknesses. An example is the mediation of civil disputes that involve emotions and relationships.Divorces, inheritances, custody disputes, senior care, severances... The list continues.It is said that upright officials are hapless in household affairs, and so it also is with Yanfei, who grew up surrounded by love - these matters fall right into her blind corner.Sometimes, she will find that both sides have reason on their side, and other times she will find them to both be unreasonable. Child custody disputes are the absolute worst, as no matter how she settles them, the settlement will have a great psychological impact on the innocent children. Even if Yanfei chooses to soldier on, she will only tire herself out."Hopefully, everyone can meet the right person and be spared this particular grief."
As a result of her greatly tolerant nature, Yanfei has a wide variety of personal relationships throughout Liyue.There is no need to worry about rubbing a sore spot, and you'll be able to get along with her whether you're an avid conversationalist or not.Of course, this is true as long as you don't attempt to debate with her or start a conversation about the legal profession... Yanfei in work mode is a completely different beast to deal with.Additionally, Yanfei has cultivated the habit of being overly rigorous from her long years of studying the law. When chatting, Yanfei will vigorously eliminate any ambiguity or loopholes present in the discourse and can seem like a bit of a chatterbox. When she realizes this, Yanfei is wont to knock herself on the head with a book in irritation.However, so long as she constantly bathes in a sea of legal literature, this habit will probably be quite hard to break.
When investigating the law, Yanfei's habit is to look past the cold letters of the law to perceive their point of origin.As such, she is also something of a master of "reading comprehension" in her relationships.Once, the Traveler met Yanfei by chance and said, "Huh. Didn't expect to see you here."This should have been a line that one might hear just about anywhere, but it wound up holding a completely different meaning for Yanfei."Didn't expect to meet you here" implied that the Traveler had at least thought about a scenario in which they would meet. Then why the use of "didn't expect"? One could only postulate that the Traveler had some expectation of where she might appear, and that her current location was not such a place. But whence came the expectation? Could it be that the Traveler had always been paying attention to her in secret?"Does this mean that the Traveler...?"Yanfei tossed and turned in bed that night, unable to sleep.
Yanfei's most prized possession is the steelyard balance that her father gave her.It is said that this balance was a treasure given by Rex Lapis that can be used to measure the value of all things. For convenience, Yanfei tends to use Mora to balance the scales, which is to say that she uses Mora to evaluate objects.The prices of many objects have slowly changed over the years, but weighing an object with this balance only gives its value at the time Mora was created, leaving the rest to Yanfei to exercise her own wisdom and judgment.Across the measurements of countless objects, Yanfei is able to see the changes in Liyue. Some objects that were once common have become vanishingly rare, and some exotic objects of the past have been rendered pedestrian today.This steelyard balance reminds her that many things cannot be valued by the standards of the world.Yanfei once tried to weigh the value of a Vision, but no matter how much Mora she added, the scales would not be balanced.In frustration, she placed on the scale the box at her waist, which contained her heavy, handwritten legal notations. Only then did the weights at last even out.
This is the most special of the many legal treatises that Yanfei collects.As opposed to the codices that grow heavier and more complicated with time, this book is unbelievably light and thin.After opening it and getting past the prologue, one will find naught but the most basic few principles of the law inscribed.As Yanfei sees it, this is the final form of the law. In the far future, the law will have entered into the people's hearts. All people will be amiable, modest, and live happily in this world. The halls of judgment will lie empty and the mountains of legalese shall be caked in years of dust.Though this may sound like something very far off, for someone like Yanfei, in whom flows the blood of an illuminated beast, living till that day is hardly a great accomplishment."Hmm, but if I think about it more deeply, I'd be out of a job then, wouldn't I?"After encountering one of Xinyan's performances by chance, Yanfei was quite taken by this new wave of performance art.That said, learning an instrument from scratch proved to be a bit difficult, so after consulting a great many resources, Yanfei came to what she considered to be a decent backup plan.If such a day were to arrive, she would just become a rapper.For someone who can recite tens of thousands of words' worth of Liyue law from front to back within an hour, speed at least should be no challenge.
Yanfei's father is an illuminated beast, while her mother is an ordinary mortal merchant. Born into peaceful times, Yanfei did not sign a contract with Rex Lapis, but instead has one with her parents to "live happily."As Liyue's leading legal exegete, she is no stranger to exploiting some existing loopholes in the law - at times for herself, and sometimes for others.It has been made clear often enough that Yanfei is not a stickler for the rules and has no wish to be shackled by strictures.Still, she contributes to the betterment of Liyue as she seeks her own pleasure, and will not use these loopholes for ill.When making amendments to legal loopholes each year, Ningguang the Tianquan will often study Yanfei's doings, as if she were Liyue's unofficial legal troubleshooter.In a sense, one could argue that Yanfei makes the laws better at the lowest possible price... This principle is also the reason why she has never been convicted of exploiting any such loopholes.Yanfei believes in "no structure without laws," and what she wishes for is to "live as one pleases without overstepping."Everyone in Liyue, adeptus or mortal, protects it in their own way.That is why Yanfei possesses a Vision, one that is of equal weight to her principles.

<title>Pir Kavikavus</title>
<text>Pir Kavikavus was a historical figure in Sumeru. He was hailed as a true genius and the pride of Kshahrewar; however, following an accident during his research into the Ruin Golem (Devantaka Mountain) Ruin Golem at Devantaka Mountain, his research was lost and Kshahrewar lost its prestige ever since.
Story
It has been proven that Akasha System Akasha has no signal on Devantaka Mountain.|Pir Kavikavus
An unknown amount of time after the cataclysm 500 years ago, Pir Kavikavus joined Sumeru Akademiya's Kshahrewar. He proved to be a prodigy and gained the status of Herbad before he was 30 years old, which was a monumental accomplishment.Vimana Agama: Jazari's Chapter Kavikavus was also friends with an Aranara named Aralohita, who accompanied him and helped him with his discoveries.Until Vana is Healed
In the Akademiya's records, he was the last person to get inside the Ruin Golem for systematic research and since then, nobody has been able to make their way inside. However, while he was investigating the ancient Khaenri'ahn construct, he got into an accident. His research was lost and Pir Kavikavus himself likely died. Ever since then, Kshahrewar has been greatly depreciated in the Akademiya's eyes, and they have not even received an increase in funding in the years since his passing.Akademiya Public Message Board Funding for Kshahrewar
After Kavikavus' death, Aralohita saved some of his research and locked it behind riddles and puzzles, which the Aranara had been fond of. While Aralohita survived whatever accident Kavikavus was involved in, Aralohita's own fate is unknown.
Legacy
Many members of Kshahrewar continue to admire Kavikavus to this day, including Jazari, who seeks to follow in his predecessor's path and study the Ruin Golem. While helping Ararycan protect the forest, the Traveler and Paimon aid Jazari's research for their own ends.
After solving a puzzle Aralohita left behind, the Traveler, Paimon, and Ararycan discovered one of Kavikavus' writings, entitled "Theory and Practice: Enhancing the Safety of the Chaos Core in Unstable Conditions Using the Khaenri'ah Ruin Golem of Devantaka Mountain as an Example." Unable to read it themselves, they gave it to Jazari, who was able to understand what Kavikavus had written about.
Ecstatic over the discovery of Kavikavus' long-lost research, Jazari immediately put it to the test by sealing the Ruin Golem's Chaos Core. The seal successfully weakened the Abyss Mages who tried to interrupt the sealing process, and with the seal complete, the Abyss Order's threat to the forest was greatly diminished.</text>

<title>Dehya/Lore</title>
<text>A member of "The Eremites," a loosely-organized mercenary organization. She is brave, powerful, and enjoys an excellent reputation among mercenaries.
Personality
A member of the Eremites, a mercenary organization that roams the sands of Sumeru. Valiant and powerful, she enjoys great fame amongst her fellow Eremites.
As with all Eremites, Dehya enjoys training and sparring whenever she gets the chance. She gets along well with Dunyarzad and respects her determination, wanting to help her in any way possible, albeit slightly embarrassed publicly admit it; when Dunyarzad tried to revive the Sabzeruz Festival, Dehya secretly sold her claymore and anonymously donated the Mora to help out. While not a follower of the gods, Dehya does respect Lesser Lord Kusanali, due to seeing how much of an impact she made in Dunyarzad's life.
Appearance
The Lioness and the Blazing Sun
Dehya uses the Tall Female Characters tall female model. She has lightly tanned skin, sky-blue eyes with yellow 'cat-eye' pupils, and dusky blonde-accented dark brown hair.
Official Introduction
Dehya: The eyes of a vulture, the spirit of a lion, an unbridled daughter of the desert
"Sing a song, sing along, take your sitar, let's sing all day long.""Sing my sword, sing my bow, sing my tattered ban-dan-oh.""Fear no one, fear no lad, only fear if Dehya is mad.""We love Dehya, she's beautiful and strong. Oh, our precious Dehya, we'll never do you wrong."
"The Eremites," a loosely-organized mercenary organization, is Sumeru's most powerful armed force. They consist of many mercenaries and bands of warriors-for-hire who carry out assignments independently.
One such brigade is the "Blazing Beasts," whose most renowned member is Dehya, also known as the "Flame-Mane."
A highly regarded warrior among the mercenary circles, Dehya is brave without being impulsive, and strong without being arrogant. Life in the harsh desert environment has allowed Dehya to accumulate much combat wisdom through various battles, and she is by no means your typical insolent and ignorant martial artist.
As long as the pay is good and the commission reasonable, Dehya is more than willing to take up her sword to defend those who hire her.
However, there is one thing these employers should be aware of. That is, the agreement they establish with Dehya is only temporary and purely transactional. The reins to tame this lioness is never, and will never be in their hands.
Although mercenaries sell their strength to make a living, their dignity and lives belong only to themselves.
The desert lioness is no one's slave, and her sword only follows her heart.
Character Stories
The term "Eremites" does not reference a specific group or organization, but all those who are born of the desert and ply a trade using their martial prowess, operating as mercenaries.Frail is humanity in such a desolate profession. To survive, those who walk the path of a mercenary will naturally come together, forming loose bands of mercenaries.Though the Eremites are many, few among them will be remembered as legends, with most bound to be as evanescent as sand in the wind. Yet there are exceptions who, like Dehya, may linger in the annals of history.The "Flame-Mane" Dehya is fierce and brave, the lion her moniker invokes an analogy for her might. The nickname itself, meanwhile, denotes her passionate nature.Should you be planning to hire a mercenary to serve as a bodyguard, Dehya stands as a prime choice. Procuring her service runs an expensive premium, but her abilities make that a worthy expenditure indeed.Compared to those overconfident fools hawking their talents as hired blades on the street and novices capable of little more than brute force, Dehya is a conscientious professional.With all this said, those who wish to procure her services should make haste, for there is a long line of other potential clients that have need of the Flame-Mane, and the opportunity, just as grains in the desert, will slip away before long.
All desertfolk, including Dehya, learn to master and comprehend the sands.Here, where the blue of the sky is boundless, where the gold-paved waves of the sands bleed into the cleft of the horizon, it is easy to feel how small one truly is.Even those familiar with the sights and scenes of the desert can be intermittently shaken by the forces wielded by nature, and find themselves yearning to profess their supplication upon the sands where they were born.The feeble and meek fear this land, and only those strong of spirit can find themselves drifting free upon this golden ocean.Amongst the desertfolk, the bravest, most inured to the cruelties of their existence amidst the flowing sands are the mercenaries - The Eremites.Such a life is one with little comfort or ease, so what a mercenary truly desires are those who can support them, with such covenant-kin being the equal of blood relatives.In her youth, Dehya's family consisted of her father and his mercenaries.As she grew to independence, her new family was the "Blazing Beasts," fellow mercenaries she could trust and count on.After battling together for a time, a tacit understanding forms between individuals, with entire thoughts conveyed with but a movement, a gaze.Later, as she temporarily bid the desert farewell to commit to a commission in the rainforest, she often found herself reminiscing about the moments she spent with her companions, singing by the fireside.She can rise as high as the sky or stray as far as the sea, but Dehya was and will always be a daughter of the sands.
Before one makes any individual comparisons, broadly speaking, females are slightly edged out by males in raw physicality.Dehya, likewise, was not born with immense might. Even so, the other mercenaries have a great many reasons to hold her in high regard.Firstly, though she is not the strongest in her profession, she has force enough all the same.Should one doubt this, they merely need to test the weight of her blade. To make such a greatsword dance and flow without sufficient strength would be impossible otherwise.Secondly, she has tremendous combat instincts. It is known that the greatsword, Dehya's weapon of choice, demands a trade-off between force and speed. Should such a weapon fail to achieve a decisive first strike against a sufficiently mobile foe, it will prove more burden than a boon for the wielder. In moments like these, Dehya uses her superior insight and technique to overcome the opposition.Sometimes, she will cast her weapon aside, eschewing the edge of a sword for the weight behind her fists. She will even hurl her weapon at foes without warning to buy a fleeting opportunity. How any such moment plays out all depends on the actual conditions presented by each battle.Aside being good in a fight, she also knows plenty about surviving in the desert.The commissions that the Eremites most often take will have them serving as bodyguards against raiders without outside support, herding away dangerous creatures, and assisting their clients in avoiding dreaded weather conditions.Sometimes, they even find assignments that have them acting as guides, helping caravans, adventurers, and researchers reach their desired destinations.Dehya knows how to deal with startled scorpion swarms, how to circle around vultures to avoid getting entangled with those nimble annoyances, and how to negotiate and minimize danger when faced with robbers.Clients like it when matters are handled thoroughly and practically. To earn true praise from their employers, mercenaries must offer more than just brute capacity for violence.Indeed, the ability to overcome one hundred or even a thousand foes has its limits, for when sandstorms scour the earth and sky, even the mightiest warrior will be buried beneath its shroud.A wise mercenary knows when to retreat, and how to preserve themselves even while meeting their objectives, for doing so exemplifies the true heights of strategy.
As Dehya's reputation gradually grew amongst the Eremites, those of her band grew proud of the fame she was earning and, during a day when everyone happened to be present, the rowdiest of her companions stated their desire to grant her a nickname worth remembering.Everyone agreed that they would announce Dehya with the new nickname whenever she won future battles, so it needed to be something spectacular - capable of spreading goosebumps through people like a skin-raising plague.The youngest members gave their all trying to come up with something. They chittered and clamored, trying to give Dehya a vicious moniker capable of instilling debilitating terror in potential clients, usually beginning with "bloody" or "terror."Dehya was not such an amateur as to think that a title alone might encapsulate the entirety of what others felt about her. But still, as if everyone wanted to kill some time on this matter, she didn't mind.As she listened to bad suggestion after terrible suggestion, she couldn't help but guffaw with laughter. The atmosphere reminded her of moments from her childhood when Kusayla her father gathered his compatriots to put on plays for her, detailing chivalrous heroes defending the helpless or messy brawls between siblings to amuse everyone. There was no specific point to it, except to bring some cheer while surviving in the vast emptiness under the desert's midnight sky.And just as the chatting was starting to put her in a good mood, that old ne'er-do-well's shadow slid back into her mind. Though admittedly disgruntled, Dehya did her best to keep the curl of her lips imperceptible.That night, Dehya rejected several laughable names, such as the "Sovereign of the Sands" and "The Crimson Edge." She thought it was time to let the farce come to a close. It was just a name after all, and true mercenaries did not let such things affect their business much.Just then, an aged mercenary interrupted the discussion. At first, he snorted disdainfully at the stupidity of those around him. Then, he asked a question: "The Legend of the Lion. This story ring a bell for anyone?"This tale was, naturally, one Dehya was familiar with. During her childhood, her father had told her lots of old stories - far too many, really. She had wanted to forget everything that had to do with him, but memories are not so easily consigned to oblivion.While she was lost in the twists and turns of her past, her companions decided upon a title for her that actually sounded quite alright: "Flame-Mane."And though she loathed the man The Legend of the Lion reminded her of, she found herself halted just before she could reject the name. Was it not all too petty to refuse such goodwill on that account?Must she avoid all the things related to her father, just because she wanted to forget him? Of course not. Besides, the story had brought a genuine feeling of warmth and comfort to Dehya, allowing her to face the world with open eyes, experience all it had to offer - and those experiences had not been falsehoods.So why not take up the title of "Flame-Mane?" She could have done far worse.
Dehya is an individual of immense beauty, a fact undeniable to all who know her.She is blessed with eyes of frosted sapphire capable of shivering souls, honeyed skin that bears a nigh-resplendent gleam when greeted by sunlight, and a length of wavy, black-and-gold hair that drifts behind her with every light-footed step she takes.The desertfolk hold maidens imbued with attractiveness and vigor in great esteem, seeing them as embodiments of vitality.Dehya, likewise, pays a great deal of attention to her looks. When she finds the opportunity, should her environment allow it, she always seizes the chance to take a shower and part her person from the stench of sweat. During her leisure time, she hits up the market for personal care products, procuring powder for her eyes and face alongside other cosmetics for times when she might need them. With how she uses these consumables daily, she often finds her supply depleting rapidly.Mercenaries are typically a crude bunch, accustomed to violence with little focus placed on how they present themselves, making Dehya something of an oddity in that regard. Unable to understand why she is so concerned about her appearance, some of her companions have asked her as much.Well, what else could it be? The men of the desert smell so foul - a stench only made worse when they kick off their boots - that the nausea that follows is near-debilitating.Coated with sweat, having not washed their feet for the better part of a month, and reeking of alcohol, they infuse the air in a room with unfathomable rankness.Imagine, an entire room filled with such unsanitary individuals. Mighty though Dehya might be, she has little desire to spend her time choking for breath.As such, she sticks to a number of ironclad personal habits that separate her from the many slobs who plague their trade, leave her employers with a good impression, and keep her looking good at all times.A portion of her hard-earned Mora, likewise, is always placed into getting jewelry and cosmetics. She treats such purchases as rightful rewards derived from fruitful labor.When one is constantly surrounded by such fatiguing things as weapons, enemies, and business, a little care and gentleness go a long way toward lowering her defenses, allowing her to face the coming future with a softened heart.Though it is true that Dehya is a ferocious mercenary, she is, always first and foremost, a lovely and carefree woman.
Unlike many who leave the desert and never look back, Dehya has always been proud of her heritage. However, her identity has indeed also introduced a great many obstacles into her life.She lacked a systematized education and was in turn also bereft of any complex technical knowledge besides that which had to do with martial prowess and desert survival. Such was the case for many an Eremite mercenary.It is clear to Dehya that this lack of knowledge has constrained her people and their potential, their energies and curiosity long subsumed by the sandstorms and the sweltering heat. If she hadn't encountered the miraculous creations of the Akademiya, tasted the fine wines of Mondstadt, beheld the elaborately crafted utensils from Liyue, or the mechanical brilliance possessed by the people of Fontaine, she too would have been unable to see past the borders of her environment.Measured on merits of courage alone, the folk of the rainforest pale before the tenacious desertfolk. Avatars of determination, even after being lashed by the winnowing tongue of the withering winds for years uncounted, the people of the desert continue to live on, generation to generation, their bodies and minds as enduring as the rock of mountains, perhaps even more so.But if they lack foresight to see beyond the present and visible, they will always only be crawling about in the sand.The Mora they earn devoted solely to food and drink, their wealth flowing out as fast as it comes in, passing through them like the sand within an hourglass. The few among them who possessed foresight and intellect knew that to find a better life, changes were needed. But those individuals often cast the desert behind them upon embracing said better life, shifting to lives lived only for themselves."Why can't we be more? Why must we be bound to spending our strength - even our lives - to live just a little better?"They were made by the desert, but also shackled to it. Dehya desires to transcend such limitations. At present, she is still contemplating what kind of future she desires to seek.How far someone can progress in life is not all determined by something as subjective as personal will - Dehya understands that all too well. But she also knows that, so long as there is a chance, she will try to deliver hope back to the desert, to do something for those still living there.Though her future paths may lead elsewhere, the sands will always be her home.
According to Kusayla, when a lion roars, even the blazing sun must shiver.Little Dehya had never seen an actual lion before, so whatever Kusayla claimed, she heeded without question.Kusayla would vividly describe how the sun would cleave the land with its heat, warping mud to powder and distorting the very air in the atmosphere. Despite this, the lion constantly thundered onward, striding across this burning plain. Try as the sun might, the lion's approach was constant and unrelenting, pursuing the star tirelessly with its roaring until the light finally fled past the horizon.Such was the might of the lion.Enraptured by the story, little Dehya's eyes gleamed bright, brighter even than the campfire burning beneath a blanket of night."The lion can..." Kusayla's eyes scythed about for a moment before he snatched one of his slimmer compatriots to use as a volunteer to complete his analogy. "The lion can take out ten guys his size. Easy.""What about you? Can you beat the lion?" Little Dehya asked Kusayla."Hard to say, but I know quite a few tricks, so I think should be able to give that beast the business." Caution lit Kusayla's expression, betraying no hint of boasting."If the lion charges me, I'll... dip down beneath it, angle myself under its body, and then... Open its stomach with my blade. That should be enough to do it in."Unsatisfied with mere words, Kusayla called upon another of their band to pretend to be a lion, planning to give a personal performance for a triumph most hypothetical. Unfortunately, their acting left much to be desired, with the "lion's" roars crippled by a lack of presence, sounding more dog-like than anything.Dehya was unsurprised. She knew what kind of character her father was. It was folly to take all he said seriously, and only disappointment awaited if one did so. All she really had to do was laugh along with him.The Legend of the Lion, however, did linger in her recollections.Many years later, just as Dehya and her companions were deciding what title would sound best for her, the Lion was mentioned, pulling her back to this childhood fable, and her father, who had put everything into the form of a play for her.Though she had been estranged from Kusayla by then, she couldn't help but indulge in the nostalgia of her youth.Now, she finally understood what her father felt in his heart all those years ago, though he was now gone, adrift in the Eternal Dreamland.This would prove one regret she would not be able to reverse. But still, one must veer toward optimism, for bitterness did not suit the lifestyle of one working in the desert. Besides, the memories of her preadolescence were now things she could openly look back upon with a sense of satisfaction.Recalling her girlhood, Dehya's eyes couldn't help but light up just as they had beside the campfire beneath the night sky all those years ago.She would become a lion, akin to the one told of in Kusayla's story, so that the legend might yet live on through her.
Dehya isn't all that sure when her Vision manifested precisely, but she guesses that it might have appeared when she had just started walking her own path.During that time, she was consumed with thoughts of growing stronger.As a mercenary, being weak meant not being able to take on enough commissions, which in turn meant no Mora for food.It was during this critical juncture that the Vision appeared by her side. With how stretched for Mora she was, she even considered trading it in for actual currency.People all say that to be granted a Vision is a sign of divine favor, but Dehya felt that if she was truly chosen, the gods would have sent her Mora instead of some trinket that lacked instant monetary value.Additionally, though the Vision can help her direct the elements, victory in a true battle is still decided by skill, judgment, strategy, and physical conditioning.There are many legendary mercenaries who achieved such renown even without a Vision, relying only on training and grit.Dehya likewise understood that, should one become overcome by pride at having the gods' favor, stop thinking things through, and fail to appreciate that which is before them, no enemy would be required to punish such hubris. The desert itself would exact vengeance upon such folly on its own.The things she would experience thereafter would serve as further proof that even divine power has limitations. For all their might and wisdom, Lesser Lord Kusanali even a god might be constrained.Dehya likes her Vision, but she will not bend to become an apostle after a mere brush with divine attention.She is a mercenary. Someone who lives and dies by the blade. Such a person trusts only in the sweat shed to feed countless gardens of battle and bloodshed.

<title>Roald</title>
<text>Roald, most commonly known as Roald the Adventurer, is a famous adventurer whose skill and determination is only outclassed by his ability to consistently lose his diary.
He is the author of Diary of Roald the Adventurer, a series of diaries located primarily across Liyue that the Traveler can find after he lost them.
Profile
Roald is a famous adventurer who travels around Teyvat. At some point prior to the Traveler's arrival, he had just finished up exploring Liyue and made his way to Inazuma. However, he severely underestimated the severity of the situation at the time and was forced to rely on Sumida and Kama to get across Inazuma as he lacked the permits. Roald eventually became aware of the Traveler's reputation during his travels.
Roald would eventually be commissioned by Sumida to obtain a Maushiro and met Ruu on Tsurumi Island. However, he did not know the true extent of the situation of the island and when he returned to bring the Maushiro back, it had disappeared. After meeting the Traveler, he returned to Tsurumi Island and asked the Traveler to bring him some Fluorescent Fungus and take photos of murals on the island. After returning with them, Roald thanked them and departed from the island, only to unknowingly drop his most recent diary in the process.

Bennett believes his Vision is a sign from the gods: a sign that they have not given up on him, just like how the old and or retired veteran adventurers from the Guild - whom he affectionately refers to as "dads" - have not given up on him either.
Appearance

Character Stories
Benny's Adventure Team is an exception to the norm in the Adventurers' Guild, Mondstadt Branch.Initially, the team mechanism requiring at least 3 or 4 regulars in each team was set up to promote mutual support and prevent accidents.As for Benny's Adventure Team, however, its only regular member has been Bennett himself.The lack of team members essentially has everything to do with Bennett's infamous bad luck.However, being the passionate adventurer he is, Bennett never feels lonely.Well, maybe once or twice, sometimes...
The adventurer Jack was the first victim of Benny's Adventure Team.Just a few feet away from the treasure, an extremely rare Geo Turbulence occurred, tearing the ground apart and opening a bottomless chasm right before everyone's eyes."So close, yet so far... like love."Jack only suffered minor injuries, but he was never the same as an adventurer thereafter. The event seemed to have left him with a broken heart.Another member, Royce, heard someone shout "Heyo!" before losing consciousness in a huge explosion. The culprit, Klee, was sent to the confinement room for seven days for mistaking the cave the adventurers were still exploring in for a giant rabbit hole and blowing it up.Heckler suffered from a severe bout of diarrhea for a week after joining the team. Although it turned out to be food poisoning, he insisted it was because of Bennett's bad luck."They'll be back! They're just... on leave. Please don't invalidate my team's registration with the Guild..."Seeing Bennett beg and plead before her eyes, Katheryne sighed and decided to spare him the truth that his "teammates" had long jumped ship.
There was once a predicament of incomparable despair.A predicament that had all but swallowed an old adventurer.The scorching flames scalded his skin, the deafening thunder almost ruptured his eardrums, and the hollering winds threatened to rip his soul from him.At the end of his hellish journey, what awaited him was... a baby.The old adventurer thought he was the first living thing to pass through this arduous ordeal. But how could he explain that which lay before him?In that moment, it hit him, and he believed it to be true."This baby must be... a child abandoned by the world itself."Though there were no mighty artifacts, jewelry, or gold, the old man's face did not seem disappointed in the slightest, for he regarded this baby, whose life hung by a mere thread, to be his treasure."This child is what I was meant to find on this journey," he thought as he took the baby into his arms.Even if what he was about to do opposed the will of the world itself, he was unafraid.
The old adventurer died from severe injuries before being able to tell this story, leaving only the child he had saved.On his deathbed, he only managed four final words: "will," "adventure," and "final treasure."Several single, childless, old adventurers in the Adventurers' Guild in Mondstadt raised the child as their own and named him Bennett.Being raised by the Guild, Bennett referred to everyone as "Dad.""Dad, your dentures fell into the bowl!" "Dad, you should stop wearing that old leather armor. Where are the undergarments I bought you?" "Dad, it's raining, better keep your distance from me so you don't get struck by lightning!"Taking care of all his aging dads who have no family has taken up most of his time outside of adventuring."The dads certainly have found a treasure, haha!"Cyrus, the current Guild Master, laughed, giving Bennett a pat on the back.Though he is unlucky himself, he can at least try to bring luck to those he cares about. At least, that's how Bennett feels.Bennett the Unlucky still strives to find his own lucky treasure through his series of unfortunate events.
Oz the Raven, Fischl's familiar, said Bennett is "the most tenacious young man in the world."Indeed, Bennett's share of bad luck throughout his life can be seen from his scars, old and new.Attacked by monsters, buried in collapsed ruins, falling from cliffs... A wealth of "unfortunate events" has taught Bennett how to deal with more of them in the future.Barbara, the Deaconess at the Church of Favonius, was once surprised by how skilled Bennett is at treating dislocated joints.Another gift from his ordeals is his jaw-dropping talent for combat."Look at his moves... Doesn't that hurt?" Grand Master Varka of the Knights of Favonius Knights was extremely intrigued after seeing Bennett in combat.It's not that Bennett doesn't feel pain - he has simply gotten used to it. He adapted to the pain as others would to pungent smells or blinding light.Therefore, the way Bennett dives into battles head-on without reservation has become a signature of his.
What does death mean, exactly? Always walking the thin line between life and death, Bennett can't help but wonder.Bennett knows that the old adventurer who saved him has left many praiseworthy stories and legends after his death.He knows that adventurers will not have weeping at their funerals, only toasts made in their names by old comrades.He knows, to the adventurers of Mondstadt, a "good death" comes at the end of a life given to the pursuit of treasure and the secrets of the world. Once over, their souls are brought back to their homeland by Barbatos.He once feared death.However, after pondering on this matter some more, he now feels death may be something fortunate for an adventurer...Not that fortune has anything to do with him."Onto the next treasure!" And with that, Bennett puts this thinking business behind him.
Whenever he suffers severe injuries such as fractures or excessive loss of blood, Bennett will go to the Favonius Cathedral Cathedral to seek treatment from Deaconess Barbara."Sorry, it's me again..." Bennett will say, scratching the back of his head.Barbara, however, will just shake her head, and with a "let's deal with those scratches as well," she will toss him some adhesive bandages.Such displays of concern may be inadvertent, but they have a special place in Bennett's heart. He sticks those bandages on his wounds with the care of one pinning a medal to their chest, before thanking her wholeheartedly.Bennett keeps many such bandages in his utility pouch when he goes on adventures. Ones he gets from his dads, from Barbara, from Katheryne... and from adventurers he sometimes meets by chance after getting injured.These tiny tokens of goodwill form a tangible collection of fair fortune unique to Bennett."Well, since everyone's by my side, I guess I'm not that unlucky after all."
Bennett's passion for adventure is unstoppable.He wants to constantly explore, challenge, sweat it out, and eventually grow old on the adventurer's path.But there was once when he met with a true crisis.Just as that old adventurer had so long ago, Bennett was in a predicament that would cause any other person to despair."Losing this much blood... Not good."But Bennett did not stop. "There's no reason to turn back," he thought.Somehow, he just knew that all the agonizing misfortune he had suffered up till this point was for the sake of overcoming this precarious position.But at the end of his hellish journey, what he found at the end was - nothing at all."Ha, returning empty-handed is... part of an adventure. I... don't mind..."At last, his tightly-wound emotions came loose, allowing his many injuries to rob him of his consciousness, and he collapsed.When he reawakened, he found that his wounds had been cauterized by a Pyro mysterious flame, stopping both the bleeding and the pain.A Vision jewel pulsed warmly in the palm of his hand, its rhythm in time with the heartbeat in his chest - the beating heart of an adventurer.This was not the mercy of the world, or that fate took pity on him. Rather, this was his "final reward," one befitting a person with Bennett's burning passion.

<title>Lightning</title>
<text>the environmental hazard the element Electro
Lightning is an environmental hazard encountered during thunderstorms, in certain challenges such as domains, and in certain areas of high Electro concentration. All lightning strikes deal Electro DMG and have glowing indicators of the strike area 1–2 seconds in advance.
Like other sources of Electro DMG, lightning that strikes any spot in a body of water will cause that spot to be Electro-Charged for a short period of time and deal Electro DMG upon contact. However, in Genshin Impact, lightning technically only strikes the point of impact, such as land, and the Electro-Charged status on water only occurs on the water's surface. As such, lightning that strikes land far enough below the surface of water will not cause the water to become Electro-Charged.
The attack of Lightning has 200 Poise Damage internally.
Thunderstorms
Weather Thunderstorm
* Lightning targets land. Frozen water is considered land.
* The indicator will be blue and crackling. If the ground is below water, then the indicator may look smaller, depending on how far below water the ground is.
* A lightning strike may generate one Electro Energy particle if it does not hit the player.
* After striking, the target will get 2 Elemental Gauge Theory units of Electro. It will immediately react with the Hydro element from the Wet status of rain and cause an Electro-Charged status.
* A Nation Closed by Thunder is notable for having lightning strikes that deal exactly 20 damage. Lightning strikes that hit frozen water in this climate will cause a Superconduct reaction that can deal exactly 8 damage.
* Electrograna cannot protect against lightning strikes during thunderstorms.
Seirai Island
* Lightning targets the player or land while in a Balethunder-affected area on Seirai Island before completing the Seirai Stormchasers series.
* The indicator will be blue and crackling.
* Immediately after each lightning strike, another lightning strike will target the player, which means players must constantly move in order to not get hit.
* Lightning that targets players can also target them while they are in mid-air and strike the air.
Thunder Sakura
Thunder Sakura
* Lightning targets the player on land or when no higher than an ordinary jump off the ground when near a Thunder Sakura before completion of Sakura Arborism.
* The indicator will be purple/pink.
* After each lightning strike, another lightning strike will target the player, which means players must constantly move or glide in order to not get hit.
* Electrograna can nullify the damage from the Thunder Sakura's lightning strikes.
Special Lightning
Lightning Bolts
Lightning Bolt
* Lightning Bolts are encountered as a Ley Line Disorder as well as in certain Time Trial Challenges, such as in the commission Practice Makes Perfect.
* Lightning Bolts target land.
* The indicator is a scope-like circle, similar to the circle that appears for Amber's Fiery Rain.
* When Lightning Bolts hit a character, their Energy is drained.
* Lightning Bolts may leave behind balls of lightning that deal damage to nearby players.
Sword Hilts
Sword Hilts
* Lightning targets the player once upon each interaction with an energized Sword Hilt.
* The indicator will be purple/pink.
* Electrograna can nullify the damage from the lightning strike.</text>

Personality
A traveler from another world who had their only kin taken away, forcing them to embark on a journey to find The Seven.
The Traveler's personality is determined primarily by the player themselves through dialogue options.
Their personality can range from stoic, humble and helpful to boastful, lazy and short-tempered. Regardless of the player's in-game decisions, they are generally liked by the playable characters. There are instances of single speech options or similar options which give a glimpse at their personality overall. They are, for example, observed by Paimon as not believing the gods are any more worthy of unearned respect than mortal inhabitants of Teyvat. They also are pointedly uninterested in getting involved with each nation's troubles and primarily only concern themselves with finding out their sibling's whereabouts. Their response to Morax's "death" was initially to simply leave, both to avoid suspicion and seemingly a level of apathy considering the circumstances of their arrival on the world.
This trend continues into Inazuma, where the Traveler initially denies aid to the rebellion and refuses to take sides, interested only in meeting with the Raiden Shogun. The Traveler is visibly frustrated, not wanting to meddle in the country's affairs or get involved with anyone, even for a task as simple as Chisato's Letter delivering a letter. Yet despite this hesitation to get involved, they are ultimately a compassionate person, eventually choosing to aid the resistance against the Shogun's injustice after seeing the circumstances of each situation particularly at the prodding of Kamisato Ayaka and Thoma. Later on in Sumeru, they later help free Lesser Lord Kusanali from the sages of the Sumeru Akademiya after learning of her plight.  Despite their slight indifference to Teyvat's conflicts, they greatly cherish every bond they create with the people.
The Traveler does not appear to be very talkative, with several characters noting that they are not very fond of speaking or starting conversations. Shikanoin Heizou also once joked about Paimon serving as the Traveler's "voice."
Due to their experiences with the Fatui and the Abyss Order, the Traveler is immediately on guard at the mere mention of them, though on somewhat reasonable terms with some of their members who respect them, such as Tartaglia and The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou" Enjou. Although initially friendly with Lyney and Lynette, the Traveler found it difficult to trust them after learning that they were Fatui operatives from the House of the Hearth, ultimately defending them from false accusations regardless. The Traveler also took sympathy on Lyudochka Snezhevna after seeing her regretful of her actions as a Fatui, and helped her to defect from the organization. They also show significant concern for their Traveler's Sibling sibling, as their initial goal was to find them and get answers from the Unknown God that sealed them away. Even after becoming aware of their position with the Abyss, they still ultimately resolve to follow their instructions in seeing the world for themselves.
Appearance
Rising Star
Aether uses the Medium Male Characters medium male model, and Lumine uses the Medium Female Characters medium female model. Both siblings have f=blonde hair, fiery-gold eyes, and pale skin. During their fight with the unknown god, both siblings had yellow wings.
Aether's hair is a more saturated color and very long, while Lumine's hair is paler and chin-length except for two locks of shoulder-length hair framing her face. Lumine also has two light-blue Inteyvat flowers pinned on the right of her head and two pale blue feathers tucked at the left.
Story
History
Aether and Lumine arrive in Teyvat, yet for some unknown reason the player's chosen sibling does not wake and remained asleep for an unspecified amount of time. The Traveler's sibling eventually manages to wake them up and says that they should leave, with both twins witnessing the destruction of Khaenri'ah.We Will Be Reunited However, an Unknown God, describing herself to be the Sustainer of Heavenly Principles, blocked their way. A fight ensued and resulted in one of the twins getting consumed by red cubes from the Unknown God, and the other trapped in a seal which caused them to lose their powers. Five hundred years later, the Traveler wakes up, separated from their sibling, and stranded. One day they accidentally fish out Paimon from the sea, saving her from drowning.Congenial Gathering
Paimon would stay with the Traveler and teach them the Teyvat Language: to her amazement, it only took them two months to become a conversational speaker. After learning of how they got stranded on Teyvat at the start of the game, Paimon suggests they get in contact with The Seven, in order to help the Traveler look for their lost sibling. Along the way, the Traveler resonates with a Statue of The Seven, resonating with the Anemo element and allowing them to wield it despite not having a Vision. The Traveler's trip starts at Mondstadt, the City of Freedom, and meet Amber Outrider Amber. Though Amber promises to help the Traveler with looking for their sibling, she mentions that she and the rest of the Knights of Favonius are currently preoccupied with Stormterror terrorizing the city. They help out with the incident, which they find out was orchestrated by the Abyss Order, and learn that the bard Venti is actually Barbatos, one of the Seven, and the Anemo Archon. They also first encounter the Fatui and the Harbinger Signora here, who take advantage of the situation to steal the Gnosis from Venti. They also learn that the Tsaritsa, the Cryo Archon and ruler of Snezhnaya, appears to have unknown motives. Venti apologizes as they know not the God who took their kin away, but suggests they head to Liyue to meet with Morax, the eldest of the Seven and the Geo Archon, who may be able to provide them with answers.
At Liyue, the Traveler and Paimon attempt to meet with Morax at the Rite of Descension, only for him to inexplicably die and are subsequently made a suspect due to being foreigners. They are able to escape with the aid of another Harbinger, Tartaglia Childe, who suggests they meet with the adepti to resolve the issue. He introduces them to Zhongli, a consultant at the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor who can bring them to Morax's Exuvia, or the corpse. Childe's assistance is later revealed to be a ruse as he attempts to steal the Gnosis from the Exuvia but finds that it's already gone. He then breaks the ancient god Osial out of Morax's binds, but with the help of the Liyue Qixing and adepti, they manage to repel the ancient god. Only after resolving the issue do they learn that Zhongli is actually the Geo Archon, that he was retiring from his position and thus faked his death with the help of Signora La Signora, representing the Tsaritsa, whom he had made a contract with. He hands over his Gnosis for delivery to the Cryo Archon as per their agreement. As the Fatui leave, Zhongli tells the Traveler to head to Inazuma.
While waiting for the chance to do so, they are recalled to Mondstadt where they meet with Dainsleif, who wishes to stop the Abyss Order. Dainsleif warns them against siding with the Archons, mentioning how the gods were the reason why Khaenri'ah was destroyed. During this time, they stop a plot in which the Order was attempting to "mechanise" Osial to do their bidding. Unexpectedly, they manage to run into their sibling, but are shocked to learn that they lead the Order. They attempt to convince their sibling to leave Teyvat with them, but the sibling refuses, mentioning that they still have a war to fight in. The sibling instructs them to continue traveling Teyvat so they can experience the truth first-hand before leaving, with Dainsleif chasing after them. The Traveler attempts to follow but is shut out.
Back in Liyue, the Traveler tries to meet with Zhongli to get answers regarding the truth about what happened in Khaenri'ah, however he says he is bound by contract to not speak of it. With help from the Crux crew, the Traveler is able to bypass the storm and arrives in Inazuma, where they witness the land in chaos due to the Vision Hunt Decree, the Sakoku Decree, and a civil war between the Inazuma Shogunate Shogunate and the Watatsumi Army Resistance. Hearing of their feats in the other nations, Kamisato Ayaka and Thoma attempt to persuade the Traveler to help but are shut down, saying that they are only here to meet with the Electro Archon and nothing else. Ayaka agrees to help them meet with the Shogun but instructs them to first see victims of the Vision Hunt Decree, after which they agree to help with the war. They soon join the Resistance based on Watatsumi Island after meeting the Shogun and nearly being killed by her. In their journey, they meet with the Guuji of the Grand Narukami Shrine Yae Miko, who reveals that the Shogun is actually just a robotic puppet and that Ei, the Archon they are looking for, resides inside it. They soon learn that the chaos in Inazuma was caused by the Fatui and confront Signora, defeating her in a duel before the throne and witnesses her death at the Shogun's hands. The Shogun then tries to cut them down as they leave Tenshukaku, but the timely arrival of the resistance allows the Traveler to confront Ei once more and defeat her with the aspirations of the seized Visions, prompting her to abolish the Vision Hunt Decree. With the chaos resolved, Yae thanks them for their assistance, but mentions that they know nothing about the Traveler's sibling or the Unknown God. She then advises them to make their way to Sumeru next.
While crossing to Sumeru via the Chasm, the Traveler investigates the mysterious area and discovers an Abyss Order plot intending to use a strange water source found in the depths of the cave to restore the hilichurls' minds, learning some of their past from Dainsleif. After this trip, they arrive at Sumeru and are greeted with a vision of a massive Irminsul tree and try to speak with Lesser Lord Kusanali, only to discover that the sages of the Sumeru Akademiya had shut off all physical access to her. The Traveler is roped into a plot by the sages to harvest energy to power a god, upon which they finally meet her while in a dream samsara; with her aid, they are able to break it and free the city's inhabitants. Learning of the full extent of the plot, they manage to find allies to stop the sages, who had been gathering resources to create a new God of Wisdom by empowering Scaramouche. They ultimately defeat him and witness Kusanali remove Greater Lord Rukkhadevata from Irminsul, but as it had not stored data on them, were one of the few who were not affected by the change in data. Ultimately, they chose to keep information about Rukkhadevata a secret to respect her last wish. While talking with Kusanali, they are knocked out by a sound wave by Il Dottore and learn that she had given up both her and Ei's Gnosis for information. Kusanali then suggests they visit Fontaine next to meet with its Archon, Focalors. She also informed them that they were labeled by the Fatui as a "Descender" and that their sibling was not one of them, leaving them wondering if Teyvat had done something to their sibling as they had always been traveling the universe together.
Similarly to the other nations, while waiting for the chance to enter Fontaine, the Traveler meets with Nahida and Scaramouche, the former trying to find information in Irminsul about their sibling and putting the latter into their custody while searching. During the trip, Scaramouche learned the full extent of Dottore's manipulation and willingly erased himself from Irminsul, prompting the Traveler to return to Inazuma to see what changes he had made. They ultimately discover that the changes were minimal, as the events still occurred with different actors and find him in the new iteration as a wanderer. With Kusanali's aid, they restored his memories and the Traveler could rename him.
Later on, the Traveler caught up with Kaeya at Port Ormos before running into Dainsleif yet again, where they investigated Avidya Forest to help jog his memories. During the investigation, Dainsleif went off to investigate the Ley Lines and discovered that the Abyss Order had tampered with them. While he had been investigating, the Traveler encountered a fragment of their sibling's memory, learning how the Abyss Order was founded and their encounter with a "Voice Inside the Head Sinner" that was responsible for Order's foundation.

<title>Illuminated Beast</title>
<text>Adepti
An illuminated beast zh=仙兽 zh_rm=xiānshòu is a creature with supernatural abilities, including heightened combat prowess, extreme longevity, and the ability to speak human language. Most known illuminated beasts are also adepti and have signed a contract with Morax to protect Liyue.
Overview
Little is known about the origins of illuminated beasts or what being an illuminated beast entails due to their conflation with adepti. Madame Ping mentions that the adeptal arts taught to them by Morax were part of their "illumination,"A Teapot to Call Home: Part I which suggests that not all illuminated beasts are born illuminated. Further supporting this idea is the fact that Xianyun Cloud Retainer and Mountain Shaper are both cranes, but various species of cranes can be hunted like regular animals and display no sign of illumination.
Full-blooded illuminated beasts can shapeshift into human formsSky-Gazers, Land-WalkersMoonlit Bamboo Forest (II) and create offspring with mortal humans.Records of Jueyun: Qilin Such half-blooded children will be humanoid with a few non-human traits indicating their illuminated beast heritage; it is unclear how their illuminated beast heritage will affect their growth, aging, or mystical abilities, if at all. Of the two currently known cases, Ganyu is old enough to witness the fall of the Guili Assembly and the rise of Liyue Harbor 3,700 years ago, yet she has the stature of a teenager. On the other hand, Yanfei has the stature of a teenager, but she is young enough that her mortal mother is still alive and traveling with her father, a full-blooded adeptus.

<title>Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale</title>
<text>The Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale, also succinctly addressed as the Oratrice, is a large mechanical weighing scale located in the Court of Fontaine's Opera Epiclese (Instance) Opera Epiclese, created by Focalors. It converts people's belief in justice into Indemnitium, a power source used in the Court of Fontaine and Erinnyes.YouTube:
Aside from serving as a power generator, the Oratrice also appears to have a consciousness of its own and delivers judgment with accurate sentences at the Opera Epiclese. How and why the Oratrice can do this are the subjects of Lyney's curiosity and he theorizes it may have something to do with the prophesied crisis. Regardless of what the Neuvillette Chief Justice believes during the trial, they must honor the results of the Oratrice.
It is later revealed that Focalors was contained within the Oratrice and that only a fraction of Indemnitium produced by the Oratrice was ever used to power Fontaine; in reality, most of it went to give the Oratrice enough power to execute Focalors and destroy the Hydro Archon's Divine Throne. This action returned the Hydro Archon's power to the Dragon of Water to forgive the people of Fontaine of its "Original Sin" and save them from the prophecy.

Fontaine runs on a "very special" energy system and has been plagued with power issues for centuries, which has led Fontainians to be concerned for the sustainability of this system.A-Toymaking We Shall Go: Core Propulsion Bertrand: The energy system there is very special, and no one knows how long it can be sustained. Thus, we must find alternative energy solutions before it all comes crashing down. The Oratrice collects people's belief in "justice" during the "process of 'judgment'" and turns it into Indemnitium, which provides energy for various amenities in Fontaine, including lamps and transportation systems. It is later revealed that only a small fraction of the Indemnitium was ever used to power Fontaine; if it were not for Focalors' own plan, the amount of energy that the Oratrice had accumulated over 500 years would have been able to power Fontaine for millennia.
An impending energy crisis between 400 and 500 years ago led Rene and Jakob, two members of the Narzissenkreuz Institute, to search for a solution in the Khaenri'ahn ruins at the Girdle of the Sands.Rene's Investigation Notes Their discoveries were brought back to Alain Guillotin, who went on to devise the Pneuma-Ousia Arkhe system which continues to power the Clockwork Meka to this day.
Settlements such as the Court of Fontaine and the island of Erinnyes continue to be powered by the Oratrice. Even with the Arkhe system in place, wholly replacing the Oratrice has been difficult and research into alternate energy systems has continued. While members of the Fontaine Research Institute are focused on developing entirely new systems, Lyney appears to believe the mysteries behind the Oratrice are the key to resolving Fontaine's issues.
During the trial against Lyney and Lynette by Furina, the Oratrice listened to the case then shifting its scales after hearing arguments and objections from both sides. After learning that the entire trial was an accident caused by Liliane and that Cowell was the actual perpetrator, the Oratrice gave a non-guilty verdict to both him and Lynette. Lyney attempted to investigate the Oratrice per The Knave Father's request, but was forced to retreat when he heard a voice from the Oratrice that appeared to know him, which also contaminated him with a large quantity of Indemnitium.
During the events of 'As Light Rain Falls Without Reason', the Oratrice ended up giving a guilty verdict to Tartaglia despite having been cleared of charges stemming from the mysterious disappearance cases, leaving both Neuvillette and Furina surprised and baffled by the result, as it was the first time since its operation it did not agree with the Chief Justice's view. This prompted Neuvillette to personally investigate the machine and Tartaglia's case himself while Furina managed to cover up the machine's error through dramatics and bravado. But even after the disaster passed, Neuvillette still cannot truly understand why the Oratrice gave a guilty verdict and he assumed that it is either liability by association because Tartaglia awakened the All-Devouring Narwhal when he was young or Focalors deliberately using him to buy time on the assumption that he would be able to hold the All-Devouring Narwhal off.
When The Knave Arlecchino had a meeting with Furina (as a tea party), after Neuvillette had sealed the Primordial Sea from engulfing Fontaine, she asked her about her plan to stop the prophecy. Furina claimed that she had a plan, though Arlecchino doubted her claim. Based on what she had learned from Lyney, she surmised that someone was accumulating Indemnitium for an unknown cause but did not go further into the matter and quickly changed the subject.
As the prophecy began to loom over Fontaine, the Traveler and Neuvillette concocted a "trap" to make Furina reveal her hidden secrets to avoid it. The Traveler deduced her of being a fraud, gaining the support of the audience through various evidence they obtained in their encounters. The Oratrice agreed with Neuvillette's judgment of her being guilty, but gave a verdict condemning "the Hydro Archon" to the death sentence, even though the trial was held precisely to prove that Furina was not the Archon, surprising everyone present. The death sentence in particular caused much shock and horror for the audience as it was a penalty that was never been handed out before, to the point that some thought its availability was a mere myth.
Focalors later met with Neuvillette inside of her consciousness, revealing her intricate plan to deceive the Heavenly Principles and save their people; The Oratrice was never an enactor of justice and instead a device to kill the God of Justice, constantly accumulating Indemnitium within the Oratrice in the last 500 years. Focalors would use the acquired Indemnitium to kill herself and destroy the Hydro Archon's Divine Throne, restoring Neuvillette's full authority as the Hydro Dragon Sovereign. Neuvillette also realized that the Oratrice's call for the death sentence of "Hydro Archon" refers to neither Furina or Focalors, but to the Divine Throne of Hydro Archon itself. After Focalors executed herself, the Oratrice is now non-functional and no longer provides Indemnitium for Fontaine's needs,The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur though Neuvillette's restored authority allowed him complete control over Pneumousia energy to serve as a substitute for the time being. Neuvillete also decided to take over its role in court trials and he will personally hear all cases and pass verdicts going forward.</text>

<title>Han Wu</title>
<text>Han Wu zh=寒武 zh_rm=Hán Wǔ was a master weaponsmith in Liyue who lived around the time of the cataclysm five hundred years ago. He is most famous for developing the Prototype Series with fellow weaponsmith Yun Hui, as well some of the weapons in the Blackcliff Series.
Story
After the cataclysm ended, monsters still ran rampant across Teyvat. To combat them, people turned towards supernatural arts, but found that the weapon production techniques were not up to par and broke easily. Realizing they had reached the limits of the individual skill, Han Wu and Yun Hui joined forces to develop the Prototype Series.
The two eventually started their own families. Wu's son, Han Ce, had no intention of taking up the family business, however, and became a wanderer who journeyed across Liyue. It was not until after a certain incident at The Chasm (Subregion) The Chasm did father and son reconcile.
Realizing that the ores available to him were limiting his weapons' potential, Wu used one of Hui's connections to take a mining crew into the Chasm in search of crystallized blackcliff. However, a cave-in trapped them inside, completely cutting them off from the outside world. As his men fell to madness and despair, Wu found his prototype sword and used it to carve their way out of the mine. When his sword hit rock, it released a deafening roar - something that none of the survivors ever spoke about.Blackcliff Longsword Lore Wu came out of the incident greatly changed. Upon hearing about it, Ce hurried home and found that his fiery-tempered father had drastically mellowed, and for the first time, the two were able to reconcile.
Several years later, a crisis fell upon Liyue: the Chasm was rocked by great earthquakes, forcing it to be shut down. Upon hearing about this, Wu was wracked with guilt, believing that he had disturbed the dragon that lay underneath it during the cave-in. He dragged himself out of his sickbed to forge Blackcliff Slasher, ordering Ce to build a shrine in the cave and place the sword in it to ward off evil and rebuke the dragon.
A few years after wards, Han Wu passed away peacefully in his sleep. That very same day, the shrine emerged from the cave, the sword glowing as if grieving the death of its creator. Han Ce went to the shrine that night and retrieved the sword.Blackcliff Slasher Lore He also found his father's weapon designs for the prototypes and with them, created the Blackcliff Pole. He decided afterwards to continue the family business.Blackcliff Pole Lore</text>

<title>Faranak</title>
<text>FaranakWondrous Times is a mentioned character. She is the mother of Kaveh. Like her son, she is a Kshahrewar alumnus and a famous architect.
Profile
Over 30 years ago, Faranak attended the Akademiya under the Kshahrewar darshan, mentored by Professor Zaha Hadi. During this period, she met and fell in love with Kaveh's Father Kaveh's father, and the two planned out a future together. Together, they decided to name their son Kaveh, conceiving him over 20 years before the Chapter III began.When the Curtains Close
After the untimely passing of Kaveh's unnamed father, Faranak fell into depression, and "would never again smile." After Kaveh reached schooling age and enrolled in the Akademiya, which resulted in him spending less time with her, she decided to visit Fontaine to ease her grief, and was eventually offered a job there. Kaveh would encourage her, reassuring her that he would be fine on his own, after which she left for Fontaine. Sometime after Kaveh's graduation, she remarried and held a small wedding, which Kaveh attended. All her remaining property in Sumeru, including her home, would be transferred to Kaveh, indicating that she had decided to remain in Fontaine permanently, and she eventually set up a new family there.Competition on the Sands Kaveh has had little contact with her since her remarriage.The Sixth Proposal
She, along with Kaveh's father, had a significant influence on Kaveh's interest in architecture, which he developed at a young age. They both encouraged his interest by providing him with a sketchbook and building blocks to play with as a child, and she also gave him the book "Architectural Drawing Basics," which was authored by her.
She was the primary motivator for Kaveh's interest in architecture. As a child, he would observe her working on blueprints and try to imitate her, resulting in his first sloppy blueprint that he slipped into her work. After inadvertently giving the blueprint that the young Kaveh drew to her client, causing a misunderstanding for everyone involved, she taught Kaveh the basics of creating a blueprint and was patient with him rather than being angry at him for causing the misunderstanding in the first place.Past Mementos She also passed on her love of the arts to him, with Zaha Hadi quoting her as saying during a previous argument with a friend, "True art cannot be understood, but as an artist, I wish some people could understand its meaning and value," echoing Kaveh's feelings about artistic pursuits.
Despite their estrangement, Kaveh speaks highly of her and supports her decision to start a new life in Fontaine, citing how difficult it was for her to raise him alone after his father died. Zaha Hadi further supports this, stating that she had to make many lifestyle changes in order to raise him.
While Faranak's current feelings toward Kaveh are unknown, she considered his future long before he was born and continued to think about what the future had in store for him when she moved to Fontaine.
She may have also been concerned about Kaveh's reaction to her remarriage, as the news was reported to him with "great trepidation and expectation."
Appearance
Her mentor Zaha Hadi describes her as having golden blonde hair and a beautiful and radiant appearance that had attracted many potential suitors to her. She also notes that Kaveh bears a resemblance to his mother.

<title>Futsu Minori</title>
<text>Futsu Minori ja=経津実 ja_rm=Futsu Minori was a historical figure in Inazuma and the third-generation master of the Futsu School, one of the schools in the Raiden Gokaden.
Profile
Futsu Minori was a talented swordsmith of the Futsu School and forged Hasui Geppaku Futsu, a blade worthy enough to be wielded by the Raiden Shogun's valet. She had a son, Futsu Hiroyoshi, and also took in a mute orphan who would take on the name Futsu Masayoshi. Hasui Geppaku Futsu was eventually destroyed in a certain battle to "decide the fate of the oni people." It was sent to the Futsu School to be reforged, but because Minori was no longer in physical condition to forge blades, Masayoshi took the up the task and forged Haran Geppaku Futsu.Haran Geppaku Futsu
Story
Little is known about Futsu Minori's past, but she told Masayoshi about her mother and brother's wishes. She was afflicted by an old wound on her side and owned a crimson hakama that she could never wear. Likely as a result of past woes, Minori was also something of an alcoholic, which contributed her physical decline in the later stages of her life.
Minori had a reputation for capriciousness and arrogance, but Masayoshi was close with her because she had taken him in when nobody else had and gave him his nickname, Masagomaru. She, in turn, confided in him and told him many things about herself that she normally did not divulge, joking that his muteness meant he would not spill her secrets. Masayoshi's talent for bladesmithing led Minori to recommend him as fourth-generation head of the Futsu School multiple times, but he declined every time. After her death, Masayoshi taught Hiroyoshi her techniques and departed from the school after seeing that Hiroyoshi could lead the school on his own.</text>

<title>Fischl/Lore</title>
<text>A mysterious girl who calls herself "Prinzessin der Verurteilung" and travels with a night raven named Oz. Currently serves as an investigator in the Adventurers' Guild.Through her unique abilities, eccentric character, and (while she would never admit it herself) hard work, Fischl has become a rising star among the Adventurers' Guild's investigators, earning the recognition of all.
Personality
A mysterious girl who calls herself "Prinzessin der Verurteilung" and travels with a night raven named Oz.
Due to her upbringing as a child, Fischl is obsessed with fantasy stories and roleplays as a benevolent princess. She speaks in a polite and formal manner to all, which greatly confuses those who interact with her. For this purpose, Oz ends up translating most of her speech if they are confused. She is so used to speaking this way that breaking character ends up confusing the people she talks to just as much as staying in character. Fischl has a knack for investigating in part due to her own theories and Oz, which has allowed her to quickly climb up the ranks of the Adventurers' Guild. Even when her ideas sound outlandish, such as claiming a meteor shower to be the result of a curse, Oz is quick to ask others not to underestimate her intuition, as her instincts are very keen.
Outside of guild duties, many people view her strangely due to her her antics and roleplay, while this sometimes bothers her, she continues roleplaying regardless because it's her passion. She has very few friends and appreciates those who are willing to go along with her despite her eccentricities.
Outside of roleplaying, she is a kind and well-behaved yet bashful girl. She gets along well with her parents, even if she doesn't spend much time with them or they disagree with some of her decisions. Lisa, who generally gets in a bad mood when people neglect the books they borrow from the library, states that Fischl always keeps the books she borrows in good condition and returns them early. She cares about her friends and peers, even if not particularly close, showing concern about the well-being of her "retinue" (Fellow Adventurers' Guild members). When she unintentionally breaks character or reveals something about herself, she often gets flustered. She tends not to dwell too much on the past, trying to see herself as Fischl, not as her true identity, who she considers a different person, as thinking of her past brings her sadness. Deep down, she can also be quite self-deprecating and insecure, having a hard time taking setbacks well, this can cause her to cling to the escapism and comfort of her persona.
Appearance
Dunkelnacht Sakrament Ein Immernachtstraum
Fischl uses the Medium Female Characters medium female model. She has fair skin and blonde hair that extends to the middle of her back. Her visible eye is light green. Over her left eye, she wears an eyepatch that is almost entirely covered by her bangs.
Fischl styles herself after the titular character of the book 'Flowers for Princess Fischl'.
Official Introduction
Fischl:The Prinzessin der Verurteilung - Fischl
Face this false world with pride, my daughter. Enact the 'truth' within your heart.
Fischl, Prinzessin der Verurteilung of the outer realm Immernachtreich, and her kin, the night-bringing raven. Answering the call of destiny, we have descended upon Teyvat.
Fischl introduces herself to every member of the Adventurers' Guild in this way.
Due to her shared vision with the raven Oz, Fischl was able to join the Adventurers' Guild and become an investigator with ease.
Initially, it gave members of the Guild great difficulty to comprehend what Fischl was saying. But thanks to her tireless toil, and Oz's industrious interpretation, everyone was finally able to understand her.
Though eccentric in word and deed, this investigator's reconnaissance is swift and her intelligence accurate, traits that allowed her to gradually win everyone's trust.
It helps that Fischl is also a very kind person.
"Oz, my familiar... spread your wings that eclipse the sun, and keep watch over the one to whom ill fate clings like a shroud."
"Yes, mein Fräulein."
Today, Fischl shall also show concern for the masses of the Adventurers' Guild in her own manner.
Character Stories
Fischl is the Prinzessin der Verurteilung who arrived here after being exiled from the otherworld, "Immernachtreich."She "observes and weaves the threads of fate" together with her talking night raven familiar, Oz.Owing to reasons she cannot and Oz will not explain, Fischl now serves the Adventurers' Guild as an investigator.
As an investigator for the Adventurers' Guild, the single biggest advantage Fischl has over her peers is Oz."Milady, please stop sending me out to spy on Stormterror. That chap could eat me for breakfast! Well, I'm so puny I probably wouldn't even get caught between his teeth, but... Anyway, I don't want to die!""Hmph! You are supposed to be my familiar. Not everyone gets to be the Prinzessin der Verurteilung's familiar, do you understand? Consider it your honor to dedicate your life to serving me!"Fischl is able to see through Oz's eyes. Whenever she wants to, she possesses Oz and looks down upon the earth from the sky.Whether she wants to inspect the flora on the Stormbearer Mountains or observe a disturbance in Wolvendom, through Oz she can see anything and everything.Thanks largely to her unique ability - and, to a lesser extent, to her own effort and peculiar personality - Fischl quickly went from the rookie investigator of the Adventurers' Guild to a respected rising star of the organization.She's certainly done well for herself. She only landed the coveted position of Investigator at age fourteen in the first place because her parents managed to persuade the Cyrus guild master.Then again, would they really have had to do much persuading? If she's the Prinzessin der Verurteilung... one can only assume that would make them the Kaiser und Kaiserin der Verurteilung.
It's said that there is currently a "Fischl Dictionary" in circulation among the adventurers.Namely, a book that aims to translate Fischl's peculiar way of speaking into something more understandable.For example:"I hear... echoing in the abyss of time, the burning winds of the old, all of which shape the spire forgotten in the torrents of karma" would translate into "Stormterror's Lair";"Servants of the Verurteilung name! As you have requested, prepare to receive the great wisdom of the prinzessin" would be "I'll look into that and let you know ASAP";"Rejoice! O, ye servants who long for the blessing of the prinzessin; venture now deep into the battlefield with hearts of the tiger" means that the initial investigative work has been completed;"All has been written in this tome of dark prophecies" simply means that her journal has been updated with the latest reports.However, the "Fischl Dictionary" is actually just an in-joke, not a real book.Those who are familiar with Fischl concentrate on what she means to say, not the way in which she says it; she notices this and takes it as a sign of true respect."Aha! So you do understand. Then fate does indeed bring kindred spirits together."Those who manage to adopt her speech mannerisms when they respond to her will find she is both delighted and bashful, and praises their language-learning ability."A prinzessin should always give praise where praise is due... Now, let us converse some more. Do not be mistaken; these are to be the foundations of the new world..."
Oz and Princess Fischl are not only close friends but also servant and master, with a shared soul and fate.Their first encounter was mentioned in "Flowers for Princess Fischl (I): End Time Zersetzung"When the lone pilgrimaging princess reached the kingdom of eternal twilight, the fate-resisting royals chose to deny everything in their desperation.They refused to recognize Fischl's noble stature and mission as the princess of the Immernachtreich; denied their 13,000-year lineage as a branch of the royal family; and forsook their own nobility and restraints as humans... devolving into clumsy and vicious beasts.In the palace of Twilight and amidst the teeth of the beasts, the princess shed her sacred blood on the ancient emblem.At the moment of her peril, the dark wings of the night ripped the trapped, wounded princess from her despair and took her under its wings.Following the scent of her noble blood, Ozvaldo Hrafnavins, the King of Ravens came to the princess and pledged his eternal loyalty.
There is a story that goes as follows. A long time ago in a place far, far away, there was a tiny little girl.The girl's parents were busy adventurers. She spent most of her childhood in the library, traversing the countless universes that were contained in the pages of the library books.She became the ruler of the Immernachtreich, summoned Thundering Retribution as a royal princess, and formed a soul bond with a Raven......"Amy, what books did you read today?" Her parents asked her on one of the rare occasions that they were home between adventures.She proceeded to tell them the story she had read from her favorite series."...And then he said, Fischl von Luftschloss Narfidort, you are the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, my proud daughter. You shall never surrender your nobility and dreams.'""Oh, that's a lovely story. Since you like it so much, Amy, how about I call you "Fischl" too?" Her father smiled, put his hand on her head and repeated the words from the story to her."Fischl, you are my wonderful princess and my proud daughter. You shall never surrender your nobility and dreams."These kind and loving words lit up her world.However, the time with her busy parents was always fleeting.Unable to fit in with her peers due to her obsession with fantasy novels, she often felt lonely and sad. At these times, she would remind herself:"I am Fischl, my daddy's wonderful princess. It's true, because Mommy and Daddy said so...""Never will I surrender my nobility and dreams, for they are... a princess' rite of passage."
Just like in the universe of "Flowers for Princess Fischl," entropy begot destruction.In other words: The girl who loved to dream grew up.On her fourteenth birthday, those of her peers who refused to accommodate her quirks belittled her once again."This is but a minor setback for the noble princess. My parents will understand," she thought to herself.For if she knew one thing, it was that as a princess she could never surrender her nobility and dreams.But when she threw herself into her parents' arms in need of comfort, she was met instead with gentle words of exasperation."Amy, you are fourteen years old now. It's fun to make-believe, but eventually you need to grow up and put your childish dreams behind you..."And with that, the same voice that had once lit up her world now tore it apart.That day at midnight, she hid herself in the library she knew so well. She had a strange feeling that she was being watched... Suddenly, she heard an otherworldly flapping of wings.Sure enough, she looked up and her red, swollen eyes met with those of a night raven from another world.What transpired afterwards is another story...Fischl doesn't much like this story. Thinking about it causes her to feel suffocating pain and soul-devouring loneliness.Maybe one day, this story will be written. But that would be Amy's story, not Fischl's.Fischl has but one identity: she's the Prinzessin.As long as she remembers this simple and perfect logic, with a little bit of nobility and a touch of kindness from others, nothing can ever hurt her.Things are looking up for Prinzessin Fischl these days - not only does she have Oz, but she has finally met a traveler who, just like her, comes from a different world...
The novel series "Flowers for Princess Fischl" is available as a collectible set.Due the tiny numbers in circulation, it is a priceless commodity amongst loyal fans of the author.But no matter how elegant these works are aesthetically, their worldview remains incredibly bleak:Every good, bright and noble thing must eventually fall to inexorable entropic destruction, and the final destination of the universe is the realm-in-waiting of the Prinzessin, Immernachtreich.This is the fate of all worlds, of the universe, and all who live in it.And the Prinzessin and her loyal companion, the "Night-Severing Raven Oz," Ozvaldo Hrafnavins, are the World Beasts who will swallow all dreams.At the very end, at the end of karma itself, she will grant all the gathered souls her benediction, and use her Thundering Retribution to cleanse all that is ugly and wicked.The Prinzessin will then set her own heart ablaze, and the universe shall be born anew in its immortal light.But before all this can come to pass, the Prinzessin must first roam many universes, and see countless new sights.Thus it is perfectly within the spirit of the original work that the Prinzessin should be stuck as an investigator for the Adventurers' Guild in a slightly backward world. Just a little twist of fate, nothing more.The Prinzessin will come to understand someday that each moment of her life, no matter how insignificant their little twists could be, is to be treasured.After all, the Prinzessin's very own Phantasmagoria is made out of ones such as these.
So, is Oz just an imaginary friend who only exists as a figment of Fischl's subconscious?Our story begins with the royal heirloom, Edelstein der Dunkelheit - that is to say, Fischl's Vision.When her wish was acknowledged, the raven Oz and her Vision both appeared before her eyes.That night, at dinner, Oz got on most well with Fischl's parents:"Ah, mein Kaiser und Kaiserin der Verurteilung, forgive mine overstep, but the beans in your house are too delicious.""Oh, then please, help yourself. This is the first time little Amy has met a friend she can bring over for dinner since she turned fourteen. This is a special occasion.""W-What are you saying! I... One does not simply cavort with the plebeians!"-And that's what happened.For all intents and purposes, it seems that the Kaiser und Kaiserin der Verurteilung could both see Oz, and both believed Oz to be the Prinzessin's first friend.As for the "Bennett Adventurer Who Bears the World's Curses," the "Traveler Visitor From Outer Worlds" and the "Paimon Strange Fae-shaped Emergency Sustenance..."They would become the Prinzessin's new friends, though that would happen even further in the future.

<title>Kasala</title>
<text>Kasala was a historical figure in Sumeru who was one of the faithful priests of King Deshret. His voice can be heard narrating the penultimate cutscene that plays during the Secret of the Scorching Desert.
Profile
Kasala was one of the last priests to serve during the reign of King Deshret. He once presided over (and was later entombed in) the Mysterious Ruins temple, a quest-exclusive domain uncovered during the Secret of the Scorching Desert.
Kasala served under him during the period of great chaos that befell Sumeru after King Deshret, in his grief over the Nabu Malikata Goddess of Flowers' death and in pursuit of creating an eternal utopia for his people, exposed the land to forbidden knowledge, described as knowledge that "did not belong to this world." The knowledge would soon engulf Sumeru, leading to phenomena such as The Withering and Eleazar to spread across the land.
He and the other priests worked under the instruction of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata (who came to King Deshret's aid) to build new temples, which she would then imbue with the "divine power of life" (Dendro) in an attempt to stave off the corrosion caused by forbidden knowledge. Following these events, Kasala also bore witness to the self-sacrifice of King Deshret, who gave his life presumably in hopes that, as the originator of the forbidden knowledge, his death would open the way for its total eradication. Kasala also witnessed the near-total exhaustion of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's strength. which caused her to regress into the form of a small child.
After the death of his king, Kasala would continue to serve him by residing in the Mysterious Ruins temple for the remainder of his life, ultimately being entombed there.
Appearance
'(To be added.)'
Story
Kasala was one of the last priests chosen by King Deshret during the period of his reign and the subsequent collapse of his civilization, living roughly a thousand years before the events of the main story. Under the instruction of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, he and the other priests oversaw the construction of (and later presided over) new temples across the Great Red Sand in an attempt to delay the damage caused by the forbidden knowledge. After King Deshret's death, Kasala would continue to serve him by safe-guarding one of these temples, located in the Mysterious Ruins, until his own death. Kasala would be entombed there, and the temple would eventually be lost beneath the sands for an indeterminate amount of time before being inadvertently rediscovered due to a landslide caused by an earthquake.
In the final days or hours of his life, (either in an effort to preserve a true account of the events that he saw so they don't become lost, to serve as a cautionary tale for future generations, or as a means of preserving King Deshret's legacy) Kasala recorded a message (later discovered by Alhaitham) recounting the slow collapse of King Deshret's civilization. The message revealed that, contrary to the beliefs of many present-day The Eremites Eremites, King Deshret had never been betrayed by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata at all, and they instead worked together to stop the spread of forbidden knowledge, with King Deshret ultimately deciding to sacrifice himself to protect his people.Secret of the Scorching Desert</text>

<title>Tri-Commission</title>
<text>the Inazuman organizations the quest type Commission
The Sanbugyou or Tri-Commission ja=三 さん 奉 ぶ 行 ぎょう ja_rm=San-bugyou ja_tl=Three Commissioners is a collective term for three organizations which oversee every matter in Inazuma.A Path Through the Storm It is roughly equivalent to the Liyue Qixing and the Eight Trades in Liyue,While the English text of Atsuko during 'A Path Through the Storm' says it is equivalent to "the Eight Trades under the Liyue Qixing" (emphasis added), both the Chinese and Japanese equivalents of the line simply say "Qixing, Eight-Trades." as well as the Knights of Favonius in Mondstadt.
The Tri-Commission meets together at Tenshukaku to decide on government affairs. In the Archon Quest 'A Flower Blooms in a Prison', Kamisato Ayaka says that whenever the Yashiro Commission made a proposal to repeal the Vision Hunt Decree, it was promptly vetoed by both the Tenryou Commission and the Kanjou Commission. This implies the existence of some sort of council or committee where proposals must pass through, and that the Yashiro Commission cannot present their proposal directly to the Raiden Shogun. This is similar to the Hyojoshu ja=評定衆, the highest organ of government in the Tokugawa shogunate, which was a council comprised of the highest government officials and the bugyou.

<title>Bloodstained Knight</title>
<text>The Bloodstained Knight, formerly known as the White Knight, was a noble-born member of the Knights of Favonius that served under Arundolyn 500 years ago.Bloodstained Chivalry He was mentored by the Knights' second-in-command, Wolf Pup Rostam,Defender's Will who taught him chivalry, justice and swordsmanship,The Black Sword and as a result, became a powerful knight obsessed with justice. He also had a younger, blind brother who traveled different nations to follow his older sibling's footsteps but ultimately died in Sumeru.Deepwood Memories
The Black Sword was his weapon, while the artifact set Bloodstained Chivalry were once his possessions.
Story
While training with Rostam under the Knights of Favonius, Rostam instilled him the principles of chivalry, justice, and swordsmanship. Afterwards, the White Knight would often jump at the opportunity to correct any injustice he witnessed and on one such occasion he saved the maiden in Maiden Beloved who fell in love with him. She tried to give him various rewards, but he insisted chivalry was its own reward and only accepted a white flower from her.
Sometime during his many expeditions, the knight began to lose himself in the cutting down of his foes. He convinced himself that the feeling he was getting was satisfaction in justice being served and continued towards his goal of purging the world of evil. Another person tried to counsel him by telling him that slaughter in the sake of justice is still slaughter, but the knight didn't take their advice and continued on his path.
As the knight continued towards his goal, he became increasingly stained by blood from all the monsters he fought, changing the appearance of his sword, armor and accessories as they all became stained black. The people that he saved from monsters understandably fled in fear from him, seeing him as another monster.
He eventually came to the realization that there was no place left for him and went to Khaenri'ah an ancient fallen kingdom, intending to die in battle against the monsters there. However, he instead learned that the monsters were in fact the people of the fallen kingdom under a curse. He decides that this was the "ultimate injustice," and pledges himself to the Abyss.
At an unknown point in time after he had learned about "the crime of twisting man into a beast's form," the knight encountered the Viridescent Viridescent Venerer, who had been tainted by relentless slaughter of Abyssal beasts. Seeing her as no different from monsters, the knight killed her before continuing his westward journey to settle the previously mentioned crime.Hunter's Path</text>

<title>Parsifal the Great</title>
<text>the magician in Fontaine the fallen Mondstadt noble Parsifal the weapon whose passive is named Parsifal the Great The First Great Magic
Parsifal the Great, also written as the Great Magician "Parsifal" and simply Parsifal, was the alias of a Fontaine Fontainian woman who came from Fleuve Cendre. She lived before the cataclysm 500 years ago and was acquainted with several important Fontainian figures, including Eduardo Baker and Karl Ingold. She also had a sister, known by her alias "Josephine," whom she performed magic tricks with as a disguise for their thievery.The First Great Magic
Profile
Parsifal and Josephine's birth names are unknown and they adopted their stage names from one of Coppelius' plays, which was loosely based on the tale of Mondstadt's Parsifal and Blue-Eyed Spear Witch. They first began performing magic tricks at Eduardo's tavern and eventually became skilled enough that the two began performing in the aboveground Court of Fontaine, where they quickly became the talk of the town.
At some point in time following the Siege of Poisson, Parsifal committed an "unexpected transgression" which led her to request trial by combat. She had her last duel against the Champion Duelist Marfisa, whom she had history with.Moment of Judgment
Story
Parsifal and her sister Josephine were born in Fleuve Cendre, the impoverished underground sector of the Court of Fontaine. The two became thieves to survive, stealing from guests at the opera house, but became dazzled by the idea of standing onstage themselves. The two became the renowned magician and assistant duo, although Parsifal was better known than her sister.
During the purge of Fleuve Cendre, Josephine rushed back, only to find the destruction left in its wake. Josephine's whereabouts after that is left unaddressed, but Parsifal went on to join Eduardo during his takeover of Poisson. She was captured in Karl's photograph of the major figures at Poisson: Parsifal, Eduardo, Baker's son Jakob, Renault de Petrichor (then the mayor of Poisson), Renault's son Rene de Petrichor Rene, Rosa Reed (holding her unnamed infant son), Rosa's husband Thompson, and Tom Alter.Fleuve Cendre Ferryman
During the Poisson Siege of Poisson Siege of Poisson, Parsifal saved Karl's life; however, she was eventually brought before the court for her participation in the siege, where she requested trial by combat. She took up arms one last time against the Champion Duelist Marfisa and presumably died in the duel. Years later, while reminiscing on the past during a meeting with Basil Elton, Karl regretted that he never recorded Parsifal's final duel, having quit news journalism following the Siege of Poisson.</text>

<title>Blunt Attack</title>
<text>Blunt Attacks or Heavy Attacks refer to attacks that can damage Geo objects and certain Shields more significantly than others, as well as Frozen Shattered Shatter Frozen targets. These include:
*Claymore Attacks
*Plunging Attacks (Except Bow and Catalyst)
*Most Geo DMG
**Exceptions include Ningguang's Sparkling Scatter Plunging Attack, Gorou's Ripping Fang Fletching Charged Attack and Juuga: Forward Unto Victory Crystal Collapses, and Yun Jin's Opening Flourish.
***Note that non-Blunt Geo attacks can still trigger Shatter, but do not benefit from the increased effectiveness against Geo Constructs and Shields.
*Explosions
The term Blunt is used in the 'Genshin Impact' source code to indicate the Strike Type. Note that "Blunt" is a separate attribute from poise damage (though there is a tendency for Blunt attacks to have high poise damage, it is not necessarily true that having a high poise damage makes the attack "Blunt").

<title>Divine Nail</title>
<text>The divine nails,Amethyst Crown also referred to with a variety of terms such as needles, pillars, and spikes, are large objects resembling broken crystalline pillars found scattered in ancient ruins across Teyvat. These nails contain immense power and are capable of affecting the Ley Lines in the areas where they are located.Dragonspine's Glacial Secret s=Ancient Carvings
According to various legends, they were cast down by the Celestia the heavens to heal the land following the war between it and the Second Who Came, but they also devastated the mortal realm.Staff of the Scarlet Sands In the original world, the barriers were torn down, and the dark poison had penetrated the earth. To heal that fragile, sad, and imperfect world, the spikes descended and pierced through the earth's crust.Amethyst Crown "But the master of the heavens, consumed by fear for the rising tide of delusion and breakthroughs, sent down the divine nails to mend the land, laying waste to the mortal realm..."
Overview
So far, the divine nails have all taken the form of a broken pillar with a seemingly stone exterior, with a blue crystalline interior revealed through its broken end and the decorative motifs around the nail. At the top of the nail is a Symbols in Teyvat Celestial Motif celestial motif.
At Dragonspine and The Chasm: Underground Mines The Chasm, people who have undertaken research into the areas' strange environments have noted peculiarities of similar qualities, which relate back to the power of the divine nails. Dragonspine, which was once a lush mountain, has blue plants that proliferate around Ancient Rime.In the Mountains The Chasm, which is known for its ore, began spawning Lumenstone and Lumenspar after a fragment of its divine nail was discovered in one of the underground mines' caves.Find The Chasm Mining Records note=The Chasm Spiritstone Investigation Report These stones are capable of repelling Dark Mud, an Abyssal power, which also began emerging en masse after the discovery of the nail fragment. According to Nahida, the divine nails have the ability to purify and stabilize powers that shouldn't exist in Teyvat.What Shape Does the Self Hold Nahida: It has the ability to purify and stabilize powers that shouldn't exist in Teyvat.
Upon impact with the ground, the nail leaves behind a large crater in its wake, as evident in Liyue and Sumeru.
Story
Thousands of years ago, a war between the Primordial One and the Second Who Came caused the destruction of heaven and earth.Moonlit Bamboo ForestThe Byakuyakoku Collection In the aftermath, the heavens cast down the divine nails to mend the land and suppress the "dark poison" - highly implied to relate to the secrets of the skies and the Abyss - that the invaders had brought. However, this also had devastating effects on the civilizations that still existed on the mortal realm.
Dragonspine
Sal Vindagnyr, which was located on the mountain now known as Dragonspine, was once a lush and verdant area with a prominent Irminsul tree which the people revered. When the Skyfrost Nail descended, it landed over a ritual site at the summit of the mountain, now known as the Peak of Vindagnyr.Peak of Vindagnyr It not only froze the area over but also shattered the Irminsul tree, which the Princess of Sal Vindagnyr attempted to revive via grafting but failed to accomplish.Frostbearer For unknown reasons, the Skyfrost Nail splintered into shards which then scattered to three places around Dragonspine, one of which was the Irminsul.
Around a thousand years ago, towards the end of the Mondstadt Aristocracy era, a group of nobles attempted to restore their prestige by arranging an expedition to uncover Dragonspine's secrets. However, this expedition was sabotaged by Eberhart, who wished to overthrow the aristocracy, and none of its members made it back to Mondstadt.A Land EntombedRagged Records
By the time the Traveler explores Dragonspine, nobody had yet reached the summit on account of the Ancient Rime that blocked the paths to the summit. Over the course of 'In the Mountains', the Traveler frees the three shards from their icy encasements, which causes them to return to the main fragment at the summit. Each time, the jagged ice around the fragments also recedes into the earth after freeing the shards. After reaching the summit and thawing out the shards again, the nail is restored. The ice around the nail recedes and the nail ascends to the sky, revealing the Peak of Vindagnyr.
The Chasm
The Chasm's Spiritstone has an unknown relationship to the Solar Chariot, also known as the "heavenly star" legend to the people of Liyue, and little is revealed regarding the civilization in the depths of The Chasm besides the fact that it is older than Khaenri'ah.The Grave of the Guarded
In recent times, a fragment of the Spiritstone was discovered in Stony Halls, where miners who came in contact with it would begin having hallucinations in which their desires were granted, leading to this crystal to be dubbed the "Wishstone." Lumenstone and Lumenspar also began appearing en masse, while the physical structure of The Chasm's mines began changing as though alive. Alarmed by these turns of events, the Liyue Qixing ordered the closure of The Chasm and made an agreement with the Fatui to investigate the cause. Following the events of Archon Quest Chapter I, this agreement was annulled and the Qixing decided to lead their own investigation.
Over the course of 'The Chasm Delvers', the Traveler and the Chasm Exploration Team investigate the source of the anomalies in the mines. After freeing the Wishstone and following trails left behind by the Fatui Ninth Company's investigations, the Traveler makes their way to the Spiritstone, where they found it being bound by Abyssal power. Releasing the Spiritstone caused a Khaenri'ahn automaton, Haftvad the Worm, to emerge, which was only defeated after Yelan dislodged the Spiritstone and crushed the Ruin Serpent underneath it. After Haftvad's destruction, the Spiritstone floated back up, albeit to a lower altitude than before.</text>

Summary
The Two Musketeers' Triumph
After the suspects' arrests, the results for the winner of the Fontinalia Film Festival are preparing to be announced. Xavier asks the Traveler to fetch Cheveruse, who was busy escorting the accused to the Fortress of Meropide herself. The Traveler heads to the Administrative Area, where they find her talking to Wriothesley. She informs him about the three she would be bringing in; Wriothesley had not made any promises or guarantees regarding her "heads-up", though she also points out that he did not outright refuse her. Cheveruse, having sympathized with the siblings, asks Wriothesley to give everyone the latest copy of the Steambird when the case was revealed, which would make Baptiste and Veronique seen as heroes and Morris as the villain.
The three return to the venue just as the winner is announced; Xavier's "The Two Musketeers", who thanks his crew, the "Musketeer Pictures". Ayaka, having made a new friend in the form of Cheveruse, states that the city has exceeded her expectations. She then asks her if she would be willing to travel to her home nation of Inazuma, which Cheveruse accepts should she have the time. Chiori asks Ayato if he had accomplished everything he needed for the trip, which he confirms. She then asks about Ogura Textiles & Kimonos, pleased to hear that Ogura Mio is still doing well and asks him to send her regards. Finally, she learns that the A Nation Closed by Thunder thunderstorms surrounding Inazuma had gone, which Ayato confirms and that the islands are in peace and prosperity. Xavier then has Furina carry the Furina Award due to her invaluable assistance as a director, which she reluctantly does to avoid embarrassing herself.

<title>Erinnyes (NPC)</title>
<text>the historical character other uses Erinnyes (Disambiguation)
Erinnyes is a mentioned character and knight from the time of the Remuria Empire.
Profile
Erinnyes was a Lochknight and singer of Aremori Castle with "sea-colored eyes." She is known to have used a Splendor of Tranquil Waters sword in combat. She defeated the princes of Bellouacoi, Atrebatis, and Uiromanduoi and conquered their lands. She and her people worshipped Egeria, the "Mistress of Many Waters," as their god.La Chanson d'ErinnyesSplendor of Tranquil Waters
One day, King Remus sent an envoy inviting Erinnyes and her people to join Remuria and submit to the Sumphonia Capitolii (meaning "the eternal harmony"). The envoy asked for two gifts as tribute: water to wash away all sins and earth to resist the upcoming erosion; he also warned that Remus would retaliate and conquer their kingdom by force if they resisted. Erinnyes intended to send the envoy back to Remuria with a message to Remus affirming that her people worshiped only Egeria, and that they would not submit to his will. The envoy then stated that Remus was determined to conquer all the lands through war and plague, and that his ultimate goal was to unite everyone under his rule and save them from the upcoming prophecy. However, Erinnyes and her knights were determined to resist the invasion.
Along with the message to Remus, Erinnyes also instructed the messenger to tell Remus that she was to lead Egeria's army to vanquish the Vishap dragons and destroy the "white dragon" and the "Remuria Grand City", thus driving all the "invaders" from their land.
Erinnyes, under Egeria's banner, had fought dragons and was said that her knights were "bathed in the blood of Vishap dragons" as they welcomed the return of Egeria.Song of Days Past
During the time of the "song of harmony," Erinnyes unified the people of the high waters who rebelled against the gods. Her home and family were eventually destroyed by Remus' army. Only two people, Cassiodor and Erinnyes, escaped the death and enslavement that would befall the rest of their tribe. After this defeat, Erinnyes would return to Egeria; she was taken in by the Prince of Aremorica and tasked with guarding the waters not yet seized by Remuria.
Erinnyes eventually led a resistance against Remus' rule. At the same time, Scylla was also leading a resistance against Remuria consisting of vishaps and the barbarian tribes of Fontaine.page=Song of Stillness There is no information at this point to indicate Erinnyes and Scylla had collaborated in their resistance against Remus. At this time, Egeria had been sealed away by Celestia for "creating life" by using water from the Primordial Sea to give Oceanids human forms. Erinnyes searched high and low for the Pure Grail, an object she believed could free Egeria from her imprisonment; however, she was never able to find it. Instead, when Remuria finally fell, Celestia commanded Egeria to return from her primeval prison and take over Remus' position in ruling Fontaine.
After Egeria ascended as the Hydro Archon, Erinnyes begged Egeria to tell her how Fontaine's descendants could avoid the prophesied disaster. Egeria was moved by this plea, and told Erinnyes what she had once told Remus; however, this answer "[led] only to despair," and Erinnyes seemingly had her faith crushed. She threw down her sword and stumbled away from the valley, never to be seen again.
According to La Chanson d'Erinnyes, during her final meeting with Egeria, Erinnyes threw her sword into a lake three times, as the sword was stained with the blood of those she had slain in battle. In doing this, Erinnyes' wish was that one day somebody "seven times" more noble than she would use the sword to accomplish greater deeds.
Sword
Erinnyes' sword was called Hauteclaire, the Sword of Light, also known as the Splendor of Tranquil Waters. It was a water-blue scepter, an aqua-shaded sword stained with blood, with a golden hilt decorated with jewels. Originally, it was owned by Daeira, the maiden of the lake, who gifted the sword to Erinnyes, then the chief of knights. Erinnyes then used the sword to conquer Peiregord, Aisias and the "distant south", settling countless conflicts in peace.</text>

<title>Order of Skeptics</title>
<text>The Order of Skeptics or Shamaniyya, also known as the Nagarjunites by the Akademiya,The Splendorous Sky That Day are a group of scholars that can be found in the Girdle of the Sands in Sumeru. They were once a branch of Sumeru Akademiya,Darya but have long since split from them and are rarely acknowledged. The order believes in "the transmission of knowledge at all costs" and that "conflict is the natural order of Teyvat."
Leaders of the Order of Skeptics are known as Nasuraia (Vijnanapati), which is defined as "one who has epiphanies."Sumeru NasuraiaIn 'The Splendorous Sky That Day', "Vijnanapati" is given as the ruby characters for "Nasuraia." Normally, this means that "Nasuraia" is meant to be read as "Vijnanapati," or that the two terms are at least synonyms. Nagarjuna, the sage who led the scholars from Sumeru Akademiya to the Girdle of the Sands where the Order of Skeptics was founded, is considered the first leader of the Order.
Overview
The Order of Skeptics in the current day are descended from a group of Akademiya scholars led by a one-armed sage, who came to the desert to help the Pari defeat the Abyssal forces that had spilled out during the cataclysm. At this time, Khaenri'ah had already fallen, and Dainsleif had joined the Pari in the Vourukasha Oasis to fight the monsters. The one-armed sage used documents left behind by the Khaenri'ans to find a path to Harvisptokhm, where the Pari purified the defilement from the land. Afterward, the scholars who remained settled in the area, forged a bond with the Pari, and established themselves as the Order of Skeptics.The Hymn of Tir Yazad (Part 1)
Several centuries ago, an investigation team sent from the Akademiya came to the desert to explore the secrets of Khaenri'ah. Despite the Order's warning, they insisted on entering the Khaenri'an ruins, so the then-Vijnanapati sent a member from the Order, Klingsor, to accompany them. However, when he returned, he had embraced the Abyss and the investigation team was nowhere to be found. Afterward, the Vourukasha Oasis suffered many attacks from Abyssal monsters looking for the Great Songs of Khvarena, forcing Zurvan to seal the Oasis and the ruins. According to Zurvan, the Order never recovered from this incident, having lost all their ancient archives to fire. Since then, the Abyss has greatly affected the loyalties of the Order, to the point where its current-day Vijnanapati, Nasejuna, had allied with the Abyss to destroy Harvisptokhm so that the energy from the Abyss would envelop Teyvat. During the events of Khvarena of Good and Evil, Nasejuna's attempt to seize the Songs from the Traveler by force failed, and he was forced to flee, leaving the Order of Skeptics currently leaderless.
20 years ago, Kaveh's Father requested to join an investigative research project in the desert to help Aaru Village and find the Order of the Skeptics, although his exact association with the latter is never explained.The ContestantA Whole New Style

<text>The Latin-Based Language ('unofficial name'), popularly known as the Abyss Language ('unofficial name'), can be found all over Teyvat, usually in non-mundane inscriptions such as those relating to gods, alchemy, astrology, and in association with Ley Lines; it also appears when magical seals appear, such as on some chests. The alphabet is based on Latin alphabet Latin letters like the common written language of Teyvat, but the words and grammar are based on Classical Latin instead of English. Although there is no capitalization, there is punctuation.NGA:  (Reddit: ) Additionally, some versions of this alphabet are associated with the Abyss Order - and it may be that this was the script of Khaenri'ah.A Herald Without AdherentsPerils in the Dark

Special Forms
The glyphs of this alphabet are divided into top and bottom halves by a thin but deliberate gap. Typically, the full glyph is used, however in some cases, only half of the glyph is shown or only half of the glyph is relevant.
*The event menu for Unreconciled Stars uses only the bottom half of the glyphs.
*In the quest A Herald Without Adherents, two lines of text use only the top half of the glyphs, with one being inverted.
* In the Secret Messages in The Chasm secret messages found in The Chasm: Underground Mines, only the bottom half of the glyphs should be read:The top half of the glyph is changed systematically. Specifically, the alphabet is divided into five-letter sets (with six letters for the last set) and first letter of the set uses an inverted top half of the last letter of the set, the second letter of the set uses an inverted top half of the second-last letter of the set, and so on. This results in, for example, the letters A, B, C, D, and E having an inverted top half of the letters E, D, C, B, and A for their top halves respectively, while the bottom halves remain the same.

<title>Schwanenritter</title>
<text>The Schwanenritter were an order of knights from Khaenri'ah prior to the fall of the Eclipse Dynasty and the cataclysm. They were presumably led by Knight Marshal Anfortas, who claimed the position of Marshal Regent after Irmin King Irmin was left "indisposed" to deal with the cataclysm.
Notably, the Schwanenritter fought against the Abyssal monsters that attacked Khaenri'ah when the cataclysm struck, and continued to do so after bringing Khaenri'ahn citizens aboveground to Sumeru. As a result, the sage Nagarjuna and his followers, who would later become the Order of Skeptics, called them "heroes of Dahri."
Overview
We Schwanenritters have fought to the last one.|Knight Marshal Anfortas
King Irmin used knowledge from "beyond the skies" to create machines which could defy this world's laws. This knowledge, which was very likely forbidden knowledge, eventually culminated in an onslaught of dark beasts which ravaged Khaenri'ah. Around this time, Irmin was left incapable of ruling, so Anfortas declared himself Regent and took Irmin's place at the Regnum Concilium Ultimum.Interactable: Gavireh Lajavard Barely-Legible Bulletin Barely-Legible Bulletin

The Ruin Golem (Valley of Dahri) Ruin Golem in the Valley of Dahri experienced an inherent mechanical design defect while in the desert and became unstable. Without the proper replacement parts or the ability to manufacture more, the Schwanenritter could only salvage parts and keep the weapons systems functional for their continued fight. The golem continued to degrade, until eventually its smart boot systems became inoperable and its mobility was greatly hindered. It was abandoned in the desert to await eventual retrieval. Parts were salvaged to assist in the continued operation of the final Ruin Golem (Devantaka Mountain) Ruin Golem on Devantaka Mountain.Interactable: Zandik's Legacy Akademiya Investigation Team's Interim Report Akademiya Investigation Team's Interim Report Around the Valley of Dahri area, Hadura - now a Knight Commander - led a successful operation against the dark beasts which earned them the epithet "Sentinel of the Golden Hall," bestowed by Anfortas.Afratu's Dilemma note=optional interactable Old Orders Old Orders: ...Knight Commander Hadura, who has successfully led the operation to stall the beasts, is hereby conferred the title of "Sentinel of the Golden Hall"...
The Schwanenritter's final Ruin Golem made it to Devantaka Mountain.

This left only Hadura and Anfortas remaining.
For unknown reasons and in unknown circumstance, Hadura "betrayed" the other Schwanenritter, sabotaging and destroying "a machine." Anfortas carried out Hadura's execution and lost his left eye in the ensuing fight, but still gave Hadura a knight's funeral since they were the last remaining member besides himself. With the Schwanenritter down to the last man, Anfortas continued to fight alone until his own presumed death.Cryptic Message in Sumeru
Legacy
Unbeknownst to Anfortas, Ynghildr did not perish in the fight against the beasts of the Abyss, but was instead corrupted and became a Shadowy Husk. She returned to the fallen Golem, where she remained guarding the control module of the semi-operational ruin golem until the Traveler defeats her during the Vimana Agama: Jazari's Chapter. When Jazari learns of their encounter, he dismisses the idea that a Khaenri'ahn could have lived for such a long time.
Hadura's relatives presumably followed Nagarjuna back to the Girdle of the Sands and became members of the Order of Skeptics. Klingsor, a member of the Order hundreds of years ago, called Hadura his ancestor.Interactable: Records of Unknown Attribution Records of Unknown Attribution (I) Records of Unknown Attribution (I)

<title>God</title>
<text>Gods zh=神 zh_rm=Shén are beings from the Human Realm with great control over elemental energy and whose lifespans are much longer than that of mortals. Most gods on Teyvat are beholden to Celestia, although several gods have displayed wariness or even resentment towards the heavenly citadel.
Before the Archon War, many gods roamed the continent of Teyvat. For reasons unknown, seven divine seats opened up in Celestia,Treasure Lost, Treasure Found (Part 1)Treasure Lost, Treasure Found (Part 2) causing the continent to descend into a protracted series of conflicts that ended 2000 years ago. Over the course of the war, most gods were slain or sealed until only seven victors remained; each victor became their respective element's Archon and became the rulers of one of the seven nations,It is currently unclear whether the seven nations' territories were already determined before the start of the Archon War or not. using their powers to transform its terrain and governing the land according to their ideals.
Overview
Very little is currently known about the origins of gods. As evidenced by Andrius and Barbatos, gods can be elevated from a lower existence and given powers from another god.Andrius Morax, Raiden Makoto, and Raiden Ei's origins have been left a mystery, and have presently been referred to as gods since the start of their recorded histories.
In the past, gods were expected to have a love for humanity, and use their powers as gods to guide and protect humanity; Andrius, who held a low opinion of human society, was viewed as an oddity.Boreal Wolf's Milk ToothBoreal Wolf's Nostalgia However, after The Seven were established and its original members passed on, the newer archons no longer upheld the duty of guiding humanity.
Gods cannot be completely destroyed - even if a god's physical form is destroyed, their consciousness is worn away, and they are considered "dead," their emotions and power remain effective. Havria's relics kept their special properties thousands of years after her death and were ultimately thrown into the ocean by Zhongli so that humanity would not seek the power of a long-dead deity. Gods who place their power into the land, such as Andrius and Marchosius, may be considered "dead" but can continue manifesting in the world afterwards,Three to Get Ready, and Here We Go although how this works is currently unclear.Andrius is explicitly stated to have died but can manifest himself at Wolvendom to answer a challenge and is fully conscious with his memories intact. Marchosius was only described as having entered a deep slumber, but he manifested at the shrine while Xiangling was asleep with the suggestion that he was not present when she entered the shrine. As a result of placing his power into the land, Marchosius also lost most of his mental faculties and is no longer capable of speech, unlike Andrius.
Upon death, a god's power flows out of their body and into the surrounding environment. The consequences of a god's death vary greatly, so what determines the result is currently unclear. Andrius was able to control the flow of power and use it to the benefit of the land when he voluntarily chose death.Spirit Locket of Boreas The power released upon Havria's death salinized her adherents and Sal Terrae was sealed off afterwards,Farewell, Sweet Salt but the region as a whole has shown no ill effects following her death. Meanwhile, a god's hatred will have negative effects on the surrounding environment and the people who reside there; for example, the Tatarigami on Yashiori Island afflicted inhabitants of the island with mysterious diseases and drove others to insanity. Wildlife that comes across the remains of a god and consumes it enough will mutate and transform into a Consecrated Beast.
The Seven have come up with various ways of counteracting such effects, such as the Yakshas in Liyue who fight against the power of ancient gods,HoYoLAB:  and the wards around Inazuma used to suppress the likes of Tatarigami and Kanna Kapatcir's power.
Story
Ancient History
Based on current knowledge, most if not all gods came into being after the establishment of the Human Realm and hold the Human Realm's power, making them incompatible with the Light Realm and Void Realm's powers under normal circumstances.The Byakuyakoku Collection Elemental dragons hold power equal to a god's.Breeze Amidst the Forest
Archon War
Archon War
The Archon War was a prolonged conflict between gods for supremacy that began several thousand years ago and ended two thousand years ago. The war allegedly began over the seven divine thrones which opened up in Celestia, which may coincide with the creation of the Gnosis Gnoses following the "great war of vengeance" which greatly weakened the Primordial One.
The Guili Assembly, established by Guizhong and Rex Lapis in Guili Plains in the distant past, was one civilization destroyed during the chaos of the Archon War. Shortly after the fall of the Guili Assembly 3,700 years ago, Rex Lapis and the adepti gathered the survivors and took them south of Mt. Tianheng, where Liyue Harbor was established.Stone Tablet Compilations: Vol. I Some time afterwards, Havria was murdered by her own people for being weak, and the survivors of Sal Terrae were scattered across Liyue. Rex Lapis subdued countless other gods and monsters, including Osial, Chi, and Orobashi, the latter whom survived and fled to Inazuma.Orobashi narrates in Oathsworn Eye Lore Oathsworn Eye's description that it was defeated by the "Golden God" zh=贵金之神. The Chinese term was later used in Neuvillette's Neuvillette Voice-Overs About the Geo Archon "About the Geo Archon" Voice-Over, although it was localized into English as "Deus Auri."
2600 years ago, in the midst of the Archon War, the God of Blizzards Andrius warred against the God of Storms, Decarabian. In their bitter stalemate, Barbatos challenged Decarabian for the freedom of Decarabian's people and emerged victorious. After Decarabian's death, Barbatos became the new Anemo Archon, while Andrius decided himself unfit for the position and chose to pass on instead, using his winds to nurture the new Mondstadt that Barbatos created.
In Inazuma, the twin gods Raiden Makoto and Raiden Ei emerged victorious, with Makoto assuming the position of Electro Archon and her sister sharing many of her duties while acting as her kagemusha.
Around 2000 years ago, the Archon War drew to a close as the seventh and final victor claimed their seat. These victors were thereafter known as the Seven Archons, and came to possess one of the Gnosis Gnoses as well as a portion of the elemental Authority for their element. Gods who refused to live under their rule fled to islands within the Dark Sea, regions beyond the control of The Seven, where they became evil gods.Bit of Aerosiderite
Of the seven victors of the Archon War, only two remain by the start of the game's story: Barbatos and Rex Lapis.YouTube: Solitary Fragrance While Raiden Ei was present during the Archon War, she did not assume the position of Electro Archon until her twin sister Makoto perished during the cataclysm 500 years ago. Most of The Seven's current members replaced the original founders of Teyvat's seven nations, with the current Dendro Archon Lesser Lord Kusanali as the newest of them at 500 years old.
Present Day
Among The Seven, each Archon is associated with and worshipped by one of Teyvat's seven nations. Most of a nation's elemental environment is based on its Archon's element, although areas affected by divine nails, such as Dragonspine, the Great Red Sand, and Tsurumi Island tend to be noticeably different from their surroundings.
An Archon's power is directly tied to their level of control over their nation. As a result, Venti - who travels as a bard and refuses to directly control the people of Mondstadt - is, by his own admission, extremely weak by Archon standards.Abyss Mage (Quest)
When a person's powerful wish reaches the heavens, Archons are obligated to give that person a Vision, which is a shard of the elemental Authorities and allows the recipient to manipulate elemental energy. Vision wielders are known as "allogenes" and are also privileged with the chance of rising to godhood.Ending Note In the year that the Vision Hunt Decree was in effect in Inazuma, no new Electro Visions appeared throughout Teyvat, leading scholars to conclude that the Archons' wills play a role in Vision distribution.Endless Research However, Ei is surprised to hear of this phenomenon herself and refutes the scholars' conclusion.

<title>Viridescent</title>
<text>the historical character the artifact set Viridescent Venerer
Viridescent, also known as the Viridescent Venerer and the Queen of Hunters, was a figure who lived five hundred years ago during the cataclysm.Viridescent VenererThe Viridescent Hunt
She was the original wielder of The Viridescent Hunt and later, Hunter's Path. The artifact set Viridescent Venerer focuses on her, and her story is expanded on in some pieces of the artifact set Deepwood Memories.
Profile
Viridescent, the Queen of Hunters, was among notable figures who fought against the Abyssal monsters that invaded Teyvat during the cataclysm after the fall of Khaenri'ah. She was brought into the conflict after slaying the monster that had mortally wounded a blind, dying boy. Taking up his last request to enact revenge on the monsters in his place, she abandoned her former way of life and became a feared monster hunter.
Story
Viridescent was orphaned at a young age and was raised in the woods by Viaghara, who taught her how to live with nature and how to hunt. She killed solely for the sake of survival and believed that at the end of her life, as long as she abided by the natural order, she would one day arrive at an endless viridescent plain. Having been raised away from human society, Viridescent was unable to speak human language, but was particularly astute at blending in with nature.
Viridescent's way of life was interrupted by the cataclysm. Greater Lord Rukkhadevata died during the disaster, causing the grass and the trees to "never speak again," while monsters of the Abyss began invading Teyvat. A certain blind boy got lost in the forest while pursuing the trail of his Bloodstained Knight white-armored brother.Scholar of VinesHunter's Path The boy discovered a relic of the forest, a bow made with white branches now known as Hunter's Path, which he gave to Viridescent. However, he was fatally injured by the monsters and Viridescent encountered him as he lay dying. For the first time, she killed not for survival, but as revenge for what they had done to him.Viridescent Arrow Feather At his request, she embarked on the path of vengeance against the monsters and the suffering they caused.
Having departed from the hunter's rule of killing only for the sake of survival and not for mortal reasons such as justice or revenge, Viridescent believed she would no longer be able to enter the endless plain at the end of her life. However, she remained undeterred and continued her path of vengeance, though she left behind her original bow, The Viridescent Hunt, so it would not be tainted by her quest.
During her quest to slay monsters, Viridescent underwent erosion, forgetting about her original reason for fighting and even the blind boy himself. Tainted by the black blood of the beasts she slew,Labyrinth Wayfarer There was one who remained and walked between the trees, eventually forgetting time itself amidst the hunt for wild beasts, becoming drenched in black blood. she became more and more beastlike herself. The Bloodstained Knight eventually found her on his westward journey and, seeing her as a monster, killed her.</text>

<title>Faruzan/Lore</title>
<text>A distinguished Akademiya scholar from "a century ago" and one of the founders of Ancient Mechanics as a field of study. Although she hailed from Haravatat, she was renowned for her talents in machinery throughout Sumeru... Even though these honors have been forgotten in the river of time, much as she has.
Personality
A researcher from "one hundred years ago." She enjoys self-identifying as everyone's senior, and has significant knowledge of ancient scripts and machines of all kinds.
Despite being a Haravatat scholar, Faruzan specializes more in the Kshahrewar studies, being highly knowledgeable in machine mechanics and language. She's highly respected in the Kshahrewar school for her contributions, but she still remains a Haravatat scholar and refuses any attempts to join Kshahrewar. Due to technically living longer than others in part due to the King Deshret ruins she had been trapped in, she self-identifies as a senior despite her youthful appearance and demands respect from them. While proud and a bit stubborn, Faruzan does secretly struggle with coming to terms with her circumstances since her old friends and family had passed on in her absence as many believed her to be dead.
Due to the circumstances involved in her entombment, many people tend to see her thesis and points being outdated. As a result of her supposedly "outdated" research, Faruzan has issues acquiring Mora, which frequently baffles and irritates her. She becomes extremely delighted when offered a large amount of payment.
Appearance
Pristine Elegance
Faruzan uses the Medium Female Characters medium female model. She has fair skin, and her hair is a turquoise gradient, from pale turquoise at the roots to a darker turquoise at the ends. She has messy bangs that frame the sides of her face, and her hair is cut short except for two locks of hair that mimic twin tails. Her eyes are a pale shade of blue and are partially golden, and her pupils are interestingly heterochromic and triangle-shaped; her right eye is a pale shade of Aquamarine and her left eye is a dark shade of Indigo.
Official Introduction
Faruzan: Simple machines, mysterious world
"Much of the content found within this book originates from Madam Faruzan's theories and manuscripts. It is our hope that future generations of scholars will remember her name when she returns to the Akademiya."
There is a legend circulating among the Kshahrewar students:
If you have failed your mechanics exams and do not dare ask for remedial lessons from your displeased tutor, you can make your way to Haravatat next door and ask Madam Faruzan for some tips.
There is no need to prepare a gift. Just remember to show sincerity and humility, and call her "Madam" respectfully. That will be sufficient to get into the living encyclopedia of mechanics' good graces.
Madam Faruzan's explanations are simple to understand yet insightful, and her in-depth knowledge really makes people wonder if she had a hand in writing the syllabus. Her guidance will help resolve the most daunting problems, though there remain two problems that all students must overcome on their own:
The first is how to hide their surprise when they see her youthful appearance.
The second is to refrain from asking her why she has been shunned in Haravatat despite having such erudition, and whether she should consider joining Kshahrewar.
If you are unfortunate enough to commit one of these faux pas, you shall bear witness to rhetoric worthy of a household name in Haravatat, especially when in the field of criticizing and reprimanding others.
Character Stories
If you were to open any Kshahrewar textbook, you will find Faruzan's record penned proudly upon the author page."Faruzan, outstanding researcher of the Sumeru Akademiya Akademiya, winner of the Sumeru Puzzlers' League Lifetime Achievement Award, one of the seminal scholars of Ancient Mechanics."But if you were to talk to Haravatat students about their choices, they frown as they speak of Faruzan's current state."Oh, you mean her... Well, her research is... obsolete, and there's no way it'll pass review, so you might as well find another mentor."Such reviews, as disparate as heaven and earth, arouse one's curiosity as a matter of course.And when asked by her juniors, Madam Faruzan often wears an inscrutable look."Hmm? You mean to ask what happened these past hundred years? And how things came to this pass? Ah, but this is a secret most great. Come closer, and I shall tell you. Yes, yes, closer..."-And then she gives them a good conk on the head."First! That curiosity of yours is best served in your studies. And secondly! You shall remember to call me 'Madam'!"
For many researchers at the Akademiya, Faruzan, who has been one of their number since a century prior, has always been a legendary figure.In her brief academic career, she was able to analyze over half the ruins within Sumeru's borders, thereby greatly lowering the difficulty of various further analyses into them and their machinery.The manuscripts and theses she left behind have laid firm foundations for all researchers who would come after, lighting the way for the countless Kshahrewar researchers' pursuit of knowledge.Her "end" would also add several layers of mystique to her legendary life, for she would disappear under mysterious circumstances while exploring some ruins, and would never be heard from again.Each retelling of her tale would grow ever more mysterious with regard to her disappearance.Some claim that she came into contact with King Deshret's ancient knowledge and was secretly imprisoned within the Temple of Silence.Others said that her intellect that had been acknowledged by the gods, and that she had been brought up to the heavens to dwell with them.After all, people generally believed that a legendary figure should have an equally legendary end.Thus did the tale drift further and further from the truth."So I made a miscalculation while solving a puzzle, and got trapped in the ruins. What? Is there a rule that says that senior researchers aren't allowed to mess up?"
What may come as a surprise to many younger researchers is that though Faruzan has made great contributions to the study of mechanics, she is in fact a member of Haravatat, which specializes in the study of languages.Simply put, her field of study is "the analysis of the structure of and solutions to various ruin devices via the study of stone carvings and other ancient texts."A century ago, the Akademiya's studies into Ancient Mechanics were not yet mature. As such, Faruzan's ability to prejudge the operations of such machines was indeed of great benefit to the act of exploring ruins.However, as the number of as-yet-unexplored ruins grew fewer and fewer, and the Kshahrewar's understanding of mechanics grew more advanced, this field of research would slowly lose the luster of yesteryear.By the time Faruzan re-entered the Akademiya a century later, no student in Haravatat could even understand her essays, and the mentors could only look at each other in dismay at the topics she would submit for study.On the other hand, there are many students in Kshahwerar who, having graduated on the back of manuscripts she had written and hearing of her present plight, have come to persuade her to join their Darshan instead, only to see little success in that matter.A certain researcher even went a bridge too far in their persuasion, making such claims as "in the future, Kshahrewar will be the only Darshan that can do research into machines!" and "the era of interpreting ancient texts is over!" This person wound up being chastised by an irate Faruzan for as long as it would take to sit through two entire classes.They say that that evening, this poor researcher would be nursing some alcohol in Lambad's Tavern, aghast and humbled in equal measure.A friend of his from Haravatat spent the whole night consoling him, while plotting in his heart to debate this old fogey and show her what for.Alas, Lambad's Tavern would have a new inconsolable drunk the very next day.
Apart from having her topics rejected during review, Faruzan's other major headache is finding a student after her own heart.Each time she plans a lecture at Haravatat, the students in the audience either scratch their heads or struggle not to fall asleep as they are subjected to a veritable barrage of mechanics jargon.In a fury, Faruzan will hurl her pointer and begin lambasting her old colleagues in Haravatat for failing in their duties as teachers and training such a generation of juniors.Her fury only grows when she realizes that the students pay more attention to her criticisms of folk from the previous century than her explanations of the principles of mechanics.And when students who have a mind to study mechanics hear that Madam Faruzan would like them to join her, they often express gratitude initially, only to waffle and claim that they must reconsider when they realize, conflict clear on their faces, that it is Haravatat to which they must go.Of course, Faruzan never hears these "considerations" - the next time they meet, that student will have already joined Kshahrewar.But there was once, when Faruzan had accepted Tighnari's invitation to investigate some rainforest ruins, when she happened upon the humblest of prayers as she walked: "Oh, great Dendro Archon, please help me learn words faster!"Those words were spoken sadly yet earnestly, and even Faruzan was moved: To think that Sumeru still played host to people with such a passion for the written word!That voice did not seem to belong to a child who had yet to read or write, nor did it sound like a researcher of Satyavada Life. And yet this must have been a person of some skill, for normal folk would not be able to delve this deep into the forest alone. Perhaps this person might even have some experience in dealing with machines in the forest.Following a brief moment of consideration, Faruzan concluded that this was a student of suitable age, fitting direction, and excellent quality - someone worth taking on as a disciple for sure. So decided, she revealed her presence from behind a tree.Having thought that there was no one about, Collei squeaked in surprise, the sound echoing through the woods.Tighnari was quick to the rescue, however, and following a stammering explanation from Collei (supplemented with interjections from Tighnari), this most major of misunderstandings was cleared up.With time, Faruzan would reacquaint herself with this young trainee Forest Ranger and get to know her better, even bringing her delicious food every time she visits Gandharva Ville.However, Collei has realized, to her consternation, that the resolution of the misunderstanding has only made Madam Faruzan... more eager to take her on as a student.Surely there must be lots of Akademiya students who "respect their teachers and their teachings" and "devote themselves to diligence," no?Perhaps even Faruzan has not realized that there is one other thing about Collei that has attracted her attention:That despite having experienced inhuman suffering, she has nonetheless been able to gain the strength to face life.
Even Faruzan herself cannot speak very articulately about the century in which she was trapped within the ruins, for her memories of it are very foggy.The ruins' origin? Unknown. Its location? Unknown. All she remembers is that it was related to King Deshret's civilization and filled from wall to wall with mechanisms and secret inscriptions.The mysterious power within the ruins had kept her body in a state of stasis, knowing neither hunger nor physical fatigue, yet not wholly able to shake off mental wear.She expended all the writing material she had on hand, yet could not translate a single line of text; used up a lifetime's worth of knowledge, yet could not unlock a single device.Lying amidst a mountain of manuscript paper, she stared blankly at the cipher-text on the ceiling.They mocked her, these legacies of an ancient deity - scorned her ignorance and the pettiness of the modern person.Did all she had studied and prided herself upon, did the painstaking research done by generations of scholars truly matter so little in the face of this ancient civilization?Faruzan got up from the ground, picked up a piece of smashed stone, and continued carving upon the tiles.As long as there was life, there was hope. What was unknown today could be learned tomorrow. Civilizations that existed could continue to evolve. Solutions unreached by the people of today would be uncovered by those who would come after.Even if this was to be her grave, she would leave some deductions and trial-and-error records behind to grant the next unfortunate, trapped soul some chance of escape.This was the spirit of scholarship - this was why researchers existed in the first place.After who knows how long, the entire floor, as far as she could touch it, had been filled with the symbols of obscure deductions.After that indeterminate time, her memories began to grow fuzzy and her consciousness faded, and she began to mutter words none could comprehend.And at one point - she knew not when - she finally found a way to solve the enigma.In her addled state, she did not yet realize that the true struggle still awaited her, beyond the walls of those ruins.
Faruzan would have to recuperate for quite some time after her escape to regain consciousness.Seeing Sumeru vastly changed from what she remembered, Faruzan almost believed that she was still within the ruins, trapped in some kind of illusion-generated device.It was not until someone from the Akademiya came to confirm her identity using past records within Akasha and explained the changes the world had undergone during this time that Faruzan began to slowly accept that time had indeed passed.That researcher brought her a Kshahrewar book, and as she cracked it open, she found this written on the title page:"Much of the content in this book came from Madam Faruzan's treatises and manuscripts. We hope that her name will still be remembered by future generations of students when she returns."As Faruzan read this text, organized by old friends of hers, she felt as if she could almost see her classmates again, talking and chatting about their futures. Yet this was already something from a century ago.The people she knew, the people who knew her... they were all no longer here.She had returned to Sumeru indeed, but it was as if she had drifted to some strange land instead.Even wayfarers adrift may return to their home, but she had been left unmoored on time's ocean, and there was no returning to the past.The poor researcher at her side was trying to pick and choose their words such that they might inquire as to what had happened to this senior from times past without touching any sore spots.Faruzan closed her book in silence before speaking of those past events in an even tone."-It was just a failed experiment. Such things happen to us researchers, don't they?"No matter the location, situation, or generation, time would never stop for Faruzan again.
This multi-purpose ruin exploration auxiliary support terminal, code-named "Vairambhaka," is one of the few projects that Faruzan was able to successfully secure funding for from the Akademiya following her return.This device can perform escort, monster dispersal, sand-clearing, and various other tasks. As per her usual preferences, it also contains various components that can be pressed interactively to relieve boredom.Unexpectedly, this travel essential actually wound up attracting the attention of a group of matra. They barged into her workshop without explanation and began to look the Vairambhaka up and down.Upon discovering its many seemingly useless components, their suspicions were aroused further, and ignoring Faruzan's protests that they "were just for stress relief," they planned on taking her latest work apart to examine it carefully.Fortunately, the General Mahamatra, Cyno, arrived in time to stop them.As it turned out, they suspected that Faruzan had been reticent about her mysterious disappearance on account of some nefarious secret.They also believed that she had refused to join Kshahrewar so that she could use Haravatat's lack of expertise in mechanics to build something dangerous.After all, few are the researchers who have not been seduced by the ominous knowledge that King Deshret's civilization had gained access to. As such, they came flocking the moment they heard that Faruzan was making some machine, as if to fight some terrible foe.Cyno, armed with records related with Faruzan, was able to dispel their doubts one by one, before apologizing to Faruzan for his subordinates' trespass, leaving one of them to help clear up the mess.Faruzan, who was just suffering from a lack of manpower right at that moment, was quite satisfied indeed with that arrangement. Quite liking this General Mahamatra's style, she invited Cyno to give this new machine a name.Cyno thought for a moment before saying that since it could stir up strong winds and had a connection with the matra, she could call it the "Great Vayuvyastra."Faruzan's puzzlement at that could easily rival that which she had shown in the ruins belonging to King Deshret.Fortunately, one of the matra came to her rescue, mentioning that Kshahrewar already possessed a machine with the same name, thus saving them all what would come if she were to inquire about the "deeper meaning" behind such a name.Later, having done her own independent study into how that name was formed, Faruzan would come up with her own name for her newest work - and thus, the Vairambhaka Gear was born.</text>

<title>Eula/Lore</title>
<text>A rebellious descendant of the old aristocracy who is always out on the battlefield.As one born into the old aristocracy, carrying the bloodline of sinners, Eula has needed a unique approach to the world to navigate the towering walls of prejudice peacefully. Of course, this did not prevent her from severing ties with her clan. As the outstanding Spindrift Knight, she hunts down Mondstadt's enemies in the wild to exact her unique "vengeance."
Personality
The Spindrift Knight, a scion of the old aristocracy, and the Captain of the Knights of Favonius Reconnaissance Company. The reason for which a descendant of the ancient nobles might join the Knights remains a great mystery in Mondstadt to this very day.
Eula is a descendant of Mondstadt's old aristocracy, being from the now-overthrown Lawrence Clan infamous for their tyrannical rule over Mondstadt. She dislikes people who view her similarly to the rest of her clan due to this mistrust, which has not been forgotten. She has a habit of declaring and getting "vengeance" against her enemies to redeem her family name. She is one of the few Lawrence Clan nobles who realize that their actions against the people of Mondstadt were unjustified and does not care about her family's past. As a young child, she was forced by her family to learn noble etiquette as part of an educational regime so harsh that it is considered borderline abusive.
Although Eula considers most of her clan's customs despicable, she personally enjoys the traditional "Dance of Sacrifice" and incorporates it into her style of "Favonius Bladework." She has a strained relationship with her family, who denounce her as a traitor for leaving the clan.Through the Motions, to the Heart She has stated that she would not hesitate to destroy her own family if they endangered Mondstadt, even finding it fitting, though she does care for them, mostly by ensuring that any of their plans to restore the family name weren't excessive. While she still tends to act like a clan noble on the outside, inside she is actually a kind-hearted person, echoed by both Amber and Sara. She is good friends with Yanfei after saving her from the Abyss Order, who compares her similarly in the way that they're both not bound by convention and solve problems their own way.
Despite her family's infamous history, her acquaintances consider her a reliable ally and friend with a unique sense of humor, and they have grown to understand that her controversial statements are but a product of her personality. The Knights under her command also support her unconditionally. Whenever someone points out something to her that she doesn't want to admit, she either raises her chin or puts her hands on her hips.
Appearance

Official Introduction
Severing a Sinner's Shackles With a Whirling Dance
The Knights of Favonius values one's abilities and deeds more than their background and lineage. Eula is indeed an outstanding knight, and there is no need to hold her identity as a descendant of the ancient nobles against her.
As the Captain of the Knights of Favonius Reconnaissance Company and the renowned Spindrift Knight, Eula spends most of her time out in the wild and has won much acclaim leading her team of scouts on patrol. The knights stationed in the mountains and valleys are often the target of sneak attacks from monsters, but Eula has always been able to resolve these crises by rendering swift support. She has also led proactive attacks to destroy Abyss Order strongholds time and again, nipping their nefarious plots in the bud.
Due to Eula's background, many contradictions surround her - she is a descendant of the Lawrence Clan Lawrence clan and is considered by the citizens of Mondstadt to be the embodiment of the blood of sinners. Despite everything, she severed ties with her clan many years ago and joined the Knights of Favonius. Yet prejudice is not so easily dispelled, and Eula has not been treated fairly. In the eyes of Mondstadt's citizens, she remains an "outsider," or even a "dangerous individual."
Years of such experiences have led Eula to build an invisible shield to protect herself from unwarranted harm. The term "vengeance" is perhaps the most visible edge of this shield. Only by disregarding wild gossip and trying to accept the logic of her approach to the world can one come to understand the truth behind the complex shell of this young woman.
Character Stories
Eula's role within the Knights of Favonius is Captain of the Reconnaisance Company.The nature of her work means that she rarely sets foot in the city - she spends most of her time out in the wild, leading her team of scouts as they hunt down Abyss Order operatives and other monsters.Known as the Spindrift Knight, Eula wields her blade with consummate skill, but perhaps more importantly, she is well-versed in strategy and possesses great courage and excellent intuition. Grand Master Varka had nothing but the highest praise for her, even declaring once that she was the Dandelion Knight's equal on the battlefield.On the face of it, to have two such outstanding knights attending to the defense of Mondstadt in a single generation should be a cause for nothing but celebration. But dig a little deeper and there is a fundamental difference between Jean and Eula.For Eula is a descendant of the once-Mondstadt Aristocracy aristocratic Lawrence Clan. The blood that flows through her veins once flowed through those of Mondstadt's oppressors during one of the darkest periods of the city's history.Consequently, Eula has been viewed with contempt by the citizens of Mondstadt since birth. The Lawrence name stands for a legacy of depravity and despotism that stains Mondstadt's past and scars the minds of its citizens even to this day.So, whenever Eula appears, old wounds resurface. People despise the aristocracy, and this does no favors for her reputation.However, Eula is strong-willed and in spite of everything, she joined the Knights of Favonius and rose to the rank of Captain.When people in the city voiced their reservations, she would respond head-on, claiming that her chosen course of action was out of a desire for "vengeance." This matter-of-fact confession would alarm them all the more and has convinced everyone that she joined the Knights of Favonius only to serve as a mole for the former aristocracy.One person who sees things differently is Acting Grand Master Jean. In fact, she speaks rather fondly of Eula."The rumors are all groundless. The Spindrift Knight is simply misunderstood, that's all."
On one hand, she is a descendant of the disgraced Lawrence Clan, the scion of a corrupt aristocracy. On the other, she is one of the top two sword fighters in Mondstadt.In other words, Eula is equal parts tainted blood and superior swordsmanship.There is no knowing when she might strike, nor what she might take from you... In the eyes of the citizens of Mondstadt, the Reconnaissance Captain is as unpredictable and tumultuous as the waves on a stormy sea.Eula responds with a cold haughtiness to accusations of this nature. To any who dare insinuate such things to her face, she replies, "How dare you. Hmph, I will remember this."She is consumed by the desire to avenge herself, but is often on the move far away from the city. Sometimes upon her return to Mondstadt, she will brandish her greatsword and march straight to the Knights of Favonius headquarters.On one occasion, two fresh recruits standing guard on their first day on patrol watched this scene play out before their eyes. Alarmed and unsure how to respond, they ultimately did not dare to intervene. Instead, they simply watched on helplessly while Eula made a beeline for Master Jean's office.Much to their surprise, however, hours passed and no sound of a struggle was heard from within.Still worried, the guards raised their concerns to Cavalry Captain Kaeya and Librarian Lisa as they were passing by."The Reconnaissance Captain is back again? When you saw her, was it when she was marching towards Jean's office with her sword in hand, looking like she wanted to kill somebody?""Goodness, I must head there straight away. How can they have a tea break without me?"Lisa hurried to Jean's office the moment she finished speaking. Meanwhile, Kaeya took the two guards outside and explained to them whilst trying to suppress a fit of the giggles:"We all know that the Acting Grand Master is a good judge of character, don't we? The Knights of Favonius are interested in a person's ability, not their family history. That's why she gives up her time to spar with the Reconnaissance Captain. In doing so, she can preserve the dignity of the Knights of Favonius while also providing a way of settling old grievances. Quite brilliant, don't you think?""Ohh... S-So that's how it is..." "...So 'tea break' is code for 'sparring'...?"This kind of thing occurs almost on a monthly basis. But... if they're engaged in some sort of strange sparring ritual in there for the sake of settling old grievances and honing their fighting skills... How come they don't make a ton of noise?
In truth, Eula is nothing like the fearsome predator many imagine her to be. On the contrary, constantly being met with prejudice at every turn means she is often the victim.At one time, shops would refuse to sell her their goods, restaurants would put no care and attention into her orders, and the citizens on her patrol route would refuse to cooperate with her. So, Eula's work is fraught with difficulties.When conflict arises, Eula fights back with a sternly worded threat to indicate that she will remember this grievance and make the offending party pay for it one day. It seems to work like a magic spell, because as soon as these words are uttered, the conflict ceases immediately without ever having to escalate to the level of an all-out confrontation.Funnily enough, although people always have their guard up around Eula, she is a law-abiding citizen and has never harmed another Mondstadter in her life. She may come across as having a somewhat frosty demeanor, but she is entirely scrupulous in her speech and conduct.No one can ever find fault with her actions, and as people gradually get to know her, their morbid fear of her will dissipate. They will also start to realize her threats of vengeance are nothing more than a figure of speech that simply serve as a verbal warning in the moment.Eula, who may or may not be working to bring down the Knights of Favonius from the inside... Eula, who may or may not be an aristocrat mole... New recruits in the Knights of Favonius find her the most difficult person to deal with.When Jean sends a new recruit to track down Eula in the wilds and deliver a new set of verbal orders, they always receive the same response: "If you have to resort to tasking the descendant of your former oppressors with doing your work, then perhaps you are not as strong as I thought."But despite the antagonism in her words, she will complete her newly assigned tasks to perfection. The new recruit is invariably forced to admit that with her abilities, it is no wonder she was able to achieve a captaincy within just a few years of joining the Knights.Everyone knows Eula is the frosty and antagonistic Spindrift Knight, the aristocrat who has a score to settle with the Knights of Favonius, the openly hostile and potentially dangerous individual... but is this really the truth of who she is?On the way back, the new recruit thinks back over Eula's every action."What was that kind and resilient look I saw in her eyes when she wasn't looking at me? She seems to take her job seriously... So, surely she can be relied on after all?"
Mondstadt is a city of freedom and happiness where even the descendants of a disgraced former ruling class can find true friends.Fortunately, there is one person whom Eula can rely on to be her spokesperson to the Mondstadt masses, and that person is Outrider Amber.Everybody loves Amber, so when she is around, shopkeepers will sell their wares to Eula at the normal price. If they're in an especially good mood, they may even exchange a few words with her during the process. It is at moments like this that Eula shows her most agreeable side.Because of this, and because Amber is just so nice, she'll often accompany Eula on trips out, or even run all her errands for her and deliver the goods straight to her home.Amber is also the reason that the city folk end up hearing all about the Reconnaissance Captain's accomplishments out in the field. Each time Amber informs them of Eula's long list of achievements in battle, they can't help but let out a little gasp of surprise.Early one weekend morning, Amber stood atop a makeshift stage of wooden crates and began announcing Eula's latest highlights: "Recently, the Knights of Favonius Reconnaissance Captain saved the life of Yanfei a woman at Dornman Port. After further investigation with this woman's close cooperation, she then proceeded to successfully capture all the Abyss Order operatives hiding in the vicinity of the port. The woman in question was a renowned legal expert from Liyue, and the Knights of Favonius have since received official correspondence from the Liyue Communications Office thanking the Reconnaissance Captain for her deeds..."Whether because Amber's persistent efforts have overcome historical prejudices or because Eula's achievements as a knight have quelled the long-standing fear in people's hearts, Eula's life has changed noticeably in recent years. Most of the city folk are no longer openly hostile towards her, and she has won over the members of the Knights of Favonius with her consistent results in the field.As for the members of the Reconnaissance Company under her leadership, they support her unconditionally. They always have her back when they head out to Mondstadt's outskirts to defend the peace of their nation.Of course, the person who has always tirelessly rooted for Eula, and who is now the most delighted to see people's attitudes towards her change, is Amber. They had been friends for a long time before Eula ever joined the Knights of Favonius, and as the beloved mentee of Amber's Grandfather Amber's grandfather, the first Outrider, Eula has her complete trust.
One might not expect this from her frosty attitude and sharp tongue, but Eula is a talented chef.The Reconnaissance Company today prides itself on having the best field rations in the Knights of Favonius. One staple of their inventory is a moon-shaped pie. Though a field ration, this wonderfully delicious and highly portable food is loved by all who try it.The Reconnaissance Company's designated chef once admitted that when developing this item, she was inspired by the captain's own baked goods. She extended the baking time to make the crust tougher and also substituted a few highly perishable ingredients with ones that last longer, reducing the cost while significantly prolonging the shelf life.Even after such a major change to the recipe, the pie still tasted delicious. So, whenever the scouts are snacking, they can't help but wonder: If this is the field ration version, how delicious must the captain's original recipe taste?The answer to this question is buried deep within the pages of a dusty old book in the library. The Lawrence Clan may have been overthrown a long time ago, but they have never given up hope of one day rising again and reclaiming their place as the ruling class. So that they are always prepared for this monumental moment, their offspring are subjected to an educational regime so unbelievably harsh that it is considered borderline abusive."Noble obligations" must be performed to absolute perfection in every possible sense, and these obligations cover etiquette, ritual, and study as well as cooking and other domestic chores.In the eyes of the Lawrence Clan, "Post-liberation Mondstadt lacks etiquette and taste. When the day comes for our clan to seize power once more, there shall be none who are qualified to be our servants. We must be cautious. We must never stoop to the level of the commoners and set foot in the quagmire of vulgarity."The Lawrence Clan's culinary arts teacher was particularly strict. If your dough was missing a half-spoonful of flour, or if your condiment was a few grains of salt short, or if you were two seconds late removing something from the oven, you were likely to be both scolded and disciplined. As far as Eula is concerned, the haute cuisine revered by the aristocrats is just another worthless consequence of people dogmatically following outdated rules.For this reason, the only kind of person who Eula will permit to try her own home baking is someone who she... respects...? No, that would be taking it too far. Rather, it should be someone who she grudgingly accepts "will keep following me around and bothering me, seemingly undeterred by my warnings, despite having crossed me many times to date."
Besides traditional etiquette, art is the second most highly prized asset to the aristocrats, known as the "second soul."The "Dance of Sacrifice" - a ritual used by illustrious families to display their nobility - is thought of as the crystallized form of this soul, the prize gem in the ruler's scepter.Folklore holds that Mondstadt's most illustrious clans jointly created the Dance of Sacrifice long before the aristocracy's reign of bloodshed began.The third act, which represents the Lawrence Clan, is a solo dance known as "Flickering Candlelight." The most important part of the Dance of Sacrifice, it was performed by the most senior dancer, who was typically the eldest daughter of the clan.The Lawrence Clan would summon top dancers to serve as tutors for the eldest daughter and ensure it was performed to perfection. Bleeding toes were seen as a point of pride and a rite of passage for every dancer.This ancient ceremony was a continuous tradition for so long that even today, long after being expelled by the people of Mondstadt, the Lawrence Clan still honors it.However, without the grand banquet and the gorgeous stage that once featured prominently in ceremonial performances, the Dance of Sacrifice is now far from the grandiose affair it once was. Furthermore, the stringent requirements regarding the dancer's posture and movements have also been relaxed due to the lack of tutors. In the end, the Lawrence Clan reluctantly decided that it could no longer be a mandatory part of the curriculum, and they relegated it to an artistic pastime.Over time, the negative connotations and elitist expectations associated with this dance have faded away, and today it survives simply as a graceful dance.As the eldest daughter of the present-day Lawrence Clan, Eula found it to be a relaxing pastime in her youth and a welcome respite from her other grueling courses of study.Today, Eula appears to have put her artistic pursuits behind her. At least, no one pictures dancing when they think of the Spindrift Knight.Nevertheless, a distinctly dance-like aesthetic can be observed in Eula's bladework, along with an elegant rhythm and musicality that are difficult to capture in words.As her greatsword rises and falls and sways to and fro, her distinctive and graceful poise is like that of a dancer under the moonlight: faraway, immaculate, and sublime.
Eula is the bearer of the Lawrence family crest, the "Glacial Seal." It is the highest martial symbol of the clan and represents the spirit of the Lawrence Clan in the early days of Mondstadt before their fall from grace: cold and unsullied, undaunted by any flame, composed and unshaken in all circumstances.Few among their number have passed the clan's trials in a thousand years, and the hopes of the clan are passed from one seal-bearer to the next.Eula was still quite young when she underwent the trial but she passed with ease, taking up the seal in the process. Then she departed with that badge of honor in her possession and has barely contacted the clan since.Her icy sword is a manifestation of the strength represented by the seal, striking with the cold, brutal force of a relentless blizzard and driving her foes into retreat.Yet, sharp and bright as ice as she is, she has the title of "Spindrift Knight," a name that leads many who hear it to assume that she manipulates Hydro instead of Cryo.There is a story behind that misunderstanding - the story of a habit.Eula carries an exquisitely crafted bone whistle with her at all times. Each time she blows it, the vivid sound of ocean waves rings out loud and clear, far and wide.Since the area her company is in charge of borders the sea, reproducing the sound of waves can be an excellent means of disturbing the enemy's judgment, or of deceiving less intelligent monsters into believing that a tsunami is inbound, causing them to flee in panic.Using this unique combat tactic has helped Eula emerge victorious against larger forces than her own on numerous occasions, and has also earned her the moniker of "Spindrift Knight."Of course, a bone whistle is capable of imitating many other sounds, and Eula has her reasons for imitating the ocean waves.It would seem that something akin to the "Glacier Knight" should suit her better.But perhaps Eula herself prefers the rolling waves to the cold and unyielding ice...Roaming freely across the world, gentle but firm with the reefs and sands in their dominion...Yes, she yearns not to be sharp and rigid like ice, but to be free and unbound like the ocean spray.
Where do "grievances" come from?Dire straits in the present? Or the misfortunes of the past?And what does "vengeance" mean?To right wrongs and rebalance the scales of justice in one's favor? Or to drive one's foes into a pit of agony?"Restore the clan's former glory, win the respect of the common folk, stand once more at the apex of rulership"... These things were utterly unimportant to Eula.She never experienced the great humiliation of her clan - and all the torment she had endured in life had been at their own hands. She attempted to free herself from their shackles, yet struggled to obtain recognition from the outside world.Her talk of grievances and vengeance was but a habit, a signal, a shield.For someone in her unique circumstances and position, what remarks should she just laugh off, and what ideas should she hold onto?How should she fight this battle to break free, once and for all, from the great burden of her bloodline?It was with all these questions and more circling around in her mind that Eula came under the tutelage of a long-forgotten old outrider. From him, she learned an open-mindedness and down-to-earth persistence that she had never previously encountered.Before grappling with grievances and vengeance, before questions of clan and outsider, she first had to discover herself.Her survival mechanism... her means of self-preservation... her grit and determination...She may articulate it in terms of "grievances" and "vengeance," but nothing can change what it is at its core: something both strong and kind.Eula finally found herself on a gentle path of revenge that was hers alone... and the moment she set foot on that path, there it appeared before her - her Vision.

<title>Parsifal</title>
<text>the Mondstadt noble the Fontainian magician Parsifal the Great
Parsifal,Ancient Investigation Journal: Part III'Now I think about it, Master Parsifal's disobedience, love of chivalric play-acting, and eventual departure must surely have been encouraged by him behind the scenes...' also referred to as the Phantom Thief and later as the Skipper's Chief Mate,Heart of Depth was a Mondstadt aristocrat who lived during the time of the Mondstadt Aristocracy one thousand years ago. He was a legitimate heir to Landrich and brother to the illegitimate heir Eberhart and legitimate heir Ingbert.
His chivalric nature and desire for justice, egged on by Eberhart, led him to become a vigilante who targeted his fellow aristocrats. Eberhart would eventually turn on him, forcing him to flee to Liyue in disgrace. He joined the Skipper's crew and eventually met his end in battle against the sea monster that the Skipper sought to take revenge on.
Parsifal was the wielder of The Alley Flash, Alley Hunter, and Iron Sting, and fictionalized accounts of his and his lover's, the Blue-Eyed Spear Witch's, story can be found in Wine and Song and Heart's Desire: Sapphire. His ultimate fate after his exile from Mondstadt is detailed in Heart of Depth.
Story
When he was younger, Parsifal was known for his disobedience and love of chivalric play-acting which he developed from reading the tales and songs of his ancestors.The Alley Flash Eberhart incited him to achieve his dream of becoming a phantom thiefFavonius Lance and Parsifal stole a sword from his own family's vault and left his noble house to hide among the streets.
Vigilantism and Downfall
After that point he roamed the city like a commoner and used his swordsmanship to rob the rich nobles and give the goods to the poor commoners. At the time people feared to light fires during nighttime, so he was able to hide easily. Sometime along the way he acquired a bow and used it in his robberies, which he was quite successful at, causing much fear and rage among the nobles.Alley Hunter At least some of his stolen goods he gave or sold to a mysterious shopkeeper that collected rare items.Heart's Desire The commoners loved him, but he would rather drink with friends than care for romance. That is, until a certain night when he was leaving a mansion with stolen goods and noticed a woman in a window whose eyes were as blue as the gem in the silver cup he had just stolen. Struck by her beauty, he climbed up to her, pried the blue gem out of the silver cup and gave it to her as a gift. This woman was the Blue-Eyed Spear Witch.Wine and Song
Unfortunately, this blue gem had the crest of the ruling family on it, and when the woman's master found out she had it, she was punished, which caused her to become angry at Parsifal despite still being in love with him. The next time they met, she warned that someday she would pay him back for the scars inflicted on her due to his actions, and they seemingly never met again. It's unknown whether the nobles had any idea what the true identity of the phantom thief was, but he continued stealing from nobles in Mondstadt for a long time.
Eberhart eventually deceived Parsifal in some way, forcing him to flee Mondstadt so that Eberhart could usurp his legitimacy. Parsifal buried the sword he had used as a phantom thief and then fled across the sea.
Aftermath and Death
Words that cannot be sung... Have I also forsaken the truth for illusions?Having lost it all, and given it all up, and then sinking beneath the waves......Maybe this isn't the worst of endings, after all. Hahahahaha!
Despondent over his brother's deception and his failure to reconcile with his lover, Parsifal fled to Liyue with only the slim sword known as Iron Sting and a blue feather. Depressed, he eventually became an alcoholic who drowned himself in the demon drink to forget his past. At some point, he fell in with the Skipper and became his Chief Mate despite his alcoholic tendencies. When the Skipper went to get revenge against a sea monster for his old crew, Parsifal followed. They managed to slay the sea monster at the cost of their own lives.
Parsifal would never discover that Eberhart used the Blue-Eyed Spear Witch's love for him to eventually slay her.Crescent Pike The people of Mondstadt, who never learned the true ending to Parsifal and the Blue-Eyed Spear Witch's tragic relationship, wrote songs that gave them a happy ending as a motivational tale.
Some five hundred years after their deaths, Parsifal and the Blue-Eyed Spear Witch were used as the basis for a play written by the Fontaine Fontainian playwright Coppelius. This play inspired the stage names for the magician Parsifal the Great and her sister-and-assistant, Josephine.The First Great Magic</text>

<title>Lawrence Clan</title>
<text>On the road bound to our exile, I watched my father sigh with grief; at the betrayal of the people, at the end of a glorious era, at the final chapter of history. [...] Only years later did I realize: it was we, the Lawrence clan, who had betrayed, who had ended a glorious era, and who had closed the history books. Only now was Mondstadt as it always should have been.
The Lawrence Clan, also called House Lawrence,Manga, Prologue:  was one of the prominent clans in Mondstadt after Barbatos took over, alongside the Gunnhildr Clan and the Imunlaukr Clan.Weapon Series: Sacrificial Series Another clan, the Ragnvindr Family, later joined them as one of the most prominent families in Mondstadt's history.YouTube:
The Lawrence Clan was the foremost clan during the Mondstadt Aristocracy era and, by the time the aristocracy grew corrupt, were effectively the rulers of the City of Mondstadt until they were deposed by Vennessa's rebellion. Now, the clan holds a poor reputation amongst Mondstadt's citizens, with many growing aggressive on the mere mention of them.
The Glacial Seal is the symbol of the Lawrence Clan.YouTube:  This symbol can be seen among a few of the weapons and artifacts of the Royal Series and Noblesse Oblige, as well as in Eula: Ice-Sealed Eula's namecard.
History
During Decarabian's Rule
The Lawrence clan apparently lived outside of Decarabian's Stormterror's Lair city and survived in the frozen wilderness as pioneers. Their survival under such harsh conditions made them view themselves as "conquerors."Sacrificial Bow
Early Aristocratic Period
Mondstadt Aristocracy
Venerare was the leader of the Lawrence clan when new Mondstadt was founded and she guided the people to build a statue in the plaza commemorating Barbatos' descent, upon which an oath was inscribed by the leader of all the clans.Royal Grimoire Lore
During the time that the people of Mondstadt worshipped the gods of Anemo and God of Time Time together, the Lawrence clan would reenact their victory over the frozen wilderness.
The nobles would hunt as a way of showing their strength in the natural world, sharing the spoils with the people out of benevolence. This tradition is likely based on the Lawrence clan's history and culture. They were tutored by the royal mages, who kept track of history and were responsible for instilling virtue in the nobles.
Late Aristocratic Period
Gradually, the Lawrence Clan's view of themselves shifted from conquerors to overlords to kings, causing them to go down the path to depravity and beginning the Late Aristocratic Period.
They tore down the statue of Barbatos that they put up in the City of Mondstadt Anemo God Statue Plaza plaza long ago to get rid of the oath written there, and the royal mages abandoned their duties to the nobles, no longer speaking of history or of the oath. They believed that nobles should only use swords, abandoning their heritage of using bows and not using spears either, considering both weapons for commoners and gladiators.Royal Spear
The Lawrence Clan also changed how the gladiatorial games functioned, changing them from religious ceremonies to bloodsport for their enjoyment.Royal Greatsword
When the land cried out for Barbatos, he saw the damage dealt by those he had left in charge and returned to Mondstadt once more to bring back freedom. Assisting a slave named Vennessa, the pair managed to bring the people into open revolt. However, Barbatos went a step further by drafting a false document in which the Lawrence Clan would sell Mondstadt to Morax. The soldiers that served the clan, fearing that they would be treated like slaves themselves, began supporting Vennessa's rebellion, leaving the clan with very few soldiers who were loyal to their cause.
The Lawrence Clan were eventually overthrown by Vennessa's rebellion, and they were forced by the people of Mondstadt to leave the city and never return. Eventually some members of the clan realized that they had betrayed the people, not the other way around.
Current Period
The clan relocated to another area in Mondstadt, but this current location remains unknown. They would often get into conflict with the locals, which result in the Knights of Favonius arriving to mediate, but to very little effect.
Descendants of the Lawrence Clan in the present day often face stigmas and are deemed a social threat; prior to joining the Knights of Favonius, Eula was forced to hunt and cook for herself as almost every shop refused her money.
Near the current time, Eula applied to the Knights, causing an uproar in both the common folk and the Lawrence Clan. Members of the clan confronted Eula over her decision to join outside the Knights' headquarters. Grand Master Varka and Acting Grand Master Jean allowed her to join, as she was talented in combat and both saw it as a waste to refuse someone skilled like her. The clan proceeded to denounce Eula as a traitor.
Sometime after Eula joined, her uncle, Schubert, conspired with the Fatui to reclaim Mondstadt and bring it back under "proper" rule. This plot was foiled by the Traveler and Eula herself, with Schubert taken into custody.
Another member of the clan, Lessig, decided to head to Sumeru after hearing of a way to restore the clan's honor. However, when he traveled through both Liyue and Sumeru, he was shocked to hear that no one cared or knew about him or their clan, realizing that he was taught to stick with the old ways and unable to see the truth until now, something which Eula had done long ago.
Clan Traditions
The Lawrence clan was known to have put a large emphasis on appearing noble, many of their practices coming from the idea that their perception in the eyes of "commoners" must befit nobility. Their extreme regimen is considered abusive in most regards, and they only hire the best of the best to tutor the younger generation.
The curriculum focuses mainly on combat, dance, cooking and etiquette. They also place high emphasis on art, calling it "the second soul".
In battle, Eula states that members of the clan always had to appear refined and steadfast no matter the circumstances. They also had to quickly think on the spot in the heat of battle. Being knocked over or frozen is considered unsightly and embarrassing.Speech and Etiquette
Dancing and art are extremely important part of the clan's traditions. Eula's Character Stories mention "The Dance of Sacrifice", a noble ritual, is believed to be the crystallized form of this second soul. The third act of this dance belongs to the Lawrence Clan, known as "Flickering Candlelight". It is a solo dance that has been passed down through generations, performed by the eldest daughter. Bleeding toes are seen as a point of honor when learning the difficult steps. While the segment used to hold great meaning, the clan was forced to drop it from the curriculum due to a lack of dancers to teach it, and has since been relegated as an artistic pastime; simply put, a graceful dance.
Due to the clan's insistence on retaking Mondstadt and returning to their former glory, they knew that they could not trust the commoners to make food for them. Emphasis was thus placed on cooking for themselves to avoid steeping to their levels of vulgarity, with particularly harsh rules - even the slightest of missteps would result in a harsh scolding or disciplinary action from the tutor. However, adherence to such rules ensured that the dishes made were of extremely high quality, such as Eula's signature dish, Stormcrest Pie. Even when Moon Pie modified, it was still noted to be extremely tasty and is now a local favorite. Food: Moon Pie Apart from fine cooking, members of the clan are particularly fond of Gebratenes Fleisch mit Sauerkraut, an extremely sour dish.
Great emphasis was also placed on how members should speak to other nobles of similar, lower or higher standing and commoners. Eula explains that the term "dear friend" should only used to address those the speaker were acquainted with and not particularly close. Trying to apply it to one particularly close would imply that the speaker was trying to estrange the recipient. Likewise, saying "good friend" is considered offensive. Commoners had to treat them with utmost respect; for those who had offended a noble, the commoner had to kneel and quickly apologize while not staring at them too long, lest the noble end up comparing the differences in status. In the clan itself, passing this knowledge to outsiders is strictly forbidden.Through the Motions, to the Heart
The Lawrence Clan's seal is known as the "Glacial Seal", and it is currently carried by Eula. It represents the Clan's disposition, all the way from the early days of Mondstadt, newly freed from Decarabian's tyrannical rule: cold and unsullied, undaunted by any flame, composed and unshaken in all circumstances.

<title>Snezhnaya/Culture</title>
<text>Snezhnayan culture is often very cutthroat, relating to the harsh environment of the frozen nation. The Tsaritsa extends her sphere of influence to the other seven nations of Teyvat through the Fatui.
Life in Snezhnaya
Due to Snezhnaya's harsh climate, people spend most of their time indoors and consider being alive to be a blessing in itself. There also seems to be a large emphasis on familial relations, as the Snezhnayans who have mentioned their family have been shown to be very close to them.Across the Sea
Camaraderie, cooperation and straightforwardness generally appear to be valued in Snezhnaya. The Adventurers' Guild, a mutual help organization for adventurers, was established in Snezhnaya,Lan while the Archive descriptions for Fatui Skirmishers remark that despite leaving their families to enter a dangerous profession, they have "gained allies to stick through thick and thin with". Tartaglia states that while Fire-Water is loved by most, those who drink it and chat together out in the cold gain the other's complete trust.Tartaglia Drinking an entire glass of Fire-Water in one go is the norm and considered to be very respectful.Vile
Snezhnayans also display remarkable devotion to their Archon, the Tsaritsa. Those who have been dispatched overseas and grown fond of their new country state that no matter the circumstances, they would never betray her.Andrei
You make a pinkie promise, you keep it all your life. You break a pinkie promise, I throw you on the ice. The cold will kill the pinkie that once betrayed your friend, the frost will freeze your tongue off so you never lie again.
On the other hand, the strong sense of kinship and emphasis on loyalty makes them view any kind of disloyalty, betrayal, or "debt" as a deeply personal affront. This appears to be the most well-known aspect of Snezhnayan culture, as Paimon remarks that the above nursery rhyme "kinda says all you need to know about Snezhnayan culture," The Fatui have an entire "debt collection" division that hunts down those who owe any "debt" to the Fatui, whether monetarily or from somehow offending the organization.Fatui Pyro Agent
Cuisine
Seaside regions of Snezhnaya primarily eat seafood. It is unknown whether this is true for all of Snezhnaya, or if this is largely limited to coastal towns. Snezhnaya is also known for its Fire-Water, an extremely powerful alcoholic blend.
According to Tartaglia, one authentic Snezhnayan dish is borscht, a name which in real life historically referred to various sour Slavic soups, but now usually refers to a red variety made with beetroots.Tartaglia
Another real-life Slavic food mentioned in-game (by the Fatui) are pierogi, implying they may be a part of Snezhnayan cuisine.Make Bright the Arrows, Gather the Shields...
Technology
Snezhnayan technology is undoubtedly superior to that of the other six nations. The Fatui military is notably the only known human faction in which all of its members are capable of elemental attacks, further highlighting their strength. The Fatui Skirmishers cover both ranged and melee departments, with their ranged fighters using guns or staves, while the Fatui Skirmisher - Electrohammer Vanguard wields a massive hammer and the Fatui Skirmisher - Anemoboxer Vanguard wields a pair of boxing gloves. The Skirmishers are also capable of imbuing their equipment, enhancing both offensive and defensive power at the same time. While there is a potential danger of the equipment shorting out and paralyzing the user, Anemoboxers are able to recuperate and restore them.
The knives used by Fatui Pyro Agent Fatui Agents are made with superior technology and meant to take advantage of human weaknesses.
Harbinger Il Dottore's former Ruin Guard research facility requires no human personnel to operate, saving on manpower costs. Alice also remarks that when she visited Snezhnaya, there were massive factories pumping out a wide assortment of items, which have yet to be seen in any other nation so far.
Designs, Motifs, and Symbols
Symbols in Teyvat
The following designs, motifs, and symbols are typically seen on Snezhnaya-related parties.
Character Cards
Because the only playable Snezhnayan so far is Tartaglia, who is one of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers, it is unknown whether non-Fatui Snezhnayans will have a different Character Card. (For example, there are two different Liyue Culture Character Cards Liyue Character Cards depending on whether the character is affiliated with the adepti or not.)
Fatui Character Card depicts eleven emblems, each representing a Harbinger, arranged in the negative space between the larger and smaller circles. It is assumed that the emblems are also their Constellations, as Tartaglia's (the bottommost one) and Scaramouche's - now Wanderer's (the one at 4 o' clock direction) - are the same symbol used for their in-game Constellations, Monoceros Caeli and Peregrinus, respectively.
Fatui Emblem
The Fatui emblem '(unofficial name)' is the logo of the Fatui that is typically seen on their masks and/or clothing and designate the person's affiliation with them. It depicts a stylized, filled-in Solomon's knot on top of another circular emblem.
Economy
Snezhnaya is the second-wealthiest nation in Teyvat after Liyue. This is primarily the result of Harbinger Pantalone, who determines Snezhnaya's economic policies and is particularly driven to make Snezhnaya the wealthiest nation in all Teyvat.Pale Flame

Festivals and Holidays

Krsnik Noc
Little is currently known about Krsnik Noc beyond the fact that it is celebrated in Snezhnaya.Ivanovich Ivanovich likens the festival mood during Lantern Rite Festival Lantern Rite to Krsnik Noc celebrations.
Politics
Currently, it appears that Snezhnaya is directly governed by the Tsaritsa and the Fatui. Some of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers also play vital roles in Snezhnayan politics, and sometimes become personally involved in matters regarding foreign relations.Goth
Most of Snezhnaya's foreign relations are handled by the Fatui, though their aggressive negotiation style and constant political and economic encroachment have given them a negative reputation. However, this does not seem to have greatly affected merchants who are not directly linked to the Fatui like Ivanovich and Maksim, who have not faced any explicit prejudice from natives. The Adventurers' Guild, despite hailing from Snezhnaya, also does not appear to have any negative reputation linked to it; however, it is also possible that its nation of origin is not common knowledge.
Domestically, little is known about the Fatui's reputation within Snezhnaya. However, it is hinted that ordinary citizens have little dealings with the Fatui on a day-to-day basis and see them largely as a military organization. Tartaglia claims he doesn't want his family "to have anything to do with the Fatui's... or should I say, Snezhnaya's... darker side."</text>

<title>Mondstadt/Culture</title>
<text>The nation of Mondstadt is marked by its adherence to "freedom," Barbatos' ideal.
Life in Mondstadt
Overall, Mondstadt has a casual, laid-back atmosphere derived from their belief in freedom over all else. There has been little socioeconomic stratification ever since the dissolution of the aristocracy 1000 years ago, although certain families such as the Gunnhildr Clan and the Ragnvindr Family enjoy a good reputation due to their long lineages and notable contributions to Mondstadt.
Alcohol plays a major role in Mondstadt both socially and economically. As a result, Mondstadt has a large drinking culture, which in turn has led to a relatively high amount of alcoholics. Nimrod talks about the "Four Drunkards," who are allegedly the biggest drinkers in Mondstadt,Nimrod though he himself is a relapsing alcoholic; this has earned him the consternation of his wife Eury and his confessor Sister Victoria, and Charles has to contact Eury whenever his drinking gets out-of-hand.Presumption of Innocence Diona's hatred of alcohol stems from her father Draff's personality change whenever he is drunk, though she fails to recognize that it is a direct response to his drinking habits.Draff
After Grace received several complaints from children about drunk fathers stumbling out of wardrobes, the Church of Favonius now sends deaconesses to pray over newly built wardrobes to ward off such incidents.Large Birch Wardrobe However, beyond hearing confessions and making prayers, the Church of Favonius seems to have little ability to address the real source of the problem, much to the frustration of confessors like Sister Victoria.
In Mondstadt's culture, the rose is symbolic with the keeping of secrets, and represents the saying "As wine bottles are corked, so too are my lips sealed." The idea that it could represent love, as it does in the Traveler's culture, is a completely foreign concept.,
Agriculture
Under Barbatos' blessing, most of Mondstadt has a gentle climate that allows crops to flourish. Fresh fruits such as sunsettias and apples are abundant, as well as grapes for making wine. Of the wineries in Mondstadt, the Dawn Winery is one of the oldest and most influential, with over a thousand years of history.
Common crops such as carrots and radishes can be found growing in small vegetable gardens in Springvale and the Dawn Winery. While they are not actively raised, Philanemo Mushrooms can be also found abundantly within the residential areas of Mondstadt and have been incorporated into Mondstadters' diets. Some fruits, such as Cocoa Paste (Of Drink A-Dreaming) cocoa fruit and Lemon (Of Drink A-Dreaming) lemon, are used in everyday cuisine but are not items typically encountered in-game.
While cows themselves have not been seen in-game, the icon and description for milk indicate that milk cows exist in Mondstadt, and dairy products are utilized in Mondstadt dishes.
Architecture
Much of the City of Mondstadt is constructed in Gothic architecture Gothic style and Timber_framing German_tradition_(Fachwerkhäuser) Fachwerk (timberframing).
Outside of the city, most towns and villages have smaller houses that are designed in a more traditional style, such as the Classic Country Home. While fireplaces are no longer needed in Mondstadt due to its constantly-moderate climate,Classic Country Home housing styles do not seem to have changed much. Thanks to the shorter height of the houses there, Springvale is often used as a practice ground for people learning how to use Wind Gliders.Amber
Education
It appears that most people are tutored for general education, and people may choose to enter a certain trade and become apprenticed to a master for further instruction, like how Schulz is apprenticed to Wagner and how Sucrose and Timaeus are assistants for Albedo to learn more about alchemy. The literacy rate in Mondstadt appears to be quite high, as no Mondstadt NPCs are illiterate like there are in the neighboring nation of Liyue.Both Lan and Ren'yu are explicitly stated to be illiterate or have low literacy skills, indicating that people from lower socioeconomic classes in Liyue might not receive any formal education. The only known Mondstadt character in present-day who is illiterate is Razor,Dodo-King of the Sea: Lying in Wait though this is due to him being raised by the wolves of Wolvendom.</text>

<title>Kirara/Lore</title>
<text>A courier who works for Komaniya Express, a delivery company in Inazuma. She has twin restless tails and is a nekomata who loves human society.
Personality
A courier for Komaniya Express, a delivery company in Inazuma. A nekomata who loves her job and human society.
Kirara is a youkai who enjoys working at Komaniya Express as she is curious about the world outside Teyvat and enjoys public interactions, seeing them as outings at her own expense. Due to her lack of knowledge about the outside world, she often mistakes others with non-human features or magic users to be other forms of youkai, such as mistaking Diona as a Mondstadt youkai due to her cat ears or Lyney to be one due to his magic skills. She enjoys her job and ensures that her customers have a pleasant experience, frequently worried about the prospect of getting fired and having to return to the wilds, which she considers boring.
As a nekomata, Kirara often has various feline instincts such as sleeping in boxes, pouncing on small animals and sunbathing on roofs, though she has to frequently suppress these instincts while in her human form to better interact with society.
Appearance
Whirling Bloom
Kirara uses the Medium Female Characters medium female model. She is a slim, fair-skinned young woman with pale, ash blonde hair that sticks out in tufts and green eyes. Part of her hair is tied into a high ponytail, and she has a long ahoge in the middle of it. She has a distinct set of two-toned cat tails. As with many other youkai, Kirara has an alternate feline form, though she does not use it as often as it attracts too much attention.
Official Introduction
Kirara: An excess of speed and an assurance of client satisfaction
She's an adorable little nekomata. Just whisper 'the parcel delivery is going to be late' in her ear while she's asleep, and she'll spring right up and start dashing faster than General Gorou does on the battlefield.
Komaniya Express, the famous delivery company in Inazuma, has a very special employee working under them. At a glance, she resembles an adorably dressed teenage girl with two tails swaying behind her. Though she treats each of her customers with kindness and generosity, secretly she sometimes takes to running quietly across rooftops to ensure none of her deliveries arrive late...
Though her obvious nature as a youkai drew more than few comments at first, as Kirara introduced herself with honesty and clarity time and time again while conducting her tasks with dutifulness and effectiveness, people not only dropped all lingering misgivings but even grew grateful for her presence. "Safe and punctual," "service assured," "vivacious and adorable"... These three phrases are words most commonly used to describe Kirara on the feedback board. Word is that if you give her a five-star rating or offer her some snacks, you might even see Kirara's face brighten with gratitude as her tails whirl with building joy.
To Kirara, her job is as precious as any jewel. She treasures everything about human society and is always overjoyed to behold the smiling faces of her customers. Thus, she gives her all to offer the best service she can for everyone she caters to. After all, if she finds herself fired by the company, all she can do is return being a youkai in the mountains.
Thankfully, her boss at Komaniya Express had never even considered the idea of releasing her. Contrarily, they privately asked Kirara if she wanted higher pay and to transition into comparatively less effortful secretarial work, but Kirara rejected their offer with haste. She didn't have the heart to tell her boss that, to her, every time she leaves to make a delivery, it feels like she's getting to enjoy an outing at the public's expense!
Character Stories
If you ask anyone in Inazuma which delivery company is the most reliable, the name "Komaniya Express" will surely be mentioned.If you were to continue the line of inquiry and ask just what about their service left the deepest impression, you would see a smile creep onto their lips as they tell you of a certain special courier...That adorable, vivacious young youkai with two twin twirling tails. After you thank her for delivering your package, she will bow deeply while wearing an expression of unadulterated bliss, as though she was the one receiving the gift.If you're willing to spend the time to leave a 5-star rating on the feedback board or give her a few snacks, you may even see stars of joy shoot from this youkai's eyes as her tails swish back and forth.Ah! But the same people who tell you this will also warn you that this nekomata isn't some weak little thing you can pick on. If you have designs on packages that don't belong to you or get carried away and try to touch her tails... Well, then you'll have to face the consequences.After hearing all this, it's hard to resist going to Komaniya Express..."Excuse me, I have a package to deliver, and I was hoping the neko-"Without waiting for you to finish, the owner turns around and shouts "Kirara! Another one for you!" as though it were an everyday occurrence.At that moment, a beaming girl will bound towards you, quickly fix her hair and adjust her clothes, and say with a smile-"Welcome, and thank you for choosing Komaniya Express!"
Kirara's earliest memories are of wandering the wilds of Inazuma.Back then, she was a nameless kitten with but one tail, and woke every morning with an empty, growling stomach. After a stretch, a yawn, and a single "meow" as though to bellyache about her circumstances, she would begin to hunt for breakfast. The menu often included finches that had let down their guard, or overly curious young fish too near the shore.Whenever she encountered adventurers out in the wilderness, she would lie down at a safe distance and watch intently as they fished out all kinds of marvelous instruments from their packs. Fwoosh! Suddenly there was a fire roaring. Bong! A strange cauldron was set over the fire. And then, with a bubbling sound, an intoxicating scent would occasionally waft over on the breeze...Observing this process with wide eyes, to her it was as if she had witnessed magic. Thus a yearning for human society began to flutter about in her chest, as though a butterfly had flown into her heart.During a frigid winter night with the biting winds howling, Kirara, still a small kitten, was frozen to the point of being unable to feel her tail."Gotta find a warm place to hide. Even a hollow in a tree will do..." She thought to herself. But when she was able to look up, she saw a cluster of warm lights flickering not too far away...This was the first time Kirara entered a human home, and while she was curious about everything around her, she was also frightened. The owner of the house seemed not to notice the kitten that had found its way into her home, but Kirara paid little notice. She found a small square box near the entryway into which she snugly fit, and into it did she sit, falling asleep almost immediately."I'll just rest the night, just one night..." were her last thoughts before dreams took her...Yet when she awoke, she found a warm fire crackled away next to her, and beside it was a fragrant bowl of nekomanma. Directly across from her was an old lady in the middle of knitting a woolen sweater. The old lady seemed to be trying to say something, as though encouraging her to eat. With her tail down and guard raised, she cautiously took a bite of that aromatic nekomanma in front of her that she was so curious about...It was the most delicious thing she had ever eaten, to the point she began to doubt whether or not she was still dreaming!And so, she stayed in that cozy little home for one winter after another, and heard story after story from that kind old woman...On occasion, when Kirara thinks back to that first night, she'll cock her head and ask herself:"Strange... what was I thinking about before I fell asleep again...?"
Kirara enjoys human cities, with their fireworks, marketplaces and scattered eaves. There is always something she's never seen before, waiting to be discovered.When she first became a nekomata, she used her youkai powers to enter Inazuma City in a human form. She eagerly explored every nook and cranny in the city, and not even the roof of the Almighty Shogun's Tenshukaku was immune from her curiosity. This is the reason that the Tenryou Commission is one of the addresses she is most familiar with.Though the Tenryou Commission taught her rules like "don't climb on other people's roofs" and "don't eat the ornamental koi", then she learned "how to be a good youkai in human society" from none other than the Yae Miko Lady Kitsune of the Grand Narukami Shrine. Kirara has caught the eye of "the greatest and coolest youkai," as she calls her, and Yae Miko, for her part, has been willing to impart all her experience upon her lively and interesting junior. Upon learning that Kirara felt the streets and alleys of Inazuma City were priceless treasures, Miko recommended that she seek employment at Komaniya Express."If you want to blend into human society, then you must work like an ordinary human. This is most important." Thus spoke the Lady Kitsune."Ah, yes," the illustrious priestess appended, "Packages addressed to Guuji Yae at the Grand Narukami Shrine must be given the utmost priority. This is even more paramount than what I just said before!"
Sometimes, bandits with less than honorable intentions will covet those bulging parcels. Hiding beside the paths that the deliveries must take, they carefully eye the passing couriers.If the delivery person looks tough, or is in a group, the bandits won't risk it. After all, it's just another day with an empty stomach at most.But when they chance upon a courier like Kirara, appearing delicate and traveling alone, their hearts leap with joy and anticipation. They can nearly taste the Mora that has fallen neatly into their laps.When Kirara passes, the bandits emerge from concealment and surround her, maliciously blocking her way forward."Huh? Do you need something?" Kirara stops uncertainly.Upon closer inspection, this young lady has two tails. Strange, to be sure, but she looks frail and her face is kind - the perfect prey, through and through. Even better, the pack she carries is bursting with thick packages. Truly, this is a good day for a robbery!"Uhm... If you have packages you'd like to deliver, please visit our Inazuma City offi-"Most bandits don't even let her finish before brandishing their blades. The more polite sort will attempt to persuade her to put down her delivery pack willingly for her own safety. The desperate will simply swarm her, hands outstretched to plunder.But whatever their methods, the result is always the same-The next morning, several large boxes will have appeared on the doorstep of the Tenryou Commission. Under the "Type of Goods Delivered" section of the delivery slip sealing the packages, a single word will be written: "Meanies."
When she first moved to Inazuma City, Kirara would often lie by the roadside, observing the pedestrians passing by."Oh! So this is how human girls dress..." Her wish to join human society made her very conscious of her own outfit, and whether or not it was similar to those around her.In the springtime, girls would often pluck a flower to place behind their ear or in their hair... Soon after, a special accessory became quite popular... Then everyone began flocking to some particular style of bracelet...Kirara accepted every style without question, imitating every trend as she saw it. She never thought there was anything wrong with what she was doing, just that all those accessories would occasionally restrict her movement and make it hard to climb up and down. It was so different from being a kitten out in the countryside!This persisted one day, when she was delivering a package to an old customer named Chiori, and she received a serious dressing down...At the time, Kirara had politely knocked on the door before gently pushing her way inside. But she couldn't have known that Chiori would glare at Kirara as though she were a cat that had fallen into a bucket of paints...This Inazuman fashion designer who had opened a famous design label in Fontaine was already quite familiar with Kirara, and so she spoke directly-"Utter insanity! What did you do on the way here? Fight Specters? What kind of garbage have you covered yourself in? How did that garish flower get stuck in your hair? It's assaulting my eyeballs. Really, the only thing on your entire body with a speck of taste is those shoes...""Um, Chiori, y-you know th-those are just m-my feet..." Kirara managed to stammer nervously.Chiori buried her face in her hands, and immediately picked up her scissors and some cloth before pulling Kirara into a changing room."Now don't you misunderstand! It's just that I'd be embarrassed to let anyone see you walking out of my shop looking like THAT!"The dressing down became a dressing up, and after the sound of snapping scissors and swift needlework faded to silence, Kirara had the outfit she now wears today.From then on, she had a new task when delivering packages: answering client's questions about just where she got that delightful outfit. Thus did the reputation of Chiori's shop spread far and wide."Hmph. I told you my judgment was immaculate." On this delivery run to Fontaine, Kirara found her friend in seemingly much better spirits."Other than the clothing orders, is there anything else?" Inquired Chiori."Yes, there is, it's just that...""Come on, out with it, stop beating around the bush!""The customers are asking... if you, that is, your shop... Can you release a shoe design that looks like a cat's paw pads?"
To Kirara, every delivery is a priceless treasure. Each package takes her to different places, and allows her to see all kinds of scenery.After work, Kirara would go to the "Undelivered Packages" section of the warehouse, and see all the myriad reasons that packages couldn't be delivered to their recipients."Filled in wrong address," "recipient moved," "wrong name"...Each stranded package was like a fish bone lodged in her throat, choking her slowly. Thus, she began to quietly record the details of each package, and used her routes during work and spare time to discover the whereabouts of each recipient.This resulted in the reputation of Komaniya Express increasing by the day, as customers rushed to praise the reliability and quality of their service: No package was undeliverable.When the owner of Komaniya Express heard of this, they spent all night designing a new title to issue to Kirara: Gold Level Courier."Actually, when I saw that the 'Undelivered Packages' section was empty, I thought we'd been robbed..." confided the owner.For Kirara, her greatest happiness is the moment she delivers a package into the hands of the recipient. After a long day making deliveries, she likes to climb to a high place, taking in the sights of the city while listening to the sounds of mirth drifting upward from the markets.This is when she recalls her days as a kitten, listening to stories on the lap of that old lady. The twists and turns and sudden reveals, the fantastic beasts and monsters, all gently follow Kirara's memories like the cool evening breeze, blowing gently into her heart.And just like the old days, she gently closes her eyes as the stories intermingle with her dreams, welcoming the arrival of tomorrow with contentment.
Some clients of Komaniya Express may be surprised to discover a mysterious package at their door. Most of these packages are small and exquisite, and beautifully decorated.Cupping the parcel in their hands and shaking their heads, they might think it strange, as they haven't bought anything recently, nor is there any writing on the package. But they may have already forgotten that in the not-too-distant past, they gave some snacks to that courier with two tails.Each package usually contains a lovely little gift, such as a dried flower of the Nilotpala Lotus, a Starconch ornament, or if the household has young children, a Scarab with peculiar patterns on its shell!These are all items that Kirara has collected while out on her deliveries. To her, each is a novel and fascinating treasure, and perfect as thank-you gifts. Unfortunately, the rules of Komaniya Express forbid any transactions between employees and clients. Thus, Kirara must make each small box herself, adding cute decorations, and quietly placing them on the recipients' doorsteps.However, the beneficiary of by far the most "mystery packages" is a small home in the Inazuman countryside...Though Kirara is quick to say she never wants to go back being some "great youkai" roaming the mountains and valleys, whenever she has time, she will always run back to that old house from that frigid winter's night. Leaving a present at the door, if she happens to find the old woman sunning herself in the yard, she'll immediately return to being a cat. "Meow, meow," she'll call, jumping up onto the woman's knees, curling up into a ball and pouting for attention."Ah! Back, are we, Kirara?" The old woman smiles and laughs. She doesn't know that this little cat is already a renowned courier. All she knows is that she often goes out to "play" for ever longer periods."You really are growing up so fast. I remember when I found you in the box, you were such a tiny little thing..." Scratching Kirara's head, the old woman fishes out a round, shimmering pearl and places it on her paw pads."See? This is that Sango Pearl from the story. Now, I don't know who it's from, but there it was on the doorstep, along with some snacks, too." The old woman also quietly observes to herself: "When I wake up, the house is so clean and orderly, and breakfast is already prepared. How very odd...""Why, you haven't grown into a youkai who takes care of me in my old age, have you, little cat?"Whenever Kirara hears this, she stretches innocently, letting out a contented yawn as she pretends to have no idea what the old woman is saying.After speaking, the old woman falls silent and just smiles warmly. The two of them then continue to enjoy a leisurely afternoon bathed in sunshine.
One night in the depths of midwinter, Kirara was lying down by the coals, taking a nap. But try as she might, she simply couldn't sleep well.The charcoal had long burned out, and even the smoldering embers had gasped their final breath as the chill wind rattled in through cracks in window frames and seeped under the doors. Kirara involuntarily curled up tightly, hugging her tail close. Lately, her tail was always itchy and restless, and no matter how much she licked it, it was never enough to calm it."Strange, Granny left this morning, she's been gone way too long..." she quietly mewed to herself.The final lingering ember became darkened ash, and even the residual warmth it had provided was snuffed out. Kirara stretched out and looked out uneasily at the snowflakes falling outside the house, and then quietly leaped out the window.The snowflakes under her feet were chilly, and her paw pads soon ached from the cold. Climbing onto the roof, she gazed out towards the city. But the moon was totally obscured this night, and the surroundings were pitch black without even a speck of light."I remember there was a really really tall tree nearby..."Kirara's tail seemed even more anxious than she was. As she climbed, it repeatedly refused to obey her mental commands and nearly caused her to fall.The tree stretched ever upward, so tall it seemed without end. Kirara did not think about just how high she had climbed. Instead, stories of youkai and humans raced across her mind. It seemed as if she wasn't climbing a tree but pursuing days gone by, and if she was but a step too slow, all might slip away forever..."Faster, just a bit faster..."Finally, she reached the crown of the tree, and all the world lay spread beneath her. In the distance, a dazzling light suddenly lit the blackness before her eyes like a firefly - the light from the city at night.In that moment, it was as if something dormant in Kirara's heart was ignited, and all the fantastical stories of the past had finally become reality, a thousand rays of shimmering light streaming into that galaxy of fireworks. The stories that had once seemed so far away were now so close she could almost reach out and touch them, and she now yearned as never before to bask in that glow."Ah! I see her!"Somehow, an unseen power helped Kirara pick out the one person she desired to see amongst the dazzling stream of lights.When she safely alighted back on the ground, the clouds parted and the moonlight cast her shadow upon the snow, a shadow that now boasted two tails..."Are you sure you don't want to stay the night? The snow has only just stopped, and getting back won't be easy," urged the landlord."No, no, I couldn't! I have a little cat at home, waiting for my return, haha..." laughed the old woman as she stood before the entryway."If that's the case, I'll take you back!" A young female voice suddenly rang out from outside.The landlord and old woman peered outside, and there they saw a youthful lady with two restless tails, and a shining Vision dangling from her waist.

<title>Defiled Statue</title>
<text>The Defiled Statue is a Statue of The Seven found along with an Abyss Herald in the ruins around Mt. Aocang, inside the Call of the Abyss domain.
Profile
The Defiled Statue was originally a Statue of The Seven devoted to Barbatos. However, it was eventually stolen in an unknown incident, after which Mondstadt's people began telling stories about The Lost Statue of The Seven.Dishonorable Trial The statue had been stolen by Chlothar, who used his experiences with the Abyss to corrupt the statue.
Unlike the other statues, it is hung upside down by chains and the elemental object in its hands has been corrupted and surging with abyssal energy. The Abyss Order tasked an Abyss Herald with protecting the statue from interlopers.
Sometime after Osial was defeated, a group of Treasure Hoarders banded together to distract the Abyss Order while sending a single thief, the Grand Thief, to infiltrate and steal any valuables. Due to untold circumstances, the Grand Thief met his demise.It is heavily implied that the Grand Thief did not die from external injuries, despite their proximity to the Abyss Herald. Therefore, it may only be presumed that they died to overexposure to Abyssal Energy surrounding the area, or alternatively some other force of nature (such as the Voice Inside the Head Sinner, which may explain why the Grand Thief was in a worshiping position, given that the Defiled Statue was tainted by Chlothar Chlothar Alberich) The statue and the Grand Thief's kneeling corpse would later be discovered by the Traveler and Paimon.Involuntary Sacrifice
Later, Dainsleif decodes a talisman from an Abyss Mage, concluding that the Order planned to use the Defiled Statue to create a mechanized god. They would replace the core the statue usually held with the eye of the first Field Tiller and then attach Osial's limbs to the arms of the statue. This way, they would create a machine to "topple the divine thrones of Celestia."A Herald Without Adherents
Dainsleif then plans to destroy the inverted statue to prevent the Abyss Order from creating their mechanized weapon. When they return to the ruins, the Traveler meets their sibling in front of the inverted statue.A Soul Set Apart

<title>Romeuf</title>
<text>Romeuf is an NPC mentioned in 'Genshin Impact'.
Profile
Romeuf is a former Spina di Rosula member. He left the organization following a fallout with Callas over the Aquabus system; Romeuf believed the funds used for its construction would be better off improving Poisson, while Callas believed that the system would pay off in the long term due to its cooperation with the Court of Fontaine and Fontaine Research Institute. When his wife, Clementine, also supported the idea, Romeuf and his followers believed that she had lost her credibility as an impartial mediator due to her pregnancy. They eventually parted on bad terms due to Callas' stubbornness.
Even after both Callas and Clementine's deaths, Romeuf and his followers saw Navia with disdain, believing her to be the same as her father. While desperately low on Mora, Romeuf concocts a plan to kill Navia by collapsing the Clementine Line, resulting in the rubble destroying Poisson in the process. Upon learning of Colter's release from the Fortress of Meropide, he tasks him with killing Navia; however, he could not get the chance with the Traveler around. Following a chance encounter with one of Romeuf's subordinates, Martinat, Colter tips off Romeuf and his subordinates of Florent's check, allowing them to escape and start their plan. He also sends several subordinates to infiltrate the town to sabotage any evacuation attempts.
The plan is foiled by the Traveler and Navia, who stop most of the intended damage on the line and the rubble from destroying Poisson. The Maison Gardiennage, alerted to the attack, soon arrive and arrest Romeuf and all of his subordinates, which Navia has no qualms with despite them being ex-Spina members due to their willingness to harm innocents rather than talk with her.

<title>Narzissenkreuz Institute</title>
<text>The Narzissenkreuz Institute was an organization in Fontaine which was established to raise orphans and the children of criminals. It is prominent for being involved in the lives of many major Fontainian figures during and after the cataclysm 500 years ago.
After the disappearance of the Director Lyris and the death of the Vice Director Basil Elton over the course of the cataclysm, the Narzissenkreuz Institute disbanded.
Overview
The exact date of the Narzissenkreuz Institute's founding is unknown. It was given the name "Narzissenkreuz" since the building was established over the ruins of an ancient civilization; it is also described as a "home [...] that would not see the light of either sun or moon,"Heroes' Tea Party although the exact meaning of this phrase is currently unclear. The Institute is led by the Director Lyris, who was a gentle-natured Oceanid as the position was established in honor of the first Hydro Archon, Egeria. The Vice Director Basil was chosen from those with "exceptional moral quality and ability."Ann's Story
In Narzissenkreuz Institute, play-acting was a common pastime, with the children acting out the roles of Narzissen champions, wicked mages, evil dragons, and heroes. Afternoon tea and tea parties were a regular part of life at the Institute, and the Vice Director's refreshments were particularly good.
There are indications that some members of the Institute might have closer links to the elements than regular humans. Rene notes that his and Jakob's bodies were similar in composition to that of the "sacred lotus," likely referring to the Gaokerena formed from the remains of Egeria, but it had no commonalities with the body composition of Mr. Karl, the third expedition member. Later, when assessing the lackluster results he obtained from Khaenri'ahn Azosite, Rene states that it was because "the object they chose was pure elemental force, which lacks any will whatsoever," and proceeds to liken it to "the difference between the Director and a Hydro Slime."Rene's Investigation Notes
History
Presumably since the founding date, the Institute was led by a gentle-natured Oceanid named Lyris as its Director.The Director's name is implied to be Lyris based on the mentioned name throughout the 'Ann of the Narzissenkreuz' Quest Chain, but currently it does not have direct confirmation. The second-to-last generation of the Institute included Emanuel Guillotin, Basil Elton, Karl Ingold, and Dwight Lasker.Forgotten Vessel At some point, Basil Elton was appointed as its Vice Director following her retirement. Carter Scherbius also joined the Institute, presumably sooner than Rene and others.Ancient Log Ancient Log  2 Rene de Petrichor, Jakob, Alain, and Mary-AnnNymph's DreamMary-Ann's Story were among the last generation in the Institute. Rene and Jakob's parents were most likely killed during the Siege of Poisson,Enigmatic Page (II) while Alain and Mary-Ann's origin was unknown.
The Cataclysm
To stand against the destruction of the cataclysm, both Lyris and Basil left the Institute sometime before Rene and Jakob went to the Girdle of the Sands as part of their own research on ways to put an end to the disaster. Alain remained at the Institute. Basil perished at sea while Lyris and the "sisters" she left with never returned.Odyssean Flower While Rene's remarks suggest she was rather powerful, he conveys his doubts about her survival.
Before departing, the Vice Director left the dark green feather in her hat in the hands of Jakob, and she entrusted Rene with the task of taking care of another member of the Institute.Wicked Mage's PlumuleConsidering that there are two blanked-out names in Wicked Mage's Plumule's description, and the feather is stated to have "reach[ed] the source of that which caused the calamity of parting," it is possible that the two names are meant to be Rene and Jakob's. The two traveled together to Khaenri'ahn ruins to study their power sources; other lore related to Khaenri'ah reveals that much of their technological advancement was derived from forbidden knowledge and the Abyss, which led to the cataclysm.
Following a great flood which presumably destroyed much of their home, Rene and Jakob went to the Girdle of the Sands to research new energy sources, using Khaenri'ahn research as their basis. The two were accompanied by Karl Ingold,Given that Karl was involved at Poisson shortly before the Siege of Poisson alongside Jakob and Rene's parents, it seems likely that the "Mr. Karl" in Rene's Investigation Notes was Karl Ingold. although Rene and Karl distrusted each other and Rene went through some great lengths to keep Karl from finding out a certain secret. The two also argued over the usage of a certain power which was blamed for the massive flood. Rene and Jakob eventually made a breakthrough, however, and departed from the ruins to report their findings to Alain.
Legacy
The members of the Institute "scattered" after it became evident that the Director and Vice Director would never return. Some were taken in by the Marechaussee Phantom or the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol and worked to protect Fontaine, while some were taken in by explorers and adventurers and moved abroad.
Based on Basil's request, some of the kids would be adopted by her friends Karl Ingold and Emmanuel Guillotin in case she would not return. Karl likely adopted Rene and Jakob and accompanied them to the Girdle of the Sands, while Emmanuel adopted Alain and Mary-Ann.Veteran's Visage
Alain enrolled in the Institute of Natural Philosophy, while Mary-Ann joined the Marechaussee Phantom. Rene and Jakob also joined the Institute of Natural Philosophy by Alain's recommendation.Enigmatic Page (IV) Follow an incident with Alain's assistant Carter Scherbius, the relationship between Alain and Rene fell off.Enigmatic Page (V) Rene established a secret Narzissenkreuz Ordo with most of the Institute of Natural Philosophy's members using Jakob's trick to mesmerise them, while Alain left and joined the Marechaussee Phantom with his sister.
Alain eventually went on to establish the Fontaine Research Institute, which is dedicated to studying machines and energy.Vibro-Crystal Reharmonization

<title>Inazuma/History</title>
<text>Timeline
A timeline of historical events in the Inazuma region.
section=1 Timeline TimelineNote
The Old World
Timeline The Old World
The New World
Timeline The New World
* 400 years after the Primordial One appeared ― The region of Enkanomiya was part of the single, unified human civilization which spanned the whole world.
* Second Throne of the Heavens ― The war between the Primordial One and the Second Who Came ravages the heavens and earth. Enkanomiya falls into the depths of the ocean and is severed from the surface world.
Divine Envoy Era
'Note: It is currently assumed that the Divine Envoy Era occurred after the Second Throne of the Heavens since Enkanomiya, which fell during that conflict, is said to have minimal influence from divine envoys.'
Enkanomiya
* The people of Enkanomiya clash with the Dragonheir of the Depths, vishaps who fled into the ocean depths after the Primordial One defeated the Seven Sovereigns of the old world. Because there was no light in the ocean depths, the vishaps had a great advantage.
** Istaroth, the undying wind and presumably one of the Primordial One's four shining shades, is the only one who does not forsake the people of Enkanomiya, as they are able to detect her undying wind from the depths of the ocean.
* The sage Aberaku (originally known as Abrax) builds the Dainichi Mikoshi (which he dubbed "Helios"), creating artificial light to drive away the vishaps. It is believed that Istaroth granted Abrax wisdom.
* 1 year after the Dainichi Mikoshi's construction ― People attempt to find the way back to the surface, but are unable to. They interpret this as a ban from the Primordial One, and that meant the Primordial One had defeated the Second Who Came.
* ? years ago ― A cabal of corrupt nobles manipulates the people of Enkanomiya into worshipping the Dainichi Mikoshi as a god, and chose a child to be the Sunchild and rule over the land. The Sunchildren were puppet rulers controlled by these nobles. Abrax, and later Spartacus (Supada no Hiko), opposed the corrupted nobles only to be imprisoned by the Sunchildren.
Other Islands of Inazuma
'Note: It is unclear when the following civilizations existed, so they have been tentatively placed under the Divine Envoy Era.'
* A civilization in Tsurumi Island was built and had connection with Celestia. A similar civilization was found beneath Seirai Island.
* ? years ago ― In the area that is now north of Mt. Yougou, Narukami Island, a kingdom built on sand had a foolish ruler who wanted to build a high garden in honor of the white sakura tree. The kingdom was swept away by floods.
* ? years ago ― A great flood ravaged the land, leaving only a few islands left. These islands are likely Narukami Island, Kannazuka, Yashiori Island, Seirai Island, and Tsurumi Island. (Watatsumi Island was created by Orobashi towards the end of the Archon War, and therefore does not exist yet.)
Pre-Archon War
* ? years ago ― The Tanuki, creatures native to Inazuma, evolve and gain sentience. The Kitsune immigrate from mainland Teyvat and attempt to colonize the islands, instigating a war between the Tanuki and Kitsune over control of Inazuma.'Toki Alley Tales' is a relatively unreliable source that has little information that can be cross-checked. As a result, while its account of Inazuma's history has been recorded, its veracity is highly questionable.
** 1600 years later ― The Tanuki-Kitsune War finally comes to an end after 1600 years of fighting after negotiating a truce. The Tanuki refuse to admit a loss in the war but cede the "giant Thunder Sakura" (likely the Sacred Sakura) to the Kitsune. Over the course of the war, the tanuki and kitsune's constant transformations and trickery lead members of both groups to become confused on their original identities and allegiances; this resulted in the emergence of humans.
Tsurumi Island
* ? years ago ― The civilization on Tsurumi Island comes to an end through unknown means.
* ? years ago ― An eagle known as the Kanna Kapatcir Thunderbird spots a fog-covered Tsurumi Island and decides to make its home there. At some point, objects fall from the heavens - possibly the Divine NailCelestia is depicted in one of the murals below the island, and the object fits the description of the nail. -, one of which lands on Tsurumi Island. This temporarily clears up the fog, only for the fog to return in even greater force later.
** Humans on the island begin gathering the Thunderbird's shed feathers and worship it, but the bird does not think much of them. The people learned to use Maushiro to locate each other amidst the fog, and they feared and worshipped the eagle. However, the Thunderbird paid them no heed, seeing them as no different from other animals.
The Archon War (?–2000 years ago)
* ~2000 years ago ― The twin gods Raiden Makoto (Baal) and Raiden Ei (Beelzebul) slay all other gods in the Inazuma region. Ei, although the stronger fighter, believed Makoto to be better-suited for the role of Archon and sacrifices her body so Makoto can ascend to Celestia. Makoto becomes the first Electro Archon, the God of EternityIn 'Radiant Sakura', Makoto confirms that her ideal is also eternity, that "Eternity extends time into infinity, dreams illuminate each moment within." Ei comments that Makoto's understanding of eternity is much more profound than her, leading to her "no longer pursuing an eternity defined by stasis." In 'Wishes (Quest) Wishes' in Chapter II: Act III - 'Omnipresence Over Mortals', Yae Miko points out that Makoto "in each moment cherished the beauty of what was before her."According to Yae Miko in Wishes (Quest) 'Wishes', Makoto and Ei "won the Archon War together," whereas Treasured Tales indicates that Ei technically "lost" the Archon War by sacrificing her body so Makoto could ascend. Based on current prevailing in-universe sentiment that the Archon War had a "last man standing" rule, and lore about Andrius choosing death so he would not become the Anemo Archon, the wiki assumes Treasured Tales' account is correct.
** Makoto uses her new powers to recall Ei's divine will and reforge her body. Ei becomes her 'kagemusha' (body double), and most people in Teyvat gain the impression that there was only one god, Baal (also referred to as the Narukami Ogosho, Raiden Shogun).While Baal is Makoto's Goetic name and Ei's is Beelzebul, Zhongli refers to Ei as "Baal" in 'The Fond Farewell' and Venti and Zhongli's Voice-Overs about Ei are both titled "About Baal." Given that they are aware of the distinction between Makoto and Ei, it is presumed that they continue to use Makoto's title for Ei out of respect for the twins' decision.
* ~2000 years agoIt is unclear when exactly Orobashi fled to the Dark Sea and later created Watatsumi Island, or when it was defeated. Orobashi peacefully lived under Baal's rule for a while, which means it was alive after Makoto ascended to Electro Archon, but it was stated to have died 'during' the Archon War. This indicates that both Makoto's rise to Electro Archon 'and' Orobashi's death occurred before the official end of the Archon War 2000 years ago. ― Orobashi flees from an unknown region to the nation of Enkanomiya Byakuyakoku, specifically The Serpent's Bowels. It stayed there for a while until a child from the underground nation found it and asked it to become their gods. Together they fought the Sunchild's reign and came out victorious, after which it became known as "Orobashi no Mikoto" and the "Watatsumi Omikami" (Great God of the Oceans).
** It is supposed that the ban placed by the Primordial One must have been weakened to allow Orobashi to fall to Byakuyakoku.
** Orobashi supposedly stayed with the people for a while before leading them back to the surface. It used its power to bolster the Dainichi Mikoshi to have stronger light, and eliminate the threat of the Dragonheir of the Depths. It also supervised the research of the Dragonheirs, now called Bathysmal Vishaps.
** The Divine Priestess was chosen among the sea-daughters who collected pearls, and was likely the origin of the Sangonomiya Clan. Other clans like the Yuna Clan also originated from Enkanomiya.
** Orobashi had its people adapted to Narukami Island Narukami's language and culture to be prepared for a new life above the sea.
** Orobashi creates Watatsumi Island out of the coral that grew from its body, allowing them to live above the surface once more as part of the Inazuma archipelago.
*** On the last day of Enkanomiya before the people relocated above the sea, envoys from Khaenri'ah along with a Ruin Guard came and stole the book Before Sun and Moon, a book that Orobashi personally placed a ban. Antei fought them and prevented the loss of the book, but was also critical injured.
** Orobashi's people call this land Sangonomiya, and themselves the Sangonomiya Clan. They begin calling Byakuyakoku, "Enkanomiya," to contrast it with Sangonomiya.
* ? years ago ― The Kitsune Saiguu is born in the Hakushin Lands.Ei, Chiyo, the Kitsune Saiguu, and Sasayuri are depicted together in  which indicates they were all alive before the war against Orobashi, during which Sasayuri lost his life.
** The Kitsune Saiguu and the bake-danuki Ioroi often compete with each other. One day, Saiguu decides to trick both Ioroi 'and' Baal at the same time: she challenges Ioroi to pluck a Naku Weed from the Tenshukaku gardens. When Baal catches him in the act and nearly kills him for it, Saiguu comes to his rescue and persuades Baal into not only sparing him, but also putting him under her command as the Hidden Protector of the Grove, the protector of Chinju Forest.
* ? years ago ― The Sacred Sakura grows from "her" body after "her" death; at this point, the tree does not have a fox-like appearance.
** Above is the knowledge of people (excluded Ei) who lived before and in the cataclysm. The true Sacred Sakura was not planted until the present.
** A ritual involving the worship of both the Raiden Shogun and Orobashi is developed. This ritual must be performed before starting any other ritual. The Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual is also developed at some point, presumably after the aforementioned ritual.
** The Thunder Sakura are planted across Narukami Island, using branches of the Sacred Sakura and parts of the Electro Archon's own spirit, to absorb filth from the land.
* ~2000 years ago ― After Watatsumi Island's infertile land leads to years of famine and disease, Orobashi reluctantly agrees to the Watatsumi people's plan to invade and conquer part of Yashiori Island. A brutal war erupts between Watatsumi and the Narukami Shogunate, led by Ei, which ends with Orobashi slain and Watatsumi's major figures either dead or Missing in Action.
** Major figures on the Narukami side, not including Ei:
*** The Great Tengu Sasayuri, Ei's lieutenant. He is slain during battle, likely against Akuou, who had sought a "joyful" duel against him.
** Major figures on the Watatsumi side, not including Orobashi:
*** The shrine maiden Mouun was particularly skilled in the Yuna Clan's whale-songs and employed the aid of a massive whale. She taught Akuou and was close to him. During the war, she and her whales were ambushed and killed by Sasayuri's subordinates, and their bodies were taken away by the Shogunate.
*** "Umigozen" Ayame, Mouun's twin sister. She was the general of the Watatsumi navy, and disappeared in the midst of battle with her fate left unconfirmed.
*** The "Viceroy of the East" Akuou, also known as Touzannou, was found as an orphan and taken in by Orobashi, and later trained under Mouun. He conquered one of the mountains on Yashiori Island, which the Watatsumi people called "Touzan" (Eastern Mountain), and built the Formation Estate on top of it. He was ultimately slain alongside Orobashi when Ei used her ultimate technique, Musou no Hitotachi.
** Some believe that Orobashi participated in this war, despite oracles of its inevitable failure, due to an order from Celestia.
*** It was revealed that since Orobashi had contacted with the people of Enkanomiya, both Orobashi and Watatsumi as a whole were found guilty of four counts of profanity and eight counts of deceiving living souls. Orobashi was allowed to take all of their transgressions on itself and sacrifice itself so its people would be spared and taken under the rule of Celestia once again.
* The Tatarigami supposedly spawned after the death of Orobashi in Yashiori Island. Ei created wards called Narukami Pillar to suppress the soul of Orobashi, hence subduing the Tatarigami, while the Yashiori Guardians led by the Kitain Clan also took up the mantle of suppressing the Tatarigami.
Tsurumi Island (The Archon War)
* Kanna Kapatcir tells Ruu that she heard "the melodies sung by the blue flying dragon of the far north." This dragon is currently believed to be Dvalin, who descended onto Mondstadt after Barbatos became Anemo Archon. Assuming that is correct, this means Ruu lived sometime after Barbatos ascended 2,600 years ago. ― Ruu is born among the people of Tsurumi Island and makes preparations to participate in the rituals to the Thunderbird. While practicing his singing, the Thunderbird overhears him and is captivated by the sound of his song. Ruu attempted to befriend the god and give her the name "Kanna Kapatcir," as the Thunderbird had forgotten her own name. They promised to meet each other again in the future.
* However, as the situation on the island worsened and many islanders left only to never return - which people took as a sign that they had died, when in actuality they had settled onto the other islands of Inazuma - Ruu volunteered to be sacrificed, believing this would please the Thunderbird and bring the missing people back. Instead, she becomes enraged upon witnessing his death, viewing his sacrifice as the killing of innocents and a promise broken, and retaliates by destroying the area and killing the entire tribe. To hear Ruu's singing again, she uses her powers to cause a ley line disorder, resulting in the entire island continuously reliving its day of destruction. Afterward, the Thunderbird flies over to Seirai Island.
** After Orobashi's deathBased on the sequence in 'Story Teaser: Promise of a People's Dream', Kanna Kapatcir was killed after Orobashi. ― Kanna Kapatcir was hunted down and killed as a "monster" at Seirai Island by Raiden Ei, who viewed the Thunderbird as an "obstacle to progress." The remnants of her power were sealed at Asase Shrine, where they formed a coagulation of regret known as the Thunder Manifestation. Wards are set up across the island, including one at Asase Shrine, to keep the Thunderbird's power at bay.
Post-Archon War (2000–500 years ago)
section=1 Timeline archonwarend
* ? years ago ― The unnamed author of New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune is born in the Hakushin Lands.In 'New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune: Prologue', the chief editor (Yae) tells the author "'I wasn't even born yet when she left,'" to which the author writes, "And I was still in my youth back then." Based on 'New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune (V)', "she" refers the Kitsune Saiguu and the place she left was the Hakushin Lands.</text>

<title>Nikolay</title>
<text>Nikolay Snezhevich ru=Николай Снежевич ru_rm=, affectionately known as Kolya ru=Коля ru_rm=, was a Corporal in the Fatui's Ninth Company, which went on an ill-fated mission to investigate the strange occurrences at The Chasm: Underground Mines The Chasm. He was an orphan raised in Arlecchino's House of the Hearth, alongside his sister Katarina Katarina Snezhevna.
He was presumably slain by a Shadowy Husk after getting separated from his team.
Profile
Nikolay was an orphan raised in the House of the Hearth, an orphanage run by the Harbinger Arlecchino, alongside his sister Katarina.A Company Vanishing Into the Deep He was presumably also familiar with Lyudochka Snezhevna, a fellow orphan raised at the House of the Hearth and whom Katarina describes as someone who was "even dearer than a real sister" to her.Lost in a Foreign Land: Seeking
Story
Sometime before the Ninth Company's deployment to The Chasm, Katarina was transferred into the regiment. Upon learning the news, Nikolay wrote her a letter expressing his joy at being reunited with her. Katarina kept this letter on her person up until her disappearance and presumed death in search of him.
During their investigation of The Chasm, the Ninth Company faced disastrous results. Many soldiers became casualties of the Abyss monsters,Perils in the Dark and the Mokosh Device, which was designed to absorb Abyssal corruption, was overloaded and destroyed. The team that encountered the Chasm Nail and attempted to break the Abyss' hold over the Nail inadvertently awoke the Ruin Serpent known as Haftvad the Worm and were forced to hastily retreat after incurring significant losses.Wherefore Did the Spiritstone Descend?Fatui Action Logs
In the chaos, Nikolay used himself as bait to lure away a group of enemies away from his squad and disappeared. While Staff Sergeant Anton believed he was a lost cause, Katarina refused to give up on finding her brother and stayed behind in the depths of The Chasm while Anton's group moved back up to the The Chasm: Main Mining Area main mining area. Katarina got lost, however, and set up camp in The Glowing Narrows, where the Traveler and Paimon eventually found her.Lost in a Foreign Land
At Katarina's behest, the Traveler searched for Nikolay, but only found fragments of his diary. The last fragment they found recounts his severe leg wound and ends with his discovery by a Shadowy Husk, with his final words an acknowledgement of his impending doom and an apology to Katarina. The path the Traveler found was blocked off by fallen rock, preventing them from investigating further, so they brought back his diary fragments to Katarina. She decides to investigate his last known location herself, but when the Traveler arrives, Katarina is nowhere to be seen while his treasured letter lies abandoned on the ground.</text>

<title>Aranara</title>
<text>The Aranara are a race of plantlikeGadget: Aranyaka (Gadget) Aranyaka I: Woodland Encounter, "Vanagni"Interactable: Zandik's Legacy, Zandik's Legacy Ragged Records Ragged Records forest spirits who primarily reside in Vanarana (Subarea) Vanarana in Sumeru. They are encountered in the Aranyaka.
They were led by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata - whom they called "Queen Aranyani" - up until her disappearance.Arakarman
After Lesser Lord Kusanali erased the memory of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata from the Irminsul during the Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies, like any Teyvatian creatures, the Aranara also forgot her as Queen Aranyani. With this revised history, they believe that they are the children of the current Dendro Archon, whom they refer to as The Lord of Verdure.
Overview
The Aranara have lived in Sumeru at Old Vanarana until the cataclysm occurred. Many Aranara fought fiercely against the invaders of the Abyss, but they were forced to abandon their old home and made a new home at Vanarana (Subarea) Vanarana.
At some point prior to the events of the game, the Traveler's Sibling met with the Aranara, who referred to them as the "Nara Varuna." They helped them with the Varuna Contraption prior to their departure, after which they told them to expect another golden-haired human who would give them even better memories.
The Aranara do not normally trust most humans, especially adults, though they befriend children and are often referred to as a myth as no adult had ever seen them with their own eyes before. The Aranara relate this to a sense of mistrust in adults and thus deem them as "grown up", who try to say goodbye to their younger selves but rarely succeed. They see children as those who had not "grown up", though they have made a few exceptions to this should they deem them trustworthy, such as Rana and Yoimiya.
Powers and Abilities
All Aranara are capable of hiding themselves from the human eye, although they are only seen by children, most likely due to the fact that they dream, whereas adults do not.
Being attuned with nature, Aranara are also capable of communicating with plants and fungi (e.g. mushrooms like Rukkhashava Mushrooms, not the monsters called fungi).
Aranara love memories, although some of them are prone to forgetting quite easily, so some Aranara give flowers to their friends so they can remember them if they meet again. They can draw on the memories to gain power to use from the plants of the forest, known as Mystic Arts in Teyvat Sumeru Ararakalari. Every Aranara has their own Ararakalari, which can be used to fight enemies, restrain or suppress their strength, teleport across great distances in an instant and even block several areas off.
Every Aranara has their own tune, and every tune is different, so the Aranara know who's home.The World of Aranara Each tune can be played by the Traveler with the Vintage Lyre.
Other Types of Aranara
These Aranara can be found in the wild. With the exception of Mischievous Aranara, all type of Aranara listed below require completing the The World of Aranara to be found or interacted with. Once interacted with, they will provide a reward, then leave for Mahavanaranapna (the dream version of Vanarana), where they can be found. There are a total of 64 such Aranara spread throughout various areas of Dharma Forest, Sumeru.
Confused Aranara
Confused Aranara
Confused Aranara (14 total) appear in odd locations in a hunched position. They can be awakened by applying Dendro onto them. Afterward, if they are interacted with, they will reward 5,000 Mora and a few Sumeru Materials.</text>

<title>Light Realm</title>
<text>The Light Realm, also known as the realm of the elementsOthers Light Realm and the Vishap Realm, is one of three realms in the world of Teyvat. The Light Realm is host to creatures that harness the pure, raw, primordial elements, also commonly known as elemental beings.The Byakuyakoku CollectionThree Realms Gateway Offering: The Eve It is diametrically opposed to the Abyss Void Realm and also incompatible with the Human Realm without adjustments being made to increase compatibility.
Overview
The Light Realm is the place of origin for all pure, primordial elemental beings. The most prominent inhabitants of this realm are the Vishaps and their elemental lords, the Seven Sovereigns, which is why it is also called the "Vishap Realm."
Since the beginning, the Light Realm and the Abyss Realm have been diametrically opposed to one another until the arrival of the Primordial One. The Primordial One and its shades defeated the Seven Sovereigns and established the Human Realm,The Byakuyakoku Collection interposing itself between the two.The Subterranean Trials of Drake and Serpent The three realms each have their separate but analogous concepts: the Human Realm's Ley Lines, the Light Realm's elemental currents, and the Void Realm's dark currents.
After the defeat of the Seven Sovereigns, both nature and the Light Realm fell under the dominion of humanity. While elemental beings and creatures of the Human Realm are normally mutually incompatible, it is possible to make each other more compatible; vishaps were eventually modified to accept Orobashi's Bloodbranch Coral, whereas the Coral Butterfly Sangacorallia (or Sangocorexes) can break down the Light Realm's pure elemental energy into something more compatible for the Human Realm.Coral Butterfly However, the Void Realm is wholly incompatible with either realm and is highly dangerous to both, while the Light Realm's energy vanquishes the darkness of the Void Realm. As a result, despite their hatred towards humanity, the vishaps lent humans its aid against the encroaching Void Realm after Enjou tricked them into disrupting the balance of the three realms in Enkanomiya.Three Realms Gateway Offering: Aftermath</text>

<title>Gurabad</title>
<text>Gurabad, also known as the city of brassMysterious Parchment and City of Kings,The First Days of the City of Kings was an ancient city located in the southwestern part of the Desert of Hadramaveth in Sumeru.Interactable: Zandik's Legacy, Zandik's Legacy Ancient Work Log Ancient Work LogInteractable: Zandik's Legacy, Zandik's Legacy Akademiya Investigation Team's Interim Report Akademiya Investigation Team's Interim Report It arose after Nabu Malikata's death and fell before King Deshret's forbidden knowledge incident.
It was led by Ormazd before his murder via Liloupar's machinations, after which it was ruled by Parvezravan.The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin Parvezravan himself was later killed by his son, Shiruyeh, and Liloupar's usage of Abyssal power caused most of the city to fall into a deep chasm while a plague claimed the lives of most of the city's population.Memories of Gurabad Afterwards, the city was abandoned and the few attempts to revive its former glory ended in ultimate failure.
Its ruins still lie in the desert, where a massive Ruin Golem (similar to the one found in Devantaka Mountain) is located. Sumeru Akademiya conducted an expedition to Gurabad in the distant past, which was mentioned in some of Zandik's notes.
Story
History
Gurabad was established after a shepherd named Ormazd gained the favor of King Deshret and the Jinni Liloupar, and used Liloupar's blessing to unite the desert peoples.Legacy of the Desert High-Born Although Gurabad prospered, Ormazd grew corrupt with power and perpetuated the slavery which Liloupar had expected him to abolish. Her sense of betrayal led her to plot Gurabad's downfall over the course of three generations, using her own children to perpetuate the city's destruction.
Liloupar's daughter with Ormazd, Shirin, was married to Liloupar's son Kisra - whom she had left as an orphan and was adopted by Ormazd - after Kisra had performed many great accomplishments for Gurabad. Ormazd bestowed him with the title of Parvez, making Kisra's name "Kisra Parvez." Using an unwitting Shirin as her pawn, Liloupar had her daughter deliver poisoned honey to one of Ormazd's banquets, which resulted in the deaths of Ormazd and all of Shirin's other siblings. Shirin went insane upon realizing what had happened,Dune-Entombed Fecundity: Part III while Kisra took the opportunity to take the title of king for himself, adding the title "Ravan" to his name and becoming "Kisra Parvezravan."The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin
As king, Parvezravan turned to Liloupar for a method to gain even more power, and she gave him the idea of creating Jinn-powered machines. Parvezravan forced Shirin to create mindless Jinn to power these machines, which were then used to replace the slave labor that was used in Gurabad. These slaves, left without a means to make a living, were easily swayed into joining the "Brass Mask" rebellion led by Khorramdin - who was actually Parvezravan and Shirin's son, Shiruyeh, who had been banished from Gurabad by his father for being a potential threat to his reign. Liloupar gave Shiruyeh her support, appearing before disgruntled workers and former slaves under the guise of aiding them in their time of need.
Eventually, Shiruyeh amassed enough followers to launch an open rebellion. The exact details of what happened afterwards are unclear, but Liloupar used the power of the Abyss as the final part of her revenge, causing Parvezravan to turn into a monster while much of Gurabad was swallowed into the earth, including Shirin and Shiruyeh. Shortly afterwards, a plague arose from the chasm and killed half the inhabitants of Gurabad.
Legacy
Because Liloupar's machinations were unknown to the people of Gurabad - albeit suspected by her fellow Jinni FerigeesInteractable: Nameless Tablet Nameless Tablet (VII) Nameless Tablet (VII) - Liloupar is largely presented as a neutral figure in renditions of Gurabad's downfall, whereas Shirin was vilified despite having little to no awareness of her actions due to her insanity. The fall of Gurabad and the plague that came after it was known as "Shiruyeh's Plague," and Shiruyeh himself was dubbed the Lord of Pestilence. Ever since then, the name "Shiruyeh" came to be associated with cowards and exiles.
Khaenri'ahn automatons,Vimana Agama: Jazari's Chapter including a Ruin Golem identical to the one in Devantaka Mountain, can be found in Gurabad. Zandik noted that the parts he found around Ardravi Valley could be used to repair the machines in Gurabad. It is currently unknown why Khaenri'ah sent Ruin Golems to Gurabad and Devantaka Mountain specifically.

Timeline The New World
* >6000 years ago - Morax, a god with dominion over Geo, is born.
* ~6000 years ago, while Morax was young - The Solar Chariot falls to the west of what is now Dunyu Ruins, creating The Chasm (Subregion) The Chasm. This prosperous mining area would sustain the Dunyu area for thousands of years, up until the cataclysm 500 years ago. The tribespeople in the area repair it and eventually it returns to the sky.
** In alternate versions of the tale, the Solar Chariot is not a literal chariot, but is instead a star which fell into the area now known as The Chasm and returned to the heavens of its own accord during the Archon War.
Pre–Archon War
Guili Assembly
Guili Assembly
'Note: The two main sources of information about the Guili Assembly, Stone Tablet Compilations: Vol. I and the World Quest Treasure Lost, Treasure Found, currently contradict each other on whether Guizhong or Morax descended on the land first and which one moved to the area afterwards. Because Stone Tablet Compilations has more information corroborated by other in-game sources,Stone Tablet Compilations names Morax as the co-ruler of Guili Plains alongside Guizhong, which is confirmed by the table at Mt. Aocang and the description for Memory of Dust. It also briefly mentions the Guizhong Ballista, which was not within Soraya's scope of interest during Treasure Lost, Treasure Found. the wiki will assume it has the correct version.'
* ? years ago - Morax descends on the region of Liyue, where he raises Mt. Tianheng, quells the seas, and lowers the tides. To pacify the seas, he defeats many sea monsters including one beast known as Baqiu. Jueyun Karst was created in such a way at an unknown point in time, with the water being drawn into an underground reservoir.
* ? years ago - Guizhong, the Lord of Dust, befriends Morax. At some point, she and her people move north of Mt. Tianheng for reasons unknown. Morax and Guizhong establish the Guili Assembly, which derives its name from the first character of Guizhong's name, and one character of Morax's (using his name at the time, which is unknown). This civilization spanned the area between Mt. Tianheng and Stone Gate. It was extremely prosperous, flourishing under the trades of agriculture and mining, and became a trading hub.
** Guizhong establishes four commandments to guide her people:"To unite in ambition is to be steadfast and immovable for all time.""Wisdom is like water, it nourishes all those who receive it and in it is a reflection of the truth.""Fortify the bones, that movement be supple when the time comes.""Virtue grows tall like a tree, though there be shade it will flourish forever."
** Guizhong and Cloud Retainer, among other adepti, create the Guizhong Ballistas to defend the Guili Assembly from external threats.
Lisha Civilizations
'Note: It is unknown whether the Sea God truly existed or whether he had any link to the Lisha region, but his story and the legends regarding Lisha seem to have some relation.'
* ? years ago - Early civilizations in the Lisha region of Liyue are established at Dunyu Ruins, Lingju Pass, Qingxu Pool. At some point either before or during the Archon War, the civilizations at Lingju Pass and Qingxu Pool were destroyed and submerged underwater, only reemerging after the end of the Archon War.
** 'Legends say that these ruins predate the Geo Archon's rule over Liyue. The whole of Lisha was covered by water at the time of the Archon War, and back then this rocky outcrop was nothing more than a little islet that rose above the water's surface. After peace was restored, the region of Lisha unfurled once more as the tides withdrew, revealing the ancient buildings erected by the early peoples.'
** 'What [Soraya] told me was that these ruins were left behind by an evil god, whose name has been wiped from the record, and its people. But in the end, the sea gave way to forests and fields, the self-serving god was defeated, and the strongholds and temples of the ancient city the god's people once built were left to crumble. That is how Qingxu Pool came to be. The ruins were submerged until the long Archon War finally came to an end, emerging on the landscape as the tide subsided."'
* ? years ago - The Sea God gives his people a year without storms and tsunamis in exchange for a human bride. After many generations, one such bride - whom he had permitted to return to the surface world - caused the destruction of her village after she asked for the Sea God's aid when her daughter was to be taken away from her to be offered as his bride.
** '"The Sea God looked majestic indeed as he sat center stage in his giant clam, holding in his hands the reins of two sea serpents. They stood as imposing as Mt. Tianheng before the royal carriage as their master accepted the gifts of pearls from the village elders and welcomed his new bride aboard the carriage. In return, the village would receive the Sea God's blessing: a year free from tempests and tsunamis."[...] The Sea God responded to the call, rising up from the billowing waves to greet the village. But his embrace was a tidal wave that engulfed the village, and took the villagers and elders in their sleep.'
Other Regions of Liyue
* ? years ago - Havria, the God of Salt, establishes her domain in Liyue; the original expanse of her territory is unknown, but it included Sal Terrae. She was known for being gentle and kind-hearted, but weak. It is theorized that Liyue's flower ball wedding tradition may have derived from Havria's act of handing out bunches of flowers to her followers.
* ? years ago - The village at Wuwang Hill is established. It would exist in relative peace until some time after Liyue Harbor was established, after which the bewitching song of a whale-like sea monster (potentially the Oceanid Rhodeia of Loch, considering the monster's physical description and current location) led all the youths of the village to their doom, and its elders died with no one to carry on the village.
The Archon War (?–2000 years ago)
section=1 Timeline archonwarstart
The Fall of the Guili Assembly
* 3700 years ago - One particular battle occurs in the Guili Assembly - despite being a nation protected by Morax, Guizhong, and the adepti, it ravages Guili Plains and causes landslides that transform Dihua Marsh from a fertile islet into a swamp. Guizhong is also slain in the process. The exact cause of its destruction is unknown and many theories exist among Liyue folklore.
** >10 days laterThe English localization says "a dozen days," whereas the original Chinese text says 十多天 tl=over 10 days. - Following the fall of the Guili Assembly, Morax, Marchosius, and the adepti lead their people south of Mt. Tianheng, where they establish Liyue Harbor. Morax creates a contract with the adepti to defend it.Character Demo:
** The Millelith Millelith Brigade is established to protect the people and defend against monsters.
** Morax teaches his people how to create houses, using Mora to create a model home. He also establishes minted Mora as Liyue's currency, for convenience.While Rex Incognito mentions that people once used jade plaques as currency, the unnamed nobleman - a disguised Morax - reveals at the end of the book series that he made up the story about the jade plaques, likely with the intent of seeing whether it would be taken as fact generations later.
** After creating Liyue Harbor, Morax decides to wage war against the other gods, seeing it as the only way to restore order and protect humanity.
*** '"He sought celestial order, to stay the tide of turbulence.Adepti rallied round him, yaksha guardians charged ahead,Frightened by the courageous people the demons fled."'
*** '"I wish not for dominion, yet I cannot watch the common people suffer."'
* December 2, >3000 years ago - Sometime either before or during the Archon War, Ganyu is born. She later participates in the war to protect Liyue Harbor, signing a contract with Morax.
** There are no details on when exactly she was born, however it is speculated that Ganyu may have been alive during the Guili Assembly era based on the wording in her third Character Story.
** During one battle, Ganyu - who was much more rotund during this time - unintentionally chokes a monster to death when it underestimated her girth and tried to eat her. This incident has led her to maintain a strict diet in order to keep a slim physique.
* >2000 years ago - Morax hears the pleas of Azhdaha, a blind Geo elemental dragon who dwelt beneath the mountains of Nantianmen. He takes pity on the dragon and takes it aboveground, bestowing sight upon it with just a touch. They form a contract, where Azhdaha agrees not to endanger humanity in exchange for living alongside them. Azhdaha then aids Morax in battles across Teyvat.
* 3700–2000 years ago - 'The following events presumably occur sometime between Liyue Harbor's establishment and the end of the Archon War. The events are listed in a tentative chronological order, but there is no confirmation on when exactly they occurred relative to the present.'
** During a certain battle in the Archon War, the opposing god slashes Mt. Tianheng, creating a crack in the mountain's foundation and threatening to collapse on the village at the base of the mountain. To prevent this, the adeptus Skybracer has a friend cut off his antlers - a gift from Morax himself, made of his divine essence and thus the hardest material in Liyue - and uses them to prop up the mountain. This act causes the mountains to elevate higher than it had been originally. Skybracer then continues to fight until he dies from blood loss, his blood turning into the Bishui River. The people who lived at the base of the mountain held him in high regard for this action, even more so than Morax.
** Havria, whose gentle nature and weak martial prowess put her at a disadvantage during this brutal era, futilely attempted to peacefully resolve the conflicts that erupted. Realizing it was too late for anyone to stop, she turned her efforts to creating a place of refuge for humans displaced by these wars. However, due to her relatively weak powers, she stood no chance against other gods and chose to make concession after concession, until she lost all her lands besides Sal Terrae. There, she created a small city with her followers - but they, seeing that she had no chance of surviving through this war, decided to give her a swift and painless end rather than consign her to defeat at the hands of other gods. However, the power that surged from her body after her death salinified the city and its inhabitants, while her own body withered away into a small salt flower.
*** Her followers who managed to escape salinification were scattered across Liyue after the loss of their god and home. Many went to Liyue Harbor and eventually became Yinyuan Hall of the salt industry, one of the Eight Trades. Some descendants of those people, fearing Havria cursed them for their ancestors' betrayal, risked their lives to enter Sal Terrae and break the sword used to kill her. By the time of the present, however, Havria's story has been twisted among the people of Yinyuan Hall, and they now believe she was a powerful god who was assassinated by Morax out of envy.
** Morax defeats many gods and sea monsters at Guyun Stone Forest, including the ancient god Osial, by throwing down massive stone spears to pin them to the ocean floor, and using Sigils of Permission to seal them. The resulting stone formation, when viewed from above, takes the general shape of his own Geo symbol.
*** ~2600 years agoIt is unclear whether Chi was defeated at this time or if the seals were established years after its defeat, but the seal at the highest point of Mt. Qingce has a statue facing a "wind-swept ruin," which is Stormterror's Lair Decarabian's capital city. As a result, the seals must have been established after Barbatos' rise as Anemo Archon 2600 years ago. - Chi (in the ancient language, Qingce) makes its nest in the area now known as Mt. Qingce and takes over the region. Morax fights it at a "great height" and succeeds in subduing it.
****In fantastical Liyue legends, although Zhongli (Morax) reveals they are merely the product of people's imagination, Chi and its nest transform the area around Mt. Qingce into its current state after its death - its body turns into stone, its blood becomes water, and its scales turn into terraced fields. Even after its death, however, Chi's power seeps into the land, creating the Blood-Fed Trees and suspicious orange stones at Bishui Plain that poisoned the area. To suppress its power, Morax seals its remains in five different locations with Geo Seals and water to prevent its revival.</text>

<title>Thousand Winds</title>
<text>The Thousand Winds is a term that has appeared in legends and historical texts of Mondstadt and Enkanomiya. It has been used to refer to the following:
#Istaroth, the God of Time, also known as "the thousand winds of time" or simply "the thousand winds."Hydrological Studies in Byakuyakoku
#Personifications of the winds that protect Mondstadt, including Barbatos (Venti).Skyward AtlasShould You Be Trapped in a Windless Land (Quest)
Overview
Sources differ on what exactly the Thousand Winds encompass or represent. In Enkanomiya beliefs, Istaroth is the personification of "undying wind" and the phrases "the thousand winds of time" and "the thousand winds" refer to her and the power of wind.
In Mondstadt, where worship of Istaroth seems to have faded out and been forgotten, "the thousand winds" is currently interpreted as the literal winds and clouds in northern Teyvat, each of which were allegedly given names and personalities through the Cloud Atlas and serve as Mondstadt's protectors.Skyward Spine Venti was originally a "single thread of the thousand winds" before he amassed power and eventually rose to godhood and the position of Archon as Barbatos. Venti's power over wind is referred to, both by himself and by various descriptions in the game, as calling on the power of the thousand winds.Dragon StormSkyward Harp
The Thousand Winds Temple, on the other hand, preserved some of the worship of the "god of Time"; the carvings on the sundials at the Thousand Winds Temple and the Nameless Island leave messages associated with both the god of Time and the god of Anemo:
'"Seeds of stories, brought by the wind and cultivated by time."Stories brought on the wind will bloom into legends in due time."'
This can also be confirmed with the Ragged Notebook (Time and Wind) Ragged Notebook written by the missing
friend of Henry Morton, and the weapons in the Sacrificial Series:
On the cliff facing the eastern sea, the ancestors worshipped the masters of Time and Anemo together.The two are intimately related, as expressed in the saying, "Anemo brings stories while Time nurtures them."Rituals took the form of performances, [...]A group who could bear the cold no longer built a shrine high on a clifftop in the east.

<title>Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri</title>
<text>The Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri ja=海祇御霊祭 ja_tl=Watatsumi Spirit Ritual is a ritual conducted on Watatsumi Island to prevent the erosion of the island's soil, using a Jade Coral Branch broken off from the depths of Enkanomiya.The Moon-Bathed Deep (Quest)
The World Quest series The Moon-Bathed Deep completes the prerequisite steps for entering Enkanomiya.
Overview
According to legend, the depths of Enkanomiya attempts to absorb the spirit of Watatsumi Island, which causes the soil to bleach and erode, making the land infertile and unable to grow crops. Soil that has been affected turns white and is known as "Holy Soil." By performing the Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri, the spirits in Enkanomiya will be forced back down into the ocean and the erosion will be temporarily halted.
A piece of Bloodbranch Coral Jade Coral Branch from Enkanomiya is required to perform this ritual. To enter Enkanomiya, the seals on four Goshou Rocks - the Eye, Tooth, Fin, and Tail - located around Watatsumi Island must be broken to retrieve the Spirit Pearls. The Spirit Pearls are then used to unlock the fifth Goshou Rock, the Heart. Solving the puzzle and defeating the enemies in the Heart rewards the Key of the Deep Key of the Moon-bathed Deep, which allows one to enter Enkanomiya."Heart of Watatsumi"
The Jade Coral Branch was created from Orobashi's own body and is used to suppress the Dragonheir of the Depths. Tsuyuko believes that the threat of unsealing the Dragonheir is a possibility, but due to insufficient knowledge about what lies in the depths, there is no way of ascertaining the truth of these legends.
Tsuyuko's studies at the Sumeru Akademiya have given her a more scientific explanation for the origins of Watatsumi Island's soil erosion and the reason for the Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri's efficacy in preventing it. She believes that Holy Soil is caused by the salinity and alkalinity of seawater that touches the land, which leaches nutrients from the soil and renders it unsuitable for agriculture. Jade Coral Branches, which were created from Orobashi's body and contain its power, have sufficient nutrients to replenish the soil and stave off the spread of Holy Soil.</text>

<title>Liyue Script</title>
<text>The Liyue Script ('unofficial name') refers to the writing system of Liyue.
The script is inspired by real-life Chinese characters, particularly seal script. Such script is common in Liyue Harbor around shops and other businesses - there is a very high degree of repetition of these symbols between shop signs.The sign for the Zhongyuan Chop Suey stall, the sign for the unnamed building next to this stall, the sign for Xigu Antiques and all legible characters on the scrolls, the signs for Yanshang Teahouse, the sign for the Dockyard, the signs for Mingxing Jewelry and all characters on the scrolls, the sign for Northland Bank, the hanging banners in Bubu Pharmacy, and the books at Wanwen Bookstore all share the same eight symbols. Notable exceptions are the last symbol on the banner for Wanmin Restaurant, and the symbols for Wanwen Bookstore. Other examples of this script can be seen on the Jade Chamber Intel Wall during the animated cutscene in the Zhongli's Treat and on bulletin boards around Liyue.
Appearances
This script appears in several other Liyue character's Elemental attacks including: around Chongyun when Spirit Blade: Chonghua's Layered Frost is active, and when Zhongli's Dominus Lapidis Stone Stele breaks.
A stylized (or ancient) form of the Liyue script appears in Beneath the Dragon-Queller on the ground around the seal after Azhdaha is defeated.
Deciphered Characters
There are few instances where characters in this script that have been deciphered and determined to be based on existing Chinese characters. In most cases, the characters closely correspond to seal script, an ancient form of the Chinese writing system.
A few characters appear in the center of the seal at the entrance to Beneath the Dragon-Queller. They are used to indicate which element Azhdaha will be Beneath the Dragon-Queller Elements infused with and are based on the Chinese seal script of these Elements: Electro (雷), Hydro (水), Cryo (冰), and Pyro (火). Note that the character for Electro has been simplified from its seal script form (靁) by replacing the 畾 portion with the symbol for Electro Electro.
Four characters also appear when Yanfei's Seal of Approval Charged Attack leaves an impression on the ground. These characters have been interpreted to be based on the Chinese glyphs for 福 tl=blessing, 祿 tl=prosperity, 商 tl=business, and 印 tl=seal" or "stamp (right to left, top to bottom).Reddit:  The symbol identified as 印 is in fact identical to one seal script form of the character, while the other characters seem to be highly stylized.The symbol identified as 印 has not been seen in the game prior to Yanfei's release. The three other characters appear throughout Liyue.
There is also another Chinese character found in the game, which is the one on the Unusual Hilichurl's mask. This character is 伟 tl=Wei, the name of the CEO of MiHoYo. This character, however, does not seem to be in the same style of script.

<title>Tighnari/Lore</title>
<text>An Avidya Forest Watcher and botanical scholar who graduated from Amurta. He leads a fruitful life of patrolling the rainforest, protecting the ecology, and lecturing fools every day.
Personality
A young researcher well-versed in botany who currently serves as a Forest Watcher in Avidya Forest. He is a straight shooter with a warm heart - and a dab hand at guiding even the dullest of pupils.
Being a Forest Watcher, Tighnari is highly knowledgeable about various species of both plants and animals, particularly flowers and mushrooms, having grown an interest due to studying his parents' books when he was young. He spends a great deal of time in Sumeru's rainforests, studying various species of plants and ensuring that the ecosystem is healthy and balanced. As the Chief Officer of the Forest Watchers, he takes his job very seriously and offers advice to those willing to listen and sternly lectures those who don't. He is very loyal to those whom he considers his friends and cares about them very deeply.
Due to his Valuka Shuna heritage, Tighnari is particularly sensitive to weather, disliking the wind and thunder. While his kind used to live in the desert, Tighnari, having a darker shade of fur (which he attributes to his kind migrating to the forests), is notably unable to tolerate the desert heat, causing him to suffer from heatstroke faster than others. He acknowledges this as one of his weaknesses.
He serves as a mentor to Collei, who in turn sees him as a Master of some sorts and holds him with high regard. He places a lot of value on knowledge, and thus oversees her education seriously, ensuring that she understands the content to the best of her ability. While he is friends with Cyno, he does not appreciate his jokes, having been exposed to many unfunny jokes and considers them embarrassing.
Appearance
Woodland Song
Tighnari uses the Medium Male Characters medium male model. He has fair skin, chin-length dark green hair with black roots and light green streaks at the front, and pale-pupiled eyes that fade from brown to green. He also possesses large, pointy black ears and a fluffy tail in two shades of dark green.
Official Introduction
Tighnari:Lushness follows the fox in the forest
A message for you. I brought back a specialty from the desert, two packs of honeyed dates, which helps to replenish your energy, whether in the morning or at night. Thank you for your patience in teaching and taking care of Collei. Good luck with your work and best wishes for Collei's studies.
People who encounter misfortunes in the Avidya Forest are lucky to meet a Forest Watcher named Tighnari.
But if you land yourself in trouble due to foolish antics, you might have mixed feelings meeting Tighnari.
Tighnari resolves problems quickly and professionally, but at the same time, he will give the other party a stern lecture.
As the saying goes, those who underestimate the rainforest will get taught a lesson by it, and those who underestimate a Forest Watcher will eventually face the teachings of the "Wilderness Survival Skills Lecture."
These are all rumors, but in reality, there is no need to be too stressed when encountering Tighnari. Anyone with a clear head will be able to comprehend his easy-to-understand explanations.
As for those who are set in their ways-
"What a pity, I majored in botany, and helping people grow a brain is not my area of expertise."
Character Stories
Those who travel through Avidya Forest will sometimes meet a rather special Forest Watcher.He has large ears, a long tail, and a slightly delicate face. If a less discerning eye were to appraise him, he might even look like some kind of small, rare animal native to the forests.But anyone who has even been acquainted with him will know that there is clarity to his words and steadiness in his bearing."One moment, please. Judging from your equipment, you're a traveling merchant bound for Sumeru City, aren't you? Come back, please, you're going the wrong way.""I mean, just look over there. The leaves are dense and the air grows damper. That doesn't seem like the main road leading to the city, no matter how you slice it.""Oh dear, your waterskin is empty, isn't it?""Come, let me share some with you. Being in a rainforest is no reason to skimp on your water supply.""If you drink any old water you find out here, you might next find yourself at Bimarstan, you know?""Of course, if that is part of your itinerary, then I suppose you have... interesting opinions."Amidst the flurry of instructions, the lost lamb will have all the arrangements made for them before they know it."Um... Thank you so much! Still, uh, might I ask who you are...?"As the other Forest Rangers look upon the traveling merchant bowing to the diminutive Forest Watcher, they cannot help but laugh."Pfft-haha! Ahem. This is our G- Well, Forest Watcher Tighnari."
Other than the most basic of forest maintenance, the Forest Rangers will often encounter a great number of problems whose origins lie in human hands:Arbitrarily occupied camps, shacks built by the destruction of vegetation, domestic waste dumps that may become sources of pollution, bonfire embers that have yet to fully be extinguished...In response to such situations, they must not only solve the problem at hand but also try to admonish the perpetrators, and yet these exhortations are not always accurately communicated.This would improve greatly after Tighnari joined the Forest Watchers.Part of this is his scholarly rigor - the way in which he will unceremoniously "teach" the troublemakers.But more importantly, Tighnari is able to communicate the correct way to act and the reasons behind that in a manner most comprehensible to those he teaches.The way he sees it, these crafts of living out in the wilds are also knowledge, and that getting people to accept knowledge is an art in and of itself.It is far more useful to be straightforward about the other part's errors and what is at stake as opposed to dryly giving advice.This is also why Tighnari has disagreements with the Akademiya's purveying of the Akasha Terminal.Knowledge is, in truth, the treasure of all living things. It should be passionately embraced by those who are curious about it as opposed to becoming a tool for survival, doled out in limited amounts.Unfortunately, as a young researcher, Tighnari did not have anywhere near the clout to stand against the Akademiya, and even now he can only do what he can in a limited capacity.At the same time, reality does not quite match up to one's ideals-As such, some unlucky soul getting lectured by Tighnari is no uncommon sight in Avidya Forest.
When Tighnari first arrived at Gandharva Ville, he was still a normal member of the Forest Rangers, no different from any other Forest Watcher."Rather than taking part in all these babbling debates about all these 'big ideas,' I might as well change the forest for the better in a practical manner, using what I’ve learned."-This was how Tighnari originally felt when he first joined the Forest Rangers, a fresh graduate from the Amurta school who had parted ways with the Akademiya.But he soon discovered that the Forest Rangers had significant problems of their own.They were passionate about protecting the forest, yes, but the organization as a whole lacked rational structure and instruction with any measure of scientific rigor.Alas, change could never come without any difficulty, and yet Tighnari was never good at leaving things to rot.As such, the highly active Tighnari leapt into action to turn things around.He created a rationalized forest patrol log, assigned tasks according to each person’s strengths, and regularly conducted natural history training for his fellow team members...With the enthusiastic cooperation of his fellow rangers, the forest patrols around Avidya Forest grew ever more effective, especially around Gandharva Ville, where it could be said to be perfect.Naturally, this knowledgeable and highly active researcher would become someone whom the Forest Rangers looked up to.One day, Tighnari would discover that he had a new name amongst his colleagues."Hey there, General Watchleader! Could you look over the journal entry I wrote for today?""General Watchleader! I’ve found some baggage down in the Chinvat Ravine. I've placed at the lost and found section.""Oh no, where has Sag gone... Um, General Watchleader, have you seen it around?"He at first took this for slips of the tongue, but many recurrences later, this sign would see his brows burrow."Do we actually have that rank? Or are we going for something similar to 'General Mahamatra'?"Whatever the case, Tighnari would eventually prevail upon everyone to go back to calling him "Forest Watcher," "Master," or "Mr. Tighnari.""I'm afraid 'General Watchleader' is too great a title for me to bear," or so he said."Heh, that actually reminded me of a joke someone once told about the title of 'General Mahamatra'..."He did not make mention of this other reason for his refusal of that title.
There was a time when a certain vibrantly-colored flower was all the rage amongst the people of Sumeru. Many people would buy it to adorn their houses, and thus it gradually became a trend.Unfortunately, this flower was not long for the world if removed from the rainforest, and would only last two days at best if so plucked.Flowers that were no longer fresh would soon be discarded, left by the wayside to rot - a shame by any standard of imagination.This could not go on. Never mind the garbage or pollution-related issues, this trend ran the risk of damaging the forest ecosystem if it persisted long enough.However, just as the Forest Rangers were mulling over this problem, Tighnari would send out an offer of cooperation with the flower sellers in the city:The Forest Rangers would help them gather fresh flowers for free, but that they should provide an additional service, informing those who came to purchase the flowers that if they sent them back by the second day, they would obtain a receipt that could then be exchanged within the next 3 days for a dried flower decoration.These decorations were of course provided by Tighnari and the Forest Rangers. The option to pay for them and how much to pay would be left up to the buyer of the flowers, just as things might go at a charity bazaar.Part of this Mora would go to the store owner as service charge for collecting the leftover flowers, and the rest would be used for funding the Forest Rangers' efforts to maintain the rainforest.This cooperation went quite smoothly indeed. The flower shop owners saved themselves the trouble of searching deep within the rainforest for their floral quarry and got some extra income; the Forest Rangers got to control the process and amount of flowers gathered, and also got some extra funds; those who bought flowers would not only receive a temporary flower as a companion, but also a more permanent memento.This all went quite swimmingly, but some rangers did not understand, asking: "Why didn't we just ban the gathering of such flowers in the first place? Wouldn't that have been simpler?"Tighnari shook his head when he heard this answer, causing his ears to shake."We shouldn't make such simple calculations. If we were to force our requests through, we would be just like a stolid lecturer who fails to have others understand, but who stirs up feelings of rebellion instead.""If that were to happen, our reputation would be the least of our woes - we would have our hands full trying to deal with those who were coming to pick flowers illegally!""In any case, trends will change. Don't worry. I'm sure the people's attention will shift to something else soon."Pragmatic as these words were, they quickly found traction with the Forest Rangers. Collei's nods were particularly rapid."The dried flower decorations that Master taught us to make have been pretty popular with the children, too!"
Beings of Tighnari's race are a rare and unpredictable sort, and usually give off the impression of being loners.But Tighnari's circumstances appear to have been somewhat different.Although he has spent much time meditating on his research and has spent comparatively little on cultivating relationships, he did wind up stumbling into a good number of comrades nonetheless.Tighnari had excellent grades in the Akademiya early on, and many would come to him for help with their coursework. When his seminar courses would end, he would often go along with requests for group photos.Not that he really understood them, but he agreed anyway.That was how "Tighnari knows everything, and he's so nice to talk to!" became a widespread saying, causing many to fight for his time. Even students from other Darshans would want to collaborate with him.This went on till one day, when his popularity also attracted the attention of the General Mahamatra Cyno-Forming factions and gathering forces... these were nothing if not the harbingers of academic corruption!Yet with some time spent observing Tighnari, Cyno found that the former had only received people out of the goodness of his heart.Tighnari himself only really had eyes for his work, and was dispassionate concerning the offers of others.Certainly he would agree to collaborate, but only in the interests of furthering his research in the best way possible.Ultimately, Cyno's judgment was as such: "This is an upright and reliable talent who has no questionable dealings. Threat resolved.It was perhaps due to this pure impression that the General Mahamatra, known for distancing himself from scholarship and scholars alike, would let down his guard and become friends with Tighnari in the days to come.These factors would all culminate in yet another meeting with another comrade."This young lady's name is Collei?""It's okay if you can't read or write. We all start having no knowledge - in this you are no different from anyone else.""Shall we start with writing your name, then?"
All who love research share the enjoyment of performing that research and a curiosity for the unknown.This is also true of Tighnari, and indeed, his curiosity seems to have been with him since birth.While children his age were still reading fairy tales, Tighnari was already flipping through crates and shelves in his parents' study.From his father, who studied insects, he would take general textbooks, and from his paleontologist mother, he would borrow some images of fossils.Thus did Tighnari absorb all this knowledge, whether he understood it or not, while hugging his tail.Slowly, however, he found that as his knowledge increased, the unknowns that he wished to explore also grew more numerous.For example, why were other people born without ears and tails like that of his family?Flipping through all the ancient tomes he could find in his home, Tighnari discovered a manuscript left behind by an ancestor of his that concerned "Valuka Shuna."As the records claimed, Valuka Shuna were a race subject to the Scarlet King, and who dwelled in the vast desert, mostly possessing light-colored fur and large ears that were excellent at dissipating heat.Later, calamity would descend and destroy the Scarlet King's realm, with the Valuka Shuna only surviving due to the grace of the Dendro Archon, which turned their fur green."It is worth noting that while Valuka Shuna were noted to have been more like foxes, the meaning of their name was 'large desert dog.'""According to a human friend of mine who has a very close relationship with the forest, it was a little creature known as an Aranara that gave them this name.""Oh my," Young Tighnari thought in shock, "so I'm a 'large desert dog!'"To be more precise, it was the fact that his ancestors had lived alongside the Valuka Shuna that they did end up inheriting some of their traits.But of course, such technicalities were of no importance to an excited child. Thus did Tighnari immediately ask his father to bring him - the 'large desert dog' back to the desert to have a look on his next surveying trip.Unfortunately, they met with an accident. Not a few meters into the desert, Tighnari fell into a faint from the heat and had to be rushed back to the rainforest."Oh no," Tighnari thought sadly as he convalesced in his treehouse, "the 'large desert dogs' have devolved in my generation."Many years later, the ignorant child had become a reliable researcher, and this event had become a joke consigned to the past.Nowadays, Tighnari not only knows why those little Aranara gave them this name, but also why he faints easily from the desert heat.The former is simple. Foxes and dogs are, biologically speaking, both canines, so the Aranara might have viewed them as interchangeable.As for the latter, though Tighnari is loath to admit it, it probably had something to do with what his father said then as he tousled his hair."This lad's fur is an intensely dark shade of green. He's going to have trouble in the desert heat for sure!"
When little Tighnari would explore alone in the rainforest, he would carry a magnifying glass with him.That was a gift from his mother. Light and cogent in design, it could immediately be recognized as a tool suited for children."Your ears can already help you hear sounds from reeeaaally far away, so let this magnifying glass help you see smaller things!"Thus did Tighnari use this device to see the veins on the back of leaves, the powder that hung off butterfly wings, and the trails of the rainforest snakes...It was through this gradual observation, collection, and consideration that he was eventually admitted into Amurta early, beginning his official learning journey under the Sage there.Tighnari placed the magnifying glass, scarred and weathered by many years of use, on top of his brand new invitation letter, placed his hands on his cheeks, and thought for a good long while.Finally, he had this constant companion of his converted into an ornament that he might wear on his person.He knew that once he entered the Akademiya, he would study more complex books and access more marvelous instruments, and that there was little place for this old beginner's magnifying glass.However, it would always be his companion in his search for knowledge, and would follow him to see lands wider and vaster still.
Academic conferences are unavoidable at the Akademiya, no matter whether one is here to learn or work.Those at the podium will wax lyrical, and those in the audience will give their support. This sight is most commonplace at such conferences.But strictly speaking, what researcher, adrift amidst the vast sea of information, will not make mistakes in their investigations?At one such conference that Tighnari attended, one speaker spoke of things that Tighnari knew to be untrue.Then, he was just a bystander and a listener. Glancing around his surroundings almost subconsciously, he noticed that neither his classmates nor his teachers had said anything.What should he do? Perhaps everyone indeed knew what the problem was, but did not want to make the speaker lose face.Or perhaps he was the only one who had noticed the problem, and his silence now would cause misinformation to spread...But Tighnari did not hesitate long before steeling himself.Though both his status and the scene were obstacles in his path, the rigor of knowledge eventually won out.After all, knowledge was like a star blazing through the night sky. Nothing would divert its path.So thinking, Tighnari raised his hand-"My apologies. If I may interject-"The researcher onstage was at first a bit shocked to hear his gentle voice, but reacted swiftly and invited him to elaborate.As it turned out, Tighnari had done the right thing.The speaker, after having processed enough of the information, accepted his corrections earnestly.And once their exchange had ended, other students and teachers in attendance would also speak in their turn, leading to new research angles opening up for the topics discussed at the conference. Tighnari himself would also receive namecards from some well-known researchers.Once the whole incident was over, Tighnari would heave a sigh of relief.That was a fortunate... No, indeed, a joyous thing that those who studied alongside him also accorded knowledge the gravitas it deserved.But he had not yet counted on something still more fortunate and joyous to occur.When the meeting ended and Tighnari stood to leave, he heard a crisp, clear "clink!"-Lo and behold, a Vision rolled off his garments onto the chair below.

<title>Ormazd</title>
<text>Ormazd was a historical figure in the Great Red Sand, Sumeru. He was the king of Gurabad, husband of Liloupar and the father of Shirin of Gurabad.
Profile
The shepherd Ormazd gained the Jinni Liloupar's favor, fell in love with her and with her assistance, united many desert city-states under Gurabad's control. She warned him that her blessings will be repaid with "sharp retribution," but he ignored those warnings. He became an ordinary tyrant instead of the enlightened ruler which she hoped he would  become, and so Liloupar plotted to impose him with three generations of ruination.The First Days of the City of KingsLegacy of the Desert High-Born
Liloupar gave birth to a daughter, Shirin. Before she delivered her into Ormazd's hands, she prophesied three times: First, she would fall in love with a hero and their child would surpass their father; second, that Shirin's relatives would meet a "sweet end;" and third, only Shirin would be given possession of Gurabad. Liloupar's admonitions for Ormazd were that: First, Shirin's joy would "bring tears to her father's eyes;" second, they "should no longer feast at the same table as their daughter after she was wed;" and third, Shirin's child would be "an ill omen upon the king's land."The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin
At some point Ormazd adopted an orphan named Kisra. To reward Kisra for his valor, Ormazd bestowed him with the name "Parvez." He also gave Kisra his daughter Shirin's hand in marriage.The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin Kisra, who  came to learn of Liloupar's prophecies, held no genuine love for Shirin and simply used her as a means of gaining the throne. Embittered with her life, Shirin plotted revenge. In accordance with the admonitions he received, Ormazd forbade Shirin from attending banquets; she took advantage of this fact to have slaves serve him and all her siblings poisoned honey, killing them all at a grand banquet. With this, Kisra became king of Gurabad and took the name Parvezravan.</text>

<title>Diadem of Knowledge</title>
<text>The Diadem of Knowledge is a famous crown regarded as a valuable treasure in Sumeru. Wearing the Diadem of Knowledge is considered a great honor and was the right of the winner of the Interdarshan Championship for the last twenty years.
Appearance
'(To be added.)'
Lore
The Diadem of Knowledge is said to have been built by a famous craftsman "in ancient times" and is recorded in old books. It is also said to have "a secret that no one knows."Sachin's Article
A little over twenty years before the events of A Parade of Providence, after Sachin returned to Sumeru City disheartened from his years in the desert, he happened to be in a position to purchase the Diadem of Knowledge, and he sold many of his assets to do so.The following narration places Sachin's acquisition of the Diadem of Knowledge after his time in the desert led him to his disheartened conclusion about human nature:Sachin: Twenty-eight years ago, I came to the desert and lived there for eight full years. [...][...]Sachin: The things I witnessed there tormented me greatly. I wished desperately to find a way to save them.[...]Sachin: But in the end, I found that the answer I sought simply did not exist.[...]Sachin: After this realization, I could no longer see the meaning in anything that I had ever learned. Consumed by an overwhelming sense of emptiness, I could no longer bear to face life... and so I decided to bring my life to an end.Sachin: But before I went through with it, a strange twist of fate led me to come into the possession of this diadem, which has the ability to preserve part of one's consciousness. Into it, I placed my experiences, before requesting that the Akademiya manage my estate.It is more likely that Sachin sold his assets after he returned to Sumeru City than while he was still in the desert, as selling enough assets while in the desert would require Sachin either to be able to sell them while away from them or to have enough of them on his person in the desert, neither of which seem plausible. Sachin kept the Diadem of Knowledge in a storage room in his house, from which the other members of the household would begin to occasionally hear a high-pitched voice, presumably of unknown origin. Sachin himself would also enter the storage room and research the diadem non-stop for a period of several days.To Claim the Crown
Sachin eventually discovered that the diadem could "preserve part of one's consciousness" and "placed [his] experiences" into it before signing the contract to entrust or donate his properties, including the Diadem of Knowledge, to the Akademiya shortly before the next Akademiya Extravaganza.When the Curtains Close After the Diadem of Knowledge was donated to the Akademiya, it was added to the Interdarshan Championship to be worn by the winner of each competition in accordance with Sachin's wishes.Suspicions Aroused
The same year that the Diadem of Knowledge was donated to the Akademiya, an Interdarshan Championship was held. During the final round, Sachin revealed himself to Kaveh's father, who was likely mentally assaulted with Sachin's words and emotions via the Diadem of Knowledge.This conclusion is based on the mental experience that Kaveh has with the Diadem of Knowledge, as shown in 'To Claim the Crown', explained by Kaveh himself in 'The Arc of Intellect', and further supported by Kaveh's declaration in 'When the Curtains Close' that with the diadem shattered, Sachin's words will never hurt anyone again. Kaveh's father was negatively affected enough that an Aranara named Arakasyapa, who still remembered being taught how to read and write in a human script by Kaveh's father as a child, took away the Diadem of Knowledge and hid it in a tree hollow,"That Incident From Twenty Years Ago"'"That Incident From Twenty Years Ago"' indicates that after the final round, Arakasyapa hid the Diadem of Knowledge in a tree hole in order to protect the human who taught it how to read. 'The Contestant' suggests that the human was the same human who helped Aaru Village and died in quicksand. 'When the Curtains Close' shows that the human spoken of in 'The Contestant' is Kaveh's father, as deduced by both the Traveler and Alhaitham. where it would later be found by the employee who was in charge of the Diadem of Knowledge. However, the damage had already been done, and Kaveh's father fell into depression. His actions afterward due to the empathy and kindness in him that caused Sachin to take notice of him in the first place would eventually lead to his early death.The Contestant While the change in the personality of Kaveh's father was noticeable, his encounter with Sachin went unreported and undiscovered.
The Diadem of Knowledge was used in every Interdarshan Championship in the twenty years that followed, seemingly without incident. Sachin's consciousness in the Diadem of Knowledge, through which he watched every Interdarshan Championship in hopes of finding a suitable inheritor for his research and wealth,According to the excerpt of Sachin's words in 'Suspicions Aroused', Sachin stated that he would watch for suitable candidates in the Interdarshan Championship "[e]ach year." This conflicts with Wiqas's statement in 'Opening Festivities' that the Interdarshan Champion is held every four years and is seemingly supported by Kareena's statement in 'To Claim the Crown' that the Diadem of Knowledge "has been used in every Extravaganza," which occurs yearly due to the yearly Wisdom Gala. However, at the end of 'To Claim the Crown', Sachin says the reward of his wealth was meant to "draw out the worthiest of individuals," making it clear that he was specifically watching the Interdarshan Championships. remained undetected the entire time by everyone except Nahida.
In the Interdarshan Championship held during A Parade of Providence, Nahida enlists the help of the Wanderer to keep an eye on the competition and intervene if anything went wrong. During the opening ceremony, the Diadem of Knowledge was displayed, causing the Traveler - and only the Traveler - to have a vision of Sachin onstage when they looked at it.Opening Festivities Later in the competition, Sachin decided on Kaveh as his successor. In the final round, during which the participants fought to be the one to place the Diadem of Knowledge on a stand, Layla and the Wanderer hold the diadem without any noticeable effects. However, when Kaveh is finally in possession of the diadem, it begins leaking black wisps. Kaveh then hears Sachin's voice in his head and is mentally assaulted by Sachin's emotions and ideas, giving him a splitting headache.The Arc of Intellect When Kaveh places the diadem on the stand to complete the final round, an image of Sachin materialized.
Sachin's explanation of his research upset Kaveh, so he threw the Diadem of Knowledge to the ground, dramatically breaking it into pieces after it had survived for an indefinitely long time intact. After the Diadem of Knowledge was broken, the image of Sachin dissipated. When Kaveh talks about the crown's effects, he says it was like it was brainwashing him. According to Alhaitham, the crown appears to only have adverse effects on empaths and idealists who can understand Sachin's ideas, explaining why he was able to interact with Sachin's research and Layla and Wanderer were able to interact with the crown normally, whereas Kaveh, who is both of these things, experienced pain.
It is unknown what happened to the fragments of the Diadem of Knowledge, but they are presumably in the care of the Akademiya due to the value of the crown and the secret of the crown being exposed. However, Dori implies that the destroyed crown is now worthless.

Sumeru is one of the seven regions of Teyvat. It is the nation that worships Lesser Lord Kusanali, the Dendro Archon and God of Wisdom. It is renowned as Teyvat's center of learning for housing the Sumeru Akademiya.
Archon Quest Chapter III takes place in Sumeru.
How to Access
Access to Sumeru is unlocked after completing the The Outlander Who Caught the Wind. The Dharma Forest is directly accessible from The Chasm (Area) The Chasm, Liyue. Upon completing the Song of the Dragon and Freedom, a Teleport Waypoint located at Girdle of the Sands, supposed to provide quick access to Fontaine, can also serve as a quick access to the Sumeru desert.

<title>Tulaytullah</title>
<text>Tulaytullah, the City of Sapphire, was an ancient city-state in the Hypostyle Desert, Great Red Sand, Sumeru. Like most of the other city-states in the desert, it arose after the fall of King Deshret's civilization.
It was located at what is now the Garden of Endless Pillars.
History
Thousands of years ago, after King Deshret died and Greater Lord Rukkhadevata used her power to seal away forbidden knowledge, King Deshret's civilization fell and splintered into many smaller, human-led city-states.Key of Khaj-NisutXiphos' MoonlightBetween various weapon descriptions, including Key of Khaj-Nisut, Xiphos' Moonlight, and Wandering Evenstar, it is suggested that Rukkhadevata's suppression of forbidden knowledge and Deshret's sacrifice occurred thousands of years ago. The Vaguely-Readable Inscriptions unlocked by restoring Primal Obelisks corroborate that the city-states' history occurred after Deshret's death. However, the book 'The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin (I)' states that the city-states rose and fell after the fall of the original Ay-Khanoum (during which the Goddess of Flowers died) and before Deshret and Rukkhadevata regathered the people, which would ostensibly place it before Deshret's death. Among them was Tulaytullah, which was renowned as a city of wisdom and played host to the "wise Tighnarians."The Shepherd and the Magic Bottle However, nothing is currently known about the Tighnarians aside from their association with Tulaytullah.
An unknown number of years after the fall of the city-state of Gurabad, a man known as Shah Ramshahr built seven towers in seven areas, and the cities around them were known as the Cities of the Seven Towers. Tulaytullah, which was led by King Humayun during that time, was one of the seven cities.Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, Primal Obelisk Mausoleum of King Deshret, East (Underground) Mausoleum of King Deshret, East (Underground)Considering that two of the other known Cities of the Seven Towers, Gurabad and Ay-Khanoum, predated Ramshahr, it is likely - but unconfirmed - that Tulaytullah already existed before Ramshahr's rise. After Ramshahr's death, Humayun took Ramshahr's princess as his wife and became known as Humayun Gürkan Gurkan. Some years later, however, Humayun himself was decapitated at the city of Saleh during an event known as the Jinn Uprising. Tulaytullah's leadership following Humayun's death is unknown, but the city was stable enough that refugees from Garshāsp's city (after abandoning Gurabad) flocked to Tulaytullah after Garshāsp's death.Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, Primal Obelisk Mausoleum of King Deshret (Beneath) Mausoleum of King Deshret (Beneath)
King Saleb Dowleh, originally known as Goudarz, was somehow involved with Tulaytullah before his rise as king, although he later left the city to take up residence in Gurabad. Saleb Dowleh made an alliance with the Dharma Forest port city of Orghana (now known as Port Ormos),Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, Primal Obelisk Mausoleum of King Deshret, East Mausoleum of King Deshret, East although one of its Deys, Muzaffar, would later turn his back on both sides, killing Saleb Dowleh and his entire bloodline and deciding to permanently reside in the desert instead of returning to Orghana.
Muzaffar's descendant, Badanah,The Vaguely-Readable Inscriptions at Valley of Dahri and Sobek Oasis appear to contradict each other on Badanah's exact relation to Muzaffar. A literal reading of Valley of Dahri's inscription - which states that Badanah is one of the fifty sons of "Verdant Lord" Zumurud, Muzaffar's son - makes Badanah Muzaffar's grandson. Sobek Oasis' description says that "[Badanah's] father is most beloved of the Verdant Lord," which indicates that Badanah is not Zumurud's son and leaves Badanah's direct relationship to Muzaffar unclear. This could possibly be explained if Badanah's biological father was a male concubine of the Verdant Lord who adopted Badanah as a son because of Zumurud's stated fondness for his father. eventually united ninety-nine city-states under his rule, including Tulaytullah.Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, Primal Obelisk Sobek Oasis Sobek Oasis Faramarz and Makhaira, Badanah's son and concubine respectively, successfully enacted a plot to assassinate the king by luring him into a structurally unstable tower, which collapsed while Badanah was hunting with his falcon.Makhaira AquamarineLamp of the Lost In the wake of his death, the tower was dismantled while his hunting falcons were all killed and buried alongside him.Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, Primal Obelisk Khaj-Nisut Khaj-Nisut
Faramarz's Reigns
With Badanah dead, Faramarz took the throne. However, due to his relatively young age, Makhaira became queen-regent and gathered their retainers. Faramarz abdicated in favor of his uncle and minister, Balash, who was the master of Tulaytullah, and moved to the Emerald Palace. Later, one of Faramarz's other uncles, Goraz, raised an army to restore Faramarz's reign and succeeded in doing so, killing Balash. While Faramarz became king again, Goraz and Makhaira became co-regents and Goraz eventually took over the throne for himself, taking Makhaira as his queen and exiling Faramarz.
The people of Tulaytullah rebelled in the wake of Balash's death. Goraz was killed in the ensuing conflict, and Makhaira gave his head to the rebels to appease them. Faramarz returned once again to the throne, only for the city of Saleh to rebel to gain independence and re-establish their Khaganate. Once again, Makhaira handled the situation. However, this led to many other challengers for the throne, leading to a prolonged war which ravaged the land. While the war eventually came to an end and Faramarz reclaimed the throne for a fourth time, he assassinated Makhaira due to her shifting loyalties. A conspiracy between the slave-warriors and city dwellers led Faramarz to be ousted one final time, after which he was exiled to Dharma Forest. One of their retainers, who currently has not been named, was blinded and became a commoner.
Xiphos and the End of Tulaytullah
Tulaytullah remained prosperous after Faramarz's exile. One prince of a fallen kingdom, Xiphos, was spared from the carnage of war by being disguised as a servant. He retained the Key of Khaj-Nisut and eventually became an apprentice to the old blind retainer, who realized Xiphos' lineage from his story. The retainer encouraged Xiphos to continue on his journey and return King Deshret's glory to the world.
Wielding Xiphos' Moonlight a certain blade indwelt by a Jinni, Xiphos became Tulaytullah's protector and resided there for a while. However, he eventually became entangled in battle against another wandering mercenary who fell from the throne, who had accepted commissions from rival city-states that bore grudges against Tulaytullah and Xiphos. The mercenary emerged victorious, Xiphos perished in battle, and Tulaytullah withered without the wandering prince's protection.
Legacy
All that remains of Tulaytullah in the present is its garden, which is preserved in the Garden of Endless Pillars.

A collection of temple ruins that sits northeast of Mondstadt.According to local legend, millennia ago this area was a temple for worshipping the Anemo God. Though it has been left to waste for centuries, leaving the ruins you see today. If you look closely at some of the stone pillars, you can still faintly make out some elegant carvings.This long-forgotten symbol of commemoration is engraved with the maxim: "Wind brings the seeds of tales, time allows them to take root." , Genshin Impact Official Site
Lore
According to Henry Morton's notes found in the Ragged Notebook (Time and Wind) Ragged Notebook (during the quest 'Time and Wind')  the temple was associated with not only the worship of the God of Wind (Anemo Archon), but also the God of Time.
The Sacrificial Series of weapons were once used as props used in ceremonies at the temple, and their lore confirms Henry Morton's belief.Sacrificial Bow
The temple was built by people seeking divine intervention from the harsh blizzards caused by the conflict between the Decarabian, Lord of Storms; and Andrius, the Great Wolf King of the North.Sacrificial Fragments</text>

<title>Yaksha</title>
<text>Yakshas were a race of particularly fierce illuminated beasts,End of the Line (Quest) both in appearance and their martial prowess. To quell the lingering hatred of fallen gods from the Archon War, which caused plagues, curses, and miasmas all over Liyue, Morax called upon the yakshas to help. They waged a never-ending war against the monsters and other such manifestations of the gods' hatred.Yakshas: The Guardian AdeptiGlimmers of the Vigilant Yaksha note=Cutscene
Over time, this task stained them with karmic debt which wore away at their souls and sanity. Madness and despair overwhelmed the yakshas: Some turned on each other, others succumbed to the darkness, and yet others vanished. Now, only one yaksha remains: Alatus, who currently goes by the name Xiao.
Overview
Appearance
Unlike most of the Mighty and Illuminated Adepti who take on completely beastlike appearances, the yakshas seen so far have all taken humanoid appearances. However, they retain beastlike qualities through their masks and attire, and each is associated with an animal as well.Pervases, after his death, had his spirit indwell a crane statue, as seen in Insights of Drifting Dreams. His Chinese name, 铜雀 tl=Copper Bird, further points to his birdlike aspect.The Chinese name for Alatus is 金鹏 rm=Jīnpéng tl=Gold Peng (mythology) Peng, after the mythological bird. The tattoo on his right arm, which vaguely resembles a bird viewed from behind with its head in profile, depicts an illuminated beast and is related to his true form. (The full tattoo can be clearly seen on his .)
The Yakshas don Nuo opera Nuo masks during battle, although it is unclear if this is a trait shared by all yakshas or if it was exclusively used by the five foremost Yakshas. Notably, the symbols on their masks are cruder than, but still resemble, the elemental symbols of The Seven.
Powers and Abilities
Because Xiao is the only yaksha left in modern times, it is unclear how many of his techniques were common to all yakshas and how many are his personal abilities. For example, Xiao's Elemental Burst, Bane of All Evil, is the time-honored "Nuo Dance of Evil Conquering" used to purge demons and divine karma.The Purging of Evil Given that its Chinese name directly references Nuo zh=傩In the Chinese version, Xiao's Elemental Burst is named 靖妖傩舞 tl=Nuo Dance of Evil Conquering and its description says this is the technique's name, which is corroborated by Xiao's Xiao Lore Vision Vision story in both Chinese and English. However, the English version translates his Elemental Burst to make the term consistent with the way it was translated in his Xiao Lore Character Story 1 first Character Story, where it is used as a title to describe Xiao's experience and expertise in slaying demons. The English description for Bane of All Evil was altered to reflect the term's use as a title. and that Yaksha Masks are based on Nuo masks, it is likely that "Nuo Dance of Evil Conquering" was a technique practiced by several yaksha, each with their own version.
As adepti, yakshas are capable of performing adepti arts such as Dream Trawler, used for self-cultivation, and Mortal Lingering.Insights of Drifting Dreams Bosacius uses his arts to seal his treasures in the region of Minlin,The Yaksha's Wish although it is unclear which parts of the puzzles in The Yaksha's Wish were created using his arts.
Story
History
Yakshas were illuminated beasts of "dreadful appearance and warlike temperament" who "spared no brutality" to perform their duty. For this reason, the Geo Archon, Morax, called upon them to fight the demons that spawned from the remains of defeated gods after the Archon War. While there were many yakshas, five were considered the foremost yakshas for their strength and capability: Bosacius, Indarias, Bonanus, Menogias, and Alatus. Those five became known as the "Five Yakshas" zh=五夜叉, or simply "The Yakshas" zh=仙众夜叉 zh_tl=The Yakshas of the Adepti, with Bosacius, the eldest of them, as their leader.
Though strong, the yakshas were not all able to handle the darkness they faced. It's said that "some were given unto their rage, others unto a madness which fear mongered. Many turned to the slaughter of their own, others were bewitched by shadows of the soul." Of the Five Yakshas, Bonanus, Indarias, and Menogias all perished, while Bosacius grew weary of battle and left his treasures in the region of Minlin, only to later succumb to his karmic debt and go mad. During the cataclysm 500 years ago, monsters of the Abyss were sent by the people of Khaenri'ah to attack Teyvat, with The Chasm (Subregion) The Chasm in Liyue as one of their targeted locations. Despite his insanity, Bosacius was drawn to the bloodshed and fought alongside the Millelith in defense of Liyue. Because he no longer remembered his own name, legends of the battle at The Chasm referred to him as the "Nameless Yaksha."Tenacity of the MillelithVermillion Hereafter</text>

<text>Elemental Reactions in Genius Invokation TCG Genius Invokation TCG/Rules Elemental Reactions
Elemental Gauge Theory
Dendro Core
If a Dendro Core's duration expires, it will explode, dealing AoE Dendro DMG in a 5m radius to both enemies and players.
If Pyro is inflicted upon a Dendro Core, the Burgeon reaction will be triggered, which consumes the Dendro Core, and deals increased AoE Dendro DMG in a 5m radius to both enemies and players.
If Electro is inflicted upon a Dendro Core, the Hyperbloom reaction will be triggered, which transforms the Dendro Core into a Sprawling Shot that homes in on the closest enemy (or ally, if triggered by an enemy/the environment), dealing increased AoE Dendro DMG in a 1m radius on hit to both enemies and players.
DMG dealt to players by all Bloom-related reactions are 5% of the DMG dealt to enemies, no matter which party triggers the reaction.
Burgeon and Hyperbloom can both be triggered by a party other than the one which triggered the original Bloom, including the environment, and their damage scale with the stats of the party responsible for applying Pyro or Electro.
Bountiful Core
Certain character abilities and event buffs will cause the Bloom reaction to produce Bountiful Cores instead of Dendro Cores. Bountiful Cores explode 0.4 seconds after their creation, dealing AoE Dendro DMG in a 6.5m radius to both enemies and players. DMG dealt to players is 5% of the DMG dealt to enemies.
Burgeon and Hyperbloom cannot be triggered on Bountiful Cores. Bountiful Cores share the upper limit of 5 with regular Dendro Cores.
Talents
Damage
Note that one target can only take 2 instances of DMG from each Bloom-related reaction per source every 0.5 seconds, as limited by the Damage Sequence. Reactions triggered by a given character will not share this limit with reactions triggered by other characters. Note that Dendro Core explosions and Bountiful Core explosions are counted separately.

<title>Ganyu/Lore</title>
<text>The secretary to the Liyue Qixing. The blood of both human and illuminated beast flows within her veins.Graceful and quiet by nature, yet the gentle disposition of qilin sees not even the slightest conflict with even the most arduous of workloads.After all, Ganyu firmly believes that all the work she does is in honor of her contract with Rex Lapis, seeking the well-being of all living things within Liyue.
Personality
The secretary at Yuehai Pavilion. The blood of the qilin, an illuminated beast, flows within her veins.
Ganyu is usually very meek, mild-mannered, and reserved due to her half-qilin heritage, and is easily flustered. She also completes whatever is given to her, whether it be tasks or food, even if she is reluctant to do so.Chef Mao Privately, she tends to snap whenever people speak ill of Beidou or the Geo Archon. She greatly respects her fellow adepti, especially Xiao and Cloud Retainer, seeing them as a mentor and a maternal figure respectively, although she becomes extremely anxious in the latter's presence due to her tendency to unintentionally ramble.
Ganyu has served as the non-stopping secretary of the Liyue Qixing for thousands of years. The more important the task is, the more effort she puts into it, but she also becomes increasingly nervous and is more prone to making mistakes.
She has a huge work schedule, often working overtime and is prone to falling asleep. As a result, Ganyu has very few friends outside of work. Due to her age, she is very forgetful, and she often forgets important details which causes her much embarrassment. She is very sensitive about her horns, weight and childhood, becoming visibly flustered when any of these three are mentioned in front of her.
Appearance
Frostdew Trail
Ganyu uses the Medium Female Characters medium female model. She has fair skin and pale blue hair that naturally bunches in the middle and fades into a darker shade at the ends. She has black-red horns that bend back along her hair, similar to how a goat's horns look, with brighter red markings on them. She has eyes that appear to exhibit Heterochromia_iridum Sectoral sectoral heterochromia, fading from purple at the top to pinkish-gold at the bottom.
Official Introduction
Ganyu:Drink only spring water, eat only whole grain. Proceed with elegance, avoid certain peril.
It is said that the qilin carry an auspicious grace, yet who knows of the loneliness of a benevolent being among the sea of people?
For the Liyue Qixing of the lofty Yujing Terrace, Ganyu is not merely a companion to serve them, but is instead coordinator of the web of information that moves across Liyue Harbor, and the architect of administrative efficiency.
Complex meeting minutes, disorderly report data... Every day piles of documents flow by like water, each one personally compiled by her into clear and concise words in order to assist the Qixing's every decision and negotiation as they flow through various organizational departments.
In the eons that have gone by, the Qixing have changed with each succession of their posts, while only Ganyu has lived to see the flourishing of Liyue Harbor from beginning to the modern day.
The human blood that runs through her veins makes her reluctant to leave the splendor of the city lights, while her adeptus side leads her to yearn for the gentle serenity of her adeptal homeland.
For the half-human, half-adeptus Ganyu, between the bustling sea of people and the ethereal clustered peaks, which is more fitting to call home?
Character Stories
Though many in Liyue are fascinated by life in Yujing Terrace, its day-to-day operations and rules are a mystery to them.They are aware that the Liyue Qixing are the cream of the crop who hold the fate of the city in their hands, but the calculations and data behind the Qixing's every decision are far harder to grasp.The people understand that the new policies announced each year will change the dynamics of the market, yet none can comprehend how policy is plucked from complex meeting minutes and compiled into something easier on the human eye.As the secretary of Yuehai Pavilion, Ganyu undertakes many tasks that ordinary folk do not see.For those that have witnessed her standing by the dock at daybreak, enjoying her breakfast in silence, it is difficult to imagine her in such a post.Even still, by the time the sun has fully risen, she will have returned to Yuehai Pavilion overlooking Yujing Terrace, to continue to fulfill her contract.A contract that she signed three thousand years ago with Rex Lapis.
Ganyu is not the secretary of any one leader in the Liyue Qixing but is instead the general secretary for the entire organization. Under her gentle exterior, Ganyu is as persevering as stone itself. This was something that Rex Lapis, the leader of the adepti, noticed very early on. Thus when the Liyue Qixing first emerged ages ago, Ganyu was their secretary. Through the years and the changes in the Qixing's roster, Ganyu has remained by their side as a constant. This has also meant that the mountainous piles of paperwork from the various departments and bureaus in Liyue have fallen upon Ganyu's shoulders. But though her workload has increased seven, a hundred, or even a thousandfold, her sense of responsibility has never wavered. Someone once queried as to the source of her motivation and received an answer that was not quite congruous with the question. "What I've done... is nothing compared to what Rex Lapis has accomplished."
"I work for the well-being of all living things in Liyue."Under almost all circumstances, Ganyu is a very trustworthy secretary.It is hard to imagine anyone outperforming her in the face of such an enormous workload, especially given her unique and penetrating insights into all of Liyue's matters.Nevertheless, her reliability can only be guaranteed under "almost all circumstances."The more important the matter, the more Ganyu strives for perfection, and the more nervous she becomes. Under pressure, her nervousness does result in the occasional error.One such incident occurred during the Rite of Descension, without doubt the most important annual event in Liyue's calendar.Ganyu was three minutes late for the Rite and had to squeeze through the crowd in full view of all.Later on, with a face as red as a tomato, she stammered her way through an unconvincing explanation, all the while apologizing profusely to Rex Lapis in her heart.Her colleagues guessed that there must be some reason for the mistake.Those who did not know her well saw that Rex Lapis did not mind, and thus paid the incident no attention.Those closer to her worried in private, and asked if she needed a workload adjustment or a short vacation, but Ganyu refused."I spent two hours making sure that I wasn't wearing anything too similar to last year's Rite..."Needless to say, Ganyu was not about to admit to this being the real reason for her tardiness!
How long is a thousand years?Long enough for the Glaze Lily Glaze Lilies that once teemed throughout Dihua Marsh to be wiped out by floodwaters, and long enough for the thriving settlement that sprung up upon Guili Plains to come to ruin in war.How short is a thousand years?To Ganyu, it has felt shorter than the blink of an eye.Throughout a passage of time unimaginable to mortals, Ganyu has been working on all manner of things at Yujing Terrace.She recorded the raising and demolishing of every building, and witnessed the rise to prosperity of every industry.Ganyu's sense of objectivity towards the passage of time comes from the endless reams of data she must trawl through, and from the ever-increasing number of colors she finds that she needs to categorize it all.All this time, her mindset has never changed - she constantly wavers between her human and adeptus halves.On one hand, Ganyu the qilin finds it difficult to comprehend mortal squabbles.But on the other hand, her human blood reminds her always to hold out hope that she might someday be able to fit in.
Outside the confines of her work, Ganyu very quickly shows how different she is from most other people.She has a habit of taking afternoon naps and has a shockingly accurate internal clock. When lunch hour arrives, no matter where she is, she will simply curl up into a ball and fall asleep on the spot. Even the raucous dancing of hilichurls will fail to wake her.These habits were at first just a running joke within the Liyue Qixing.But once, after accompanying the then-Tianxuan to lunch outside the city, a well-fed Ganyu simply crawled into the nearest roadside haystack. She ended up being transported all the way to Dihua Marsh, awakening only after bumping her head during the unloading.Unable to find Ganyu anywhere over the subsequent three hours, and knowing that she would not depart unannounced, the Tianxuan almost filed a missing person report.After receiving a stern admonishment to "only take afternoon naps where it's safe," Ganyu retorted:"Well... isn't everywhere in Liyue safe?"Perhaps, with the mixture of human and illuminated beast blood flowing through her veins, Ganyu's understanding of the world's affairs is a little different to that of most humans.
Ganyu's qilin heritage is little-known in Liyue Harbor.Whenever she is asked by someone walking along Feiyun Slope as to the obvious protrusions in her hair, she says that they are ornamental heirlooms."If I told them the truth, they would distance themselves from me..."Despite never having been on particularly close terms with Liyue's citizens in the first place, Ganyu would still not consider distancing to be a good thing.Her more important reason for hiding the truth is to prevent curious onlookers from touching her qilin horns.After all, a qilin's horns are a sensitive part of their body, both physically and mentally speaking.Another secret that Ganyu is anxious to keep hidden is the fact that she is watching her physique.The qilin are strict vegetarians, but Liyue is a veritable powerhouse of gastronomical delights, one in which even vegetarians struggle to control their appetites.Ganyu, who has grown accustomed to city life, is thus very vigilant in matters concerning her weight and physique.Whenever she finds herself being drawn towards some delicious dish, she will attempt to reassert her self-control. For Ganyu, the difficulty of such a challenge is second only to finding a Flaming Flower atop Dragonspine.But she is not one to give up half-way through the ascent.During the Archon War, she once choked a giant monster to death with ease after getting lodged in its throat when it tried to eat her, said monster having fatally underestimated quite how wide her waistline was.For Ganyu, avoiding any similarly embarrassing episodes in the future is an absolute must.
Handwritten notes detail the morphological features and behaviors of the plants in Yujing Terrace, with each beautiful stroke penned by Ganyu's own hand.The notes are succinct, comprehensive, and well-categorized, and even offer some insights that one would be hard-pressed to find elsewhere on the market.These include pointers on caring for Glaze Lilies and methods for grafting Silk Flowers.In readability and scientific accessibility, they come close to the standard of official publications.Or rather, this is the experience if one starts reading from the front.Skip to near the end, however, and one may well be left dumbfounded.The final few pages are a shocking rash of black ink and frantically scribbled-out text.Reading patiently and painstakingly between the lines, one might just discover that these notes were, at one time, various methods for vegetable cultivation."But if I learn to grow vegetables, I'll be even less able to control my appetite."Her hands balling into fists, it was with much difficulty that Ganyu erased the results of her research.Later, whilst watering the plants on an empty stomach, Ganyu found herself plunging her head into a thicket of Silk Flowers, fantasizing that they were Sweet Flowers in an effort to comfort herself.Many more fantasy Sweet Flowers followed shortly afterward during her afternoon nap...
Qilin are paragons of benevolence among the adepti, drinking only freshwater and eating only plants. Flies they will not hurt, and a bruised reed they will not break. They do not travel abroad, do not gather in herds, and no trap will hold them. They are leisurely yet composed, active but reserved - a gentle and elegant race. Yet when a wicked beast from the sea arose and threatened the land beneath their feet, that peaceful life ceased to be an option. Three thousand years ago, Ganyu answered the call of Morax the God of Geo, aiding him in the Archon Wars. And when the war was over, she chose to stay in Liyue and help the humans build a better polity there. The first Liyue Qixing would need support, and she took this task up as a matter of course, becoming their secretary. The moment she made that decision, a Vision appeared at her hip, granting her power to resonate with the world to a degree beyond her natural abilities. Whether she would grow strong enough to no longer need it, or whether she would use it as a last resort in Liyue's defense... Regardless, she chose to serve as the bridge between adepti and humans. Her Vision, then, was proof and witness of her new duty.

<title>Albedo/Lore</title>
<text>Albedo - an alchemist based in Mondstadt, in the service of the Knights of Favonius."Genius," "Kreideprinz," or "Captain of the Investigation Team"... Such titles and honors are of no consequence to him when there is so much more research to conduct.The pursuit of fortune and connections cannot hold a candle to his heart's desire - acquiring the limitless, obscure knowledge left behind by previous generations of scholars.
Personality
A genius known as the Kreideprinz, he is the Chief Alchemist and Captain of the Investigation Team of the Knights of Favonius.
Having gained fame for his alchemical talents, Albedo is a reclusive person, spending most of his time in Dragonspine. He isn't fond of most social interactions and thus rarely travels to the city of Mondstadt unless it is to meet up with his fellow alchemists or other acquaintances. Yet he's also shown to at least be fascinated or interested in them in some way, often willingly appearing in events that have some sort of social setting going on and helping out the people around him in any way he can. While he does seem to enjoy company and seeing how people interact in a social setting, he finds relationships stressful and tiresome because of the amount of effort needed to maintain them. This doesn't mean he dislikes the relationships he has with others, he simply struggles with them and can get tired out from trying to keep track of everything to keep the relationship from falling apart. He prefers being around children, especially Klee, seeing her as a younger sister. Klee in turn sees him as an older brother figure.
Fueled by the feeling of enlightenment, he researches about the things that pique his interest, and once the feeling is gone, either by uncovering its truth or otherwise, he loses all interest, left with a bittersweet sensation in his mind. Along with his alchemical genius, Albedo is also a respectable artist. Having initially learned the talent as a way to help with his experiments, it is now a form of relaxation for him. He is Xingqiu's illustrator and regards him as a good author.
As much of a positive demeanor he gives off, the people of Mondstadt do not know anything about his personal life and he is particularly secretive about it towards them. To the Traveler, he does not mind sharing most of his secrets with them due to feeling a kinship of sorts as they are both not of Teyvat, him being an artificial lifeform and the Traveler a visitor from afar. He considers himself to be dangerous due to his knowledge on the Art of Khemia, something which Venti and Dainsleif are well too aware of.

Official Introduction
Albedo: The purest dust that gives birth to human life.
Albedo is so smart and gentle. He's super nice to me too! He always plays with the weirdest things, so I love following him around~!
Despite his great achievements in the field of alchemy, he does not speak of the nature of things too hastily.
Wandering among ordinary folk oblivious to various truths of this world, he treats them with nothing but sincerity and kindness.
Polite and graceful, he seems withdrawn on the surface, but never hesitates to lend a helping hand. No matter if you go way back, or he has just befriended you, he can always find time to draw an exquisite portrait for a friend.
The Chief Alchemist of the Knights of Favonius, Albedo, is a truly remarkable young man. All admire his scholarly attainments - citizens of Mondstadt and members of the Knights of Favonius alike.
"Genius," "Kreideprinz," or "Captain of the Investigation Team"... Such titles and honors are of no consequence to him when there is so much more research to conduct.
The pursuit of fortune and connections cannot hold a candle to his heart's desire - acquiring the limitless, obscure knowledge left behind by previous generations of scholars.
Character Stories
Alchemy is an ancient art, and many of its secrets have been lost to history. The few commonly known alchemy techniques of today are but enough to put some broken odds and ends together, saving you the money you would have otherwise spent on glue."Nay, alchemy is not so ignoble an art!" Or so most alchemists would protest.But as far as the average citizen of Mondstadt was concerned, that was alchemy.At least until the day Albedo suddenly appeared and decided to stay in Mondstadt.This young man displayed the true prowess of alchemy to all, bringing with him a massive corpus of wisdom that even the Sumeru Akademiya did not possess. "The universe is heaven reversed, and the earth is a dream lost to time. This is dust, the most basic form of complex life."As if to provide evidence for this claim, Albedo lifted the burnt ash of the flower that once grew atop a Dendro Slime's head.Seconds later, a Cecilia sprouted forth from the ash in his hand."And this... is new birth."
Albedo has a very important job within the Knights of Favonius but does not often appear in public.Still, he does not have the strange and eccentric temper that people tend to assume of academics. In fact, he is earnest in all his dealings.He is, however, of the persuasion that it requires more energy to maintain relationships established on excessive enthusiasm.As a result, Albedo's equivalent of friendship involves maintaining an appropriate degree of distance.Whether shutting himself away to work or traveling and gathering materials, no one in Mondstadt knows how to find him.Albedo's tendency to avoid social interactions does not make him a cold-hearted person.He is sincere and contented when instructing his assistants, Timaeus and Sucrose.He finds pleasure in giving his sketches to the citizens of Mondstadt.Yet he cannot help but feel sincere disappointment that Lisa, for all her great talents, has chosen to remain a mere Librarian.
"Albedo only got into Mondstadt because of his master's recommendation letter."On some level, this statement is true. Nevertheless, Mondstadt's gates are ever open to all, and a recommendation letter is not strictly necessary.Indeed, it could be argued that Albedo's life would have been far more comfortable without the letter.This is because the recipient of the letter was the famed travel writer Alice, an old friend of Albedo's master, Rhinedottir.After receiving the letter, Alice considered its requests."So Rhine said that you'll need a laboratory... And not one of a size that a civilian could build, either. Hmm... I know!"And just like that, she threw him into the Knights of Favonius.The work of the Knights is actually quite easy for Albedo - requiring only five percent of his energy.Albedo had imagined that the rest of his energy could be spent on experiments, with the Knights' full range of apparatus at his disposal.And yet...Alice had a daughter, named Klee.Yes, "that" Klee."We'll be a family from now on, treat her like a real younger sister!"From that day forth, remedying Klee's disasters would come to take up most of Albedo's remaining energy...
Albedo has no memory of any blood relations. From birth, he was already adventuring deep within domains with his master.Of course, Miss Alice, the Knights of Favonius, and that traveler who had a sense of the stellar depths about them... They are all important. And yet his master is unquestionably the most special to him.For Albedo, she is his only kin.She was a cold and strict woman who raised him and taught him the secrets of alchemy."The universe is the dark essence of the true starry sky, and the earth is the accumulated memories of time and lives.The chalk: that is you. The earth is where alchemy gets its name, and is the basis of all life. And this..."She demonstrated her technique before him as a huge life form burst from its culture tank in a shower of shattered fragments."...This is new birth."
Albedo once led a simple and content existence.There was no need for him to contemplate anything. Life was uneventful, its meaning consisted of nothing more than accompanying his teacher, doing what she asked of him, and meeting her expectations.But one day, deep in the heart of a dungeon, master and apprentice discovered an artifact known as Heart of Naberius The Heart of Naberius.And with that, his master disappeared, leaving naught but a note, a recommendation letter, and a classical text behind.Upon the note was written: "Albedo, go to Mondstadt. Find my old friend, Alice, and give her the recommendation letter. Then, complete your final assignment."The classical text was one of the last extant manuscripts of the Opus Magnum from his master's collection.If one were to push the definition a little, she had left him another gift - the title of Kreideprinz, and with it, a written acknowledgment that she had nothing further to teach him.In the past, Albedo's assignments had always been very difficult.He had always believed wholeheartedly that his master would make good on her threat to leave him, should he fail.But this assignment she had left to him was far too hard, far beyond the limit of his abilities.Did this mean, then, that he was fated to never complete it, and thus never see his master again?"Your final assignment: show me the truth and the meaning of this world."
The alchemy that Albedo commands is wholly different from any of the arts practiced in the Seven Nations of Teyvat.Its lineage can be traced back to the nation of Khaenri'ah.Khaenri'ah was an underground realm, with precious few natural fauna. As such, its alchemy focused more heavily on the creation of life.This art of creation was known as "Art of Khemia The Art of Khemia."Albedo had learned of this in his youth from reading his master's notes. The next stage after "soil" is "chalk," which was also something his master had mentioned."Chalk is the spotless soil, and was used to make primordial man."Now, Albedo understands alchemy in far greater depth than he did in the beginning, and his knowledge on the subject is far more comprehensive."From soil was birthed chalk."The profundity of this statement is well understood by Albedo now.Such ineffable secrets are bound up with his fond memories of his master.She was not his birth mother, but there is no doubt that his life stems from her."I hope this isn't just wishful thinking, but... when parents speak to their children about 'the meaning of this world'... surely they just mean the pursuit of a happy life?"From time to time, Albedo finds himself musing on this sentiment.
Albedo's interest in drawing and painting began back in the days of traveling with his master.At first, he would simply illustrate his notes with basic sketches. But he soon noticed that the process of rendering things in great detail helped him to intimately understand their physical makeup, which was of great utility to his alchemical studies.Additionally, it also allowed him to enter into a pleasant state of clarity, in which he needed only to focus on observation and creating his artwork, and nothing else.Eventually, Albedo became a master artist without ever having received formal tuition.When strolling through Mondstadt, he enjoys sketching and painting all manner of living things, but particularly people in moments of joy.Sometimes, he even gifts his artwork to his unsuspecting models, believing that when a work of art captures a transient moment of enjoyment, it is something worth treasuring.Albedo continued to refine his skills in this manner, going from strength to strength - until one day, when he was taken aback by illustrations from Inazuma.How was it that drawings of such generality could possess such narrative power?Amazed, he decided to give it a go himself....Eventually, after collaborating with a certain novelist by the name of Xingqiu, "A Legend of Sword" was printed and published.Unfortunately, it received lukewarm reviews, being lambasted as "a dictionary with divine illustrations."
Gaining a Vision came as no great surprise to Albedo.When he received it, he gave it a single glance before continuing to engross himself in his work.He barely felt any wave of emotion at all, as if this was something to be taken for granted.As far as he is concerned, his Vision is merely a tool with which he can more conveniently conduct his research.What truly sparks joy within him is turning the unknown into the known.One day, he will understand all there is to know about this world - and Visions are no exception.

<title>Yaoyao/Lore</title>
<text>A young adepti disciple who is generous and sincere. She is used to taking care of everyone around her. She trains under Madame Ping her master at Liyue Harbor and regularly travels between the mountains and the city. Although she does not say it outright, she prefers bustling city markets to the tranquil mountains.
Personality
Streetward Rambler's youngest disciple. A gentle and caring "little adult."
Yaoyao tries her best to act as a proper young adult to others including her seniors, such as making sure that they have a healthy diet and is especially fond of radishes. She is very curious about the outside world, having originally lived a life of seclusion with her parents around Qingce Village until she was taken in by Madame Ping. Similarly to Klee's Dodoco, Yaoyao is very attached to Raphanus Sky Cluster Yuegui, who Cloud Retainer made for her.
Appearance
Cherubic Osmanthus
Yaoyao uses the Short Female Characters short female model. She has fair skin, pale dark red eyes that are golden at the bottom, and golden-brown hair.
Official Introduction
Yaoyao: Cherubic grace blessed by the adepti
I wanted to give Yaoyao the magical device I used when I was younger, so she could protect herself. But before I could say anything, Cloud Retainer had already gifted Yuegui to her. Can't say I'm surprised. Yaoyao is a very lovable child after all.
In the eyes of the people of Liyue Harbor, Madame Ping always brings the smiley Yaoyao along with her, and the two behave like a loving grandparent with her grandchild.
In reality, they are not biologically related. Yaoyao is the disciple of Madame Ping, also known as Streetward Rambler.
Although she is the youngest disciple of Streetward Rambler, she takes care of her other seniors like an elder sister.
It is no wonder that Xiangling often finds herself thinking, "Why does it feel like Yaoyao is taking care of me like I'm a child... Am I not the older one here?"
Even before becoming an adeptus' disciple, Yaoyao was always a warmhearted and considerate child. Perhaps it is for this very reason that the adepti are all very fond of her.
Yuegui, who never leaves her side, is an adepti treasure, crafted by Cloud Retainer herself. Yuegui protects Yaoyao whenever she encounters danger. It is just another testimony of the affection that the adepti have for her.
Yaoyao is talented and driven, the kind of student teachers dream of. Although she has had some embarrassing moments due to her not fully grasping the knowledge learned, this young child will no doubt blossom into a cultured and knowledgeable lady.
Madame Ping is proud to have a disciple like her by her side.
Character Stories
The adepti faithfully adhere to the contract that they have with Rex Lapis, and have thus defended Liyue for millennia.When danger arises in Liyue, the adepti are sure to come forth, and they do show up from time to time when the land is at peace.Sometimes, they do so to punish those who harbor evil in their hearts, and sometimes they intervene to save the imprisoned. And if they happen to meet someone with a destiny intertwined with that of the adepti way, they will take them as disciples and teach them their arts.Amongst the adepti, Madame Ping Streetward Rambler is among those who interact more with mortals.She has a great many disciples, the youngest of whom is named Yaoyao.Yaoyao is both talented and inquisitive, and while she is still very young, thus limiting her ability to fully take in what she has been taught and causing no small amount of innocuous mistakes in the process, she will in time become a most knowledgeable girl.She also possesses a gentle and caring nature, and she treats people with earnestness and generosity. Not only does her master favor her, but Xiangling her senior disciple and other elders in her life, too, very much dote on her.Most will never have the fortune to enter the adepti abodes in Jueyun Karst, but Yaoyao comes and goes between them both freely and often. Indeed, the love she receives from the adepti at her young age is quite an enviable matter.
As the people of Liyue Harbor see it, Madame Ping is often found with Yaoyao by her side, the two seeming the very image of a loving grandmother and granddaughter.In truth, however, there is no blood relation between them, and Yaoyao is Madame Ping's - or should we say Streetward Rambler's - disciple.When Yaoyao first became the adeptus' disciple, she was still too young to have learned to read and write, and so her master began by teaching her the etiquette of tomes of poetry on a daily basis.As she grew, Streetward Rambler would gradually add the rites of the adepti, their methods of self-cultivation, and her own spear arts into Yaoyao's curriculum.The voluminous nature of such teachings makes committing them to memory a challenge for Yaoyao, but her master does not overly fret about such things, for it is apparent to her that Yaoyao has indeed listened to those lessons.While her spear's shaft is heavy and ill-aligned to a child's easy wielding, Yaoyao practices every day nonetheless.And while books of poetry might be hard to memorize, she reads them daily nonetheless, to the point where she can expound on the relationship between full stomachs and righteousness in her sleep.Having initially resolved to be a sterner taskmistress, Streetward Rambler was relieved to see Yaoyao's earnest attitude, and thus relaxed her requirements a little.That Yaoyao genuinely treated her as her grandmother warmed the cockles of her heart greatly as well.Indeed, despite being half the height of an adult, Yaoyao tended to Streetward Rambler's meals and fretted over her health when the hotter parts of the year give way to the cold, as if forgetting that headaches and fevers were not common problems for the adepti.Indeed, Streetward Rambler came to feel as if she really had been blessed with a granddaughter, and from then on, she never said a strict word to the child ever again.While she had not begun this relationship with any intention apart from taking a disciple, she now finds herself and Yaoyao inseparable. Which is alright, she supposes. Let the little one stay by her side for some time yet - she still has much to teach, after all.
This story begins well before Yaoyao was even born. Her parents, preferring life out in the mountain wilds, chose to move away from Liyue Harbor and search for a quiet place near Qingce Village to live, building their own abode and living life in relative seclusion.There they lived in solitude by the mountains and waters, and their backyard had a small field in which they grew melons, fruits, and vegetables.The closest settlement to them was Qingce Village, and when they lacked for any daily necessities, they would bring the fruits of their field to the village and trade for what they required.This was the home to which Yaoyao was born.Thus did she gain the birds, beasts, and fish for companions while she was still a babbling babe, and thus did she take her first tottering steps in the radish field behind her house.Her gentle, pure soul was first cultivated in this quiet and cozy garden.Later, she would catch the eye of an adeptus and be taken in as her disciple.At first, her parents were not entirely willing to let their daughter live long-term in Liyue Harbor with said adeptus, for they feared that their innocent daughter, having long been used to life in the mountains, would find herself led astray by the bright lights of the big city.But Streetward Rambler's counsel ultimately brought them round:"Perhaps solitude in the mountains shall indeed keep one from mortal stain, but such lonesomeness may not be what Yaoyao desires for her future. Let her have the chance to see the myriad faces of the world for herself."Only then did her parents give her into the care of the adeptus, and time has only demonstrated the wisdom of that choice.In Liyue Harbor, Yaoyao would become a much more outgoing person with the help of her master and a host of good friends. But when the festive season comes along, she does take leave of her master to see her parents at home.Indeed, if one desired a good teacher for one's child, could there be a more ideal pick than an adeptus?
Madame Ping's old acquaintances will sometimes drop by to visit her, and during such times, Yaoyao will accompany her master and her master's guests in roaming the city.Having come from afar, these guests will often not only visit the stores and food stands, but also attend storytelling sessions or Liyue opera performances at Heyu Tea House.Of course, being the large city that it is, Liyue Harbor has no lack of people who enjoy spending some downtime at the teahouse, including many outlanders who appreciate the cultures of other nations.Once, three outlanders, first-time visitors to Liyue Harbor, sat at the table beside that of Yaoyao and company. Having heard an opera about the adepti of Liyue, they began to discuss that very topic over tea and snacks.Unable to get a word in lengthwise in the conversation between her master and her guest, Yaoyao succumbed to boredom, listening in on the nearby chat while eating some treats.The lady from Inazuma seemed to think that Liyue's adepti were not much different from the Yae Miko Guuji of the Grand Narukami Shrine, having charge over matters divine and literary alike.The visitor from Fontaine was of an obdurate view that the adepti were in the employ of the state apparatus. Had he met Ganyu, the Qixing's secretary before? Or did that nation simply have a similar arrangement?The adventurer from Mondstadt was for his part very taken with the legends of the adepti, for he had only heard the bards sing songs of the gods, but had never himself met one or any of their familiars.Unable to resist, he asked the tea master if they had ever spoken to an adeptus, only to be disappointed by the reply:"It is but a story, for we mortals do not daily dwell in Jueyun Karst, and few are the opportunities to meet the adepti."Yaoyao, finding this statement to be incorrect, could not help but rebut thusly: "That's not true. The adepti are among us. I mean, Uncle Moon Carver just said that the story was very interesting."For some reason she could not fathom, Madame Ping's guest stopped speaking altogether, and Madame Ping laughed, saying a few words to the tea master to change the topic.Yaoyao, however, did not understand: Why did people find the adepti very distant from their daily lives? The adepti were amongst them - they just didn't readily reveal themselves, that's all.
Not all people can be accepted and taken as disciples by the adepti - only those whose destinies are entwined with these blessed beings may become privy to their arts and ways.Yaoyao once asked her master: "Why do you say that our destinies are entwined? What does that mean?""It means that you and I have things in common that led to our meeting."This answer, of course, was akin to some overarching axiom in a book, crushing much meaning into very few words, and has by no means been easy for Yaoyao to wrap her head around.Yaoyao remembers that she had been playing in the mountains as usual when she first met her master.At that time, she was still living with her parents, and when she went out to play, she would speak to the stones and the clouds about her feelings. In her eyes, the flowers, birds, fish, insects, and the mountains, rocks, and rivers were all her precious playmates.That day, however, the stones and the clouds replied when she spoke, and thus overjoyed, she chatted with them throughout the entire day.Then the adeptus recalled her mystical arts, and the illusory stones and clouds dissipated, revealing Streetward Rambler to Yaoyao in her true form - and yet, Yaoyao was not startled.It is the adepti way to protect the world and the people who live in it, and the adepti of Liyue do not merely defend humanity, but cherish also the things of nature. All such things are bound within their own natural cycles, and so long as one acts in concert with these cycles, all things will grow in their time and will not encroach upon one another.Yaoyao's treasuring of her playmates bore similarity indeed to the adepti and their care for all things, and it was this that drew Streetward Rambler's interest.Shame, then, that Yaoyao could not for the life of her comprehend the complexities of her master's reply, and thus did she lay the question aside for the time being.
After following her master to live in Liyue Harbor, Yaoyao has packed her daily schedule to the very gills. Her mornings are for readings and lessons, afternoons are for spear training, and afterward, it is time for single-minded play!Play, her master said, is not to be underestimated, and for a child like Yaoyao, learning and play are both right and proper things to do.It has been during play time that she has encountered all manner of people, among them the Beidou captain of the Crux Fleet, the Baizhu doctor at Bubu Pharmacy, and his Qiqi little herb-gathering assistant. As such, she has been steadily gaining a larger pool of people to ask about anything she may encounter that she might not immediately understand.She also loves to explore the harbor area: Granny Shan's Toy Shop toy stall, the establishment - that is to say, Wanmin Restaurant - run by Xiangling her senior disciple's Chef Mao family, the dockyards... If it may be explored, she would love to explore it.As such, she has seen many things that books cannot tell of, such as the sails of embarking ships rippling in the wind, or the full map of Liyue that may be found in Yujing Terrace - each one of these helps her perceive the vastness of the world around her.Sometimes, her idea of play will take her alongside her master to visit the Jueyun adepti. There she has heard many an ancient tale, and there she has learned that the truth of the past is far more perilous than any tomes may tell.Each day, she learns a little something more, and each day, things change all around her - nothing remains quite the same as it once was in life.This is her favorite thing about Liyue Harbor.Life here is like a long river, constantly moving forward at a great pace.By contrast, the days she spent with her parents are like a peaceful, quiet stream. The stream is wonderful, of course, and its gentle tread and slow rhythm has given her a great many warm memories.The great river is also good. She will take up its unceasing drive and work hard to become an adult who both her master and parents can be proud of.And so wishing, she grows expectant, wishing to grow up.
Streetward Rambler has acquaintances all across Liyue, and even early on, she had paid many of them a visit, saying that her newest disciple's training was not quite complete yet, and asking them to take care of the young girl should they encounter her.Her original intention was simply to introduce her student and ask that they help teach Yaoyao further, that her eventual learning might increase.Yaoyao's clever and caring manner, however, proved more lovable than Streetward Rambler had expected, and Cloud Retainer would take the request to heart.Before either master or pupil had realized it, Cloud Retainer had already completed the creation of a wondrous machine rabbit."Well then, Yaoyao, one purposes to give this to you. Should you encounter any danger, call upon it, and it shall answer."Yaoyao was very taken with this cute rabbit, naming it Yuegui and taking it everywhere with her.Having given this gift, Cloud Retainer would seek out the little girl's master to say, and not without pride, that:"One should inform you first that this device has another function. Should you ever be unable to find Yaoyao, you need only call out, 'Yuegui!', and her location shall be made known to you.""Nonetheless, one counsels you not to overuse this feature, for when the child grows older, she will desire her own privacy, and may yet take umbrage to your constant calling upon her. Now, take one's loose relationship with one's pupil Shenhe for example...""Oh, not to worry. I understand, Cloud Retainer.""And it is good that you do. In any case, Yuegui shall alert us if anyone should try to do her ill without our knowledge - any such churls shall soon need all the luck they can get."
"Why did I receive a Vision?"This question troubled Yaoyao quite a bit in the days that directly followed her receiving one.Did the gods want to reward her for the good deeds she had done? Or was this because she had been a good and respectful pupil?Speaking of which, her senior Xiangling and Aunty Cloud Retainer's student Shenhe both had Visions as well. So, was this because the gods recognized the adepti, and so they would, as a matter of course, also extend this acknowledgment to an adeptus' students?But on further consideration, none of these guesses really made much sense.It was with a sigh that Yaoyao found herself sitting on the slopes behind Liyue Harbor, hugging a dog that had followed her up the incline.This was hardly the first thing she had found incomprehensible since leaving her parents' side, and she had, by and large, decided that her doubts were unavoidable, and could wait till she got older, for surely they might clear up by then!But since she now had a Vision, an item that represented divine acknowledgment, she could not betray such hopes.As a disciple of her master, she would follow her example and protect the people. This meant that she would not only have to care for her master and senior disciple, but also extend care to her family and friends, and extend universal love to all people. Ah, she still had such a long way to go. Nothing for it, then - she'd hang on for a bit longer during spear practice tomorrow, and write one extra page into her calligraphy copybook too.

<title>Niwa Clan</title>
<text>The Niwa ClanKagotsurube Isshin was an Inazuman family and a practitioner of the Isshin Art, one of the schools in the Raiden Gokaden.
Overview
The Niwa Clan is distantly related to the Kaedehara Clan, although it is unknown how far back their shared lineage goes.
Over 500 years ago, Niwa Nagamitsu apprenticed under Futsu Masayoshi alongside Kaedehara Kagemitsu and Akame Mitsunaga. The three later became known as the "Isshin Sansaku," or the great three masters of the Isshin Art.Haran Geppaku FutsuThe Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call While the characters in 三作 literally translate to "three works," which is how the English localization interpreted its usage in Haran Geppaku Futsu's description, the term 'sansaku' in Japanese swordsmithing tradition refers to the swordsmiths themselves. Later, in Wanderer's Story Quest 'Inversion of Genesis', the English localization explains 'sansaku' to refer to the swordsmithing schools.
400 years ago, the head of the Niwa Clan was Niwa Hisahide, who was the Armory Officer at Tatarasuna. While Mikoshi Nagamasa was the Inspector at Tatarasuna, his yoriki Katsuragi discovered a masculine puppet inside Shakkei Pavilion and brought him back to Tatarasuna with him. Despite his human-like appearance, this puppet had no idea how to live like one, and so the bladesmiths at Tatarasuna took him in as one of their own, naming him "kabukimono" and teaching him all sorts of different things.The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call
However, as part of their machinations, the Fatui Harbinger Pierro sent Il Dottore to sabotage Tatarasuna and cause chaos that would bear fruit in the future. Under the guise of a Fontaine mechanic named Escher, Dottore contacted the Akame Clan and with their influence, successfully introduced a new smelting technique to Tatarasuna. This technique was designed in such a way that it released the Tatarigami inside Crystal Marrow, with devastating effect on the Tatarasuna area. Hisahide, who had been suspicious of "Escher" from the start and had people look into his background, attempted to sacrifice himself using a device which Escher promised would absorb the filth released into the area. However, Dottore murdered him and placed his heart into the device, then gave it to the kabukimono, telling him that the Tatarasuna workers had assigned him the task of cleansing the filth. Due to his physical constitution, the kabukimono survived the ordeal and afterwards, opened the device to find a withered heart. Escher claimed that Niwa killed a subordinate and placed his heart into the device, and had fled with his family for safety. Enraged by this perceived betrayal, the kabukimono left Tatarasuna bearing a deep grudge against the Tatarasuna bladesmiths. Meanwhile, Escher repeated this lie to the rest of the people at Tatarasuna. Nagamasa, as the next person in charge after Hisahide, would have faced capital punishment for the events that unfolded at Tatarasuna, so Katsuragi willingly took the blame - and the punishment - on himself.
Around 100 years ago, the head of the Niwa family disappeared and his son, Niwa Yoshinori, was adopted into the Kaedehara Clan. Yoshinori was later part of the group investigating Scaramouche's sabotage of the Raiden Shogun's Goshintou forging diagram. While pursuing the swordsmiths who fled out of fear of the Shogun's punishment, Yoshinori, the Yashiro Commission head, and their accompanying samurai were intercepted and defeated by Scaramouche. Upon noticing Yoshinori's appearance, Scaramouche questioned whether he had any relation to the name "Niwa." After receiving an affirmative, Scaramouche decided to spare them, leaving only a vague message: "Tell her this. My name is Kunikuzushi."The Palace, Dyed in Black (Quest) This event came to be known as the Case of the Eccentric.
Revised History
During the events of The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call, Scaramouche learns the truth of the Tatarasuna incident and erases his own existence in Irminsul in an attempt to change the past and save his friends, believing that the Fatui likely targeted Tatarasuna due to their interest in him. While he successfully erased himself from history, the ultimate conclusions to the events he was involved him remained the same, but occurred for different reasons.
Tatarasuna: A "mechanic" (presumably still Il Dottore) still interferes at Tatarasuna. Without the kabukimono around to be involved with the Fatui's plans, Hisahide and another swordsmith sacrificed themselves to save the furnace.
Case of the Eccentric: Rather than being a long series of machinations by Scaramouche, an unnamed swordsmith from the Hyakume School went mad and slew as many swordsmiths as he could, only being stopped after Commissioner Kamisato and Yoshinori successfully killed him.

Descriptions
In the Inazuman arts of sword-making, there is the tradition of the "Raiden Gokaden," five schools of the craft, of which the Amenoma Art is one. They will have no part in any cheap tricks in their smithing technique. Nay, they have only time for only boundless passion and willpower, which they pour into every hammer-stroke - thus are the Amenoma Art's works known throughout the entire Inazuman martial scene! Map description
Lore
There is nothing mystical to our work. There is only practice, day in and day out, until both body and mind have memorized the craft, turning each motion of every technique into an intrinsic part of the bladesmith's life.|Amenoma Tougo
The Amenoma Art is one of the five schools in the Raiden Gokaden, Inazuma's five bladesmithing schools. According to Amenoma Tougo, the Amenoma Art's difference from the other schools of the Gokaden is that it uses no special forging tricks, only sheer persistence and willpower, until its bladesmiths can internalize every technique to the point that it is an "intrinsic" part of themselves. He explains that the Art tries to emulate the "abiding patience and determination of water as it turns stone to sand."Through the Mist, a Name UnveiledAmenoma Tougo
After Iwakura Michihiro defeated Teruyo in a duel, he went on to establish the Iwakura Clan. He had the Amenoma master at the time forge a blade that would be passed down to each inheritor of the "In" title. This blade, the "Hakuen Michimitsu Amenoma," disappears following Iwakura Mitsunari's death during the Iwakura Art's Downfall, while the Amenoma Kageuchi, a second copy of the sword, was given by Doukei to the Saimon Clan and is later given to the Traveler.Amenoma KageuchiThe Farmer's Treasure
The Amenoma Art is the only school that emerged completely unscathed during Scaramouche's revenge plot against "the bladesmith," which likely refers to Mikoshi Nagamasa, whom he came into conflict with at Tatarasuna around 500 years ago.Calabash of Awakening

<title>Varka</title>
<text>Varka is the current Grand Master and Knight of Boreas of the Knights of Favonius. Half a year ago,As there are no requirements besides Friendship Level to unlock the story, it is assumed that it is "narrated" at the start of the Traveler's journey with Paimon. This is in contrast to certain character stories that require quest completion and are thus "narrated" no earlier than certain key points in the Traveler's journey. he departed on an expedition with eighty percent of the Knights of Favonius' manpower,Long Distance Love leaving Jean as the Acting Grand Master in his absence.
Profile
Based on other people's remarks about him, Varka is one of the strongest people in Mondstadt. Tartaglia calls him the "titan of the Knights of Favonius" and hopes to one day face him in combat, Barbara says that there's nothing to worry about as long as he is leading the expedition and Eula suspects that he had been intentionally holding back during a sparring session.
At some point before the Traveler's arrival in Mondstadt, Varka brought Rosaria to Mondstadt so she could redeem herself, although he did not appear to have expected her to do so in her own way. He also accepted Eula into the Knights of Favonius and met Razor in the forests of Wolvendom. Varka appeared to know Razor's parents, and he kept a box in storage that held some of his parents' mementos.
At some time after departing from Mondstadt, Varka learned of the Fatui plots in Mondstadt and deemed them outrageous. Prior to Weinlesefest, Varka sent Mika back to Mondstadt to inform Jean and the others who were in Mondstadt of the expedition force's status. In the letter, he explained how they meet Il Capitano and that the Harbinger had been sent to Natlan. Making use of the paper he had left, he also left a note for Lisa, having deemed it time for Razor to learn about his human parents.Sounds From Afar (Quest)

Little is known about Varka's appearance, but Razor's character stories and voice-overs suggest he is extremely tall.

<title>Gardening</title>
<text>Gardening is a subsystem of the Serenitea Pot. Through it, players can plant and harvest items such as Materials and Local Specialties.
The Seed Dispensary can be used to collect seeds to plant. The Seed Dispensary can be unlocked by completing the World Quest 'The Art of Horticulture', after reaching Inazuma Reputation level 3.
Seed Dispensary
Seed Dispensary
The Seed Dispensary allows the player to obtain seeds when gathering plants. When gathering plants with the Seed Dispensary, each individual plant will yield one seed.
Seeds can also be purchased from the "Creatures of the Realm" section of the Realm Depot.
Seeds can be planted in Landform Field fields inside the Serenitea Pot and harvested after 2 days and 22 hours. The harvested plants will not yield seeds.
While different fields with different seeds can be placed in each realm, swapping realm layouts will cause all planted seeds in the previous realm to stop growing. Effectively, only the plants in the player's active realm will grow, preventing simultaneous harvests across all owned realms. Swapping realms will not remove any progress or destroy any plants.
Each seed will grow into one instance of the construct that yields plants in the wild. For example, because Valberry Valberries are found in bunches of 4 in the wild, each Valberry Seed will yield a bush of 4 Valberries.
Seeds that yield more than one plant per seed can be used to obtain most of the achievements in A Realm Beyond: Series III faster. The following seeds yield more than one plant per seed:
* ×2: Silk Flower Seed, planted on A Path of Value: Luxuriant Glebe
* ×2: Harra Fruit Seed, planted on A Path of Value: Jade Field
* ×3: Jueyun Chili Seed, planted on A Path of Value: Jade Field
* x3: Lumidouce Bell Seed, planted on A Path of Value: Luxuriant Glebe
* ×4: Valberry Seed, planted on A Path of Value: Jade Field
* ×4: Zaytun Peach Seed, planted on A Path of Value: Jade Field
However, there is no way to speed up the achievement 'Stop! Gather Time.', which requires A Path of Value: Orderly Meadow.
After planting the seeds, the field will indicate the time remaining before harvest.
Once the plants have grown, they will appear as collectible items in the field. After harvesting, the player will then have the option to plant once again.
Fields
Fields can be bought from Tubby in the "Riches of the Realm" section of the Realm Depot, and one additional Luxuriant Glebe field is earned from 'The Art of Horticulture'. Up to 4 seeds can be planted in each plot at a time. Seeds take 2 days and 22 hours to fully grow.
Fields can be cleared before the plants are fully grown, but the seeds will not be returned.
Guests cannot harvest plants from the owner's realm.

<title>Il Capitano</title>
<text>Il Capitano, also known by his codename "The Captain," is one of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers.As only the First and Tenth of the Fatui Harbingers have not been identified, Il Capitano is very likely to be the First of the Fatui Harbingers due to Tartaglia's voice-over about him. However, Capitano's rank will be left unknown until it is officially confirmed.
He is currently in Natlan, where he has "thrown his hat into the nation's endless ring of war".Finale
He makes his first appearance during '' alongside his fellow Harbingers.
Profile
Capitano enjoys a high reputation amongst the Fatui, with Viktor stating that if he had the choice, he would rather work under Capitano.Tales of Winter
Wanderer, however, views such attribute negatively and points out that holding "absolute righteousness" is a potential hazard.
Appearance
Capitano has glowing dark blue eyes. Out of all of the confirmed Harbingers, he is the only one whose entire head is concealed.
Story
During Varka's expedition when Mika was accompanying them, the knights accidentally ran into several Fatui scouts, resulting in a tense situation where Capitano was eventually alerted of the situation alongside Varka. The two eventually met and agreed to peacefully depart, with Varka stating that he would have loved to duel him under different circumstances.
After Signora's death at the hands of the Raiden Shogun, a funeral for her was held in Snezhnaya. Capitano, along with the other Harbingers barring Scaramouche, was in attendance, where he questioned Il Dottore on the situation with Scaramouche and the Gnosis Electro Gnosis.
In-Game
During the event of 'Of Ballads and Brews', Varka's letter to the Knights of Favonius revealed that he and his expedition encountered Il Capitano. Despite the Fatui's previous transgressions against Mondstadt during the events of the Archon Quest Prologue, the two sides remained cordial to each other. At the time Varka wrote his letter, Capitano had just left for Natlan.Sounds From Afar
After Fontaine's Prophecy of Fontaine prophecy was averted, Neuvillette tells the Traveler that Capitano had joined the conflicts occurring in Natlan.

<title>Genius Invokation TCG/Lore</title>
<text>Genius Invokation TCG is a trading card game originating from Sumeru.
History
The game was invented by Garvipidam and Gulab as a means of spending time while the latter was afflicted with Eleazar. The game became popular in the hospital that Gulab was staying in, but he died before the card game could become famous outside of the hospital.King of InvokationsCulminate! Chatter of Joyous Dreams
Garvipidam became depressed after Gulab's death, and he never appeared in public since then and lived in seclusion.Commence! A Suspect Genesis He likely yielded the copyright to another group of researchers, who went on to flesh out the rules and even wanted to create a new version of the TCG.
It was an unspecified Sumeru researcher who commissioned Liben to bring the prototype TCG to Yae Publishing House in Inazuma.Liben Since then, the TCG has quickly spread through Inazuma and become popular all over Teyvat.Iris (Sumeru City) Puspa Café in Sumeru City is a common spot for players of the TCG to play.Nayab In Mondstadt City, players gravitated to The Cat's Tail tavern to play, so much that owner Margaret decided to have dedicated staff for catering to her new clients.

King of Invokations
Development
The book series 'King of Invokations' was written by the Inazuman author Fukumoto (King of Invokations) Fukumoto at the request of Sumeru Akademiya researchers in order to promote Genius Invokation TCG. Asagiri provided the illustrations for the series. Pose references were provided by the Traveler for the second book and Cyno for the third book.Next Time, On King of Invokations...
When he first began work on the book, the rules of the game had not been finalized, and since communication between Sumeru and Inazuma was slow, he struggled with the writing process. After he finished the first novel and published it through Yae Publishing House, it drove the sales of Genius Invokation TCG. The Akademiya researchers came up with a new version of the game, and Fukumoto was asked to write a sequel based on this. After attending a meeting with the researchers at the Akademiya, he stayed in Sumeru to work on the sequel and gather inspiration.
Even after finishing the first novel and learning the rules of the TCG, Fukumoto still struggled to find ways to make the novel more exciting, especially as it was centered around a card game. While working on the third novel in the series, Fukumoto became frustrated with the development process of the game and the behavior of the researchers; he came up with new mechanics entirely instead of writing about traditional TCG gameplay.
The bow Ibis Piercer was created to promote the final volume of 'King of Invokations', though the Yae Publishing House had only intended to order a sample bow, not a real weapon. Even though the weapon's existence was a mistake, Fukumoto was inspired by it, and added an excerpt to the book explaining the story behind the bow.Ibis Piercer
Story
King of Invokations (Book)
The premise of the story is that a young man from Sumeru named AbuKing of Invokations (Book) discovers an ancient Casket of Tomes in his attic. Inside, he finds the soul of the Crocodile King, the viceroy of King Deshret and a player of Genius Invokation TCG. The Crocodile King was sealed inside the Casket of Tomes by an opponent called the Ibis King due to his desire for war.
Abu is possessed by the Crocodile King, who transforms him into a legendary Genius Invokation TCG player. At some point, the Crocodile King stopped possessing Abu and got his own body.Ibis Piercer q=He heard the sound of the table being activated again in the "Room of Duels", and guessed that the young man whose his remnant soul had once possessed was eagerly waiting for a duel. King of Invokations #1 concludes with Abu defeating the Crocodile King in a duel with all of Abu's allies watching from afar. However, at the end of the duel when the Crocodile King was on the verge of death, Abu reflected on how boring the world would be without him, and made an uncharacteristic wish for a bloody war, allowing the Crocodile King to continue to live.
The protagonist of the game is said to use a slower deck that continuously accumulates resources, rather than a deck that quickly eliminates other characters. The opponent used Genius Invokation TCG Stage Kuroda Duel: Kuroda a powerful deck featuring Mirror Maiden (Character Card) Mirror Maiden, Mona (Character Card) Mona, and Bennett (Character Card) Bennett.
Due to a desire to make the story more exciting, various elements were included in the story which are not present in typical Genius Invokation TCG gameplay:
* In the second novel, the characters play cards while riding on horses.
* In the first two novels, the main character often wins only because he somehow gets a card that wasn't originally in his deck.
* In the third book, actual Genius Invokation TCG gameplay is not included; rather, the characters collect cards that are suspended in midair.</text>

<title>Raiden Gokaden</title>
<text>The Raiden Gokaden ja=雷電五箇伝 ja_tl=Five Traditions of Raiden were five bladesmithing schools in Inazuma's weaponsmithing scene, each specializing in their own unique forging art.
According to legend, the Raiden Gokaden developed from the blade-forging techniques taught by the Raiden Shogun, and the variations are "based on astrology, application, materials used, the furnace conditions, individual personalities, and elemental changes." Each art also developed their own techniques and secrets.Amenoma Tougo The families in the Raiden Gokaden eventually also became key members of the Yashiro Commission due to the cultural importance swordsmithing held in Inazuma.A New Painting in Pale Scarlet (Quest)
Presently, only the Amenoma Art still thrives while the Isshin Art has been mostly lost following the Case of the Eccentric, which saw Kaedehara Yoshinori put an end to the practice to protect his family from Scaramouche. The other three schools and their forging arts were completely destroyed as a result of Scaramouche's machinations.
The Five Schools
Amenoma Art
Amenoma Smithy
The Amenoma Art ja=天目伝 is the only surviving school in the Raiden Gokaden that continues training new apprentices. Its current master is Amenoma Tougo, with Hajime as his disciple.
Isshin Art
Isshin Art
The Isshin Art ja=一心伝 only barely survives in the present. In the past, it was host to three master swordsmiths, also known as the 'Isshin Sansaku': Kaedehara Kagemitsu, Niwa Nagamitsu, and Akame Mitsunaga.Haran Geppaku Futsu LoreIn the English localization of Haran Geppaku Futsu, the Isshin Sansaku are described as three works created by Kagemitsu, Nagamitsu, and Mitsunaga. While the phrase 'sansaku' ja=三作 literally translates to "three works," 'sansaku' is also used as a collective title for the real-life swordsmiths Kagemitsu, Nagamitsu, and Sanenaga, three master swordsmiths of the Bizen Osafune School. The Kaedehara Clan, Niwa Clan, and Akame School were the three main families who followed the Isshin Art's practice up until the Case of the Eccentric.
Futsu Art
Futsu School
The Futsu Art ja=経津伝 is a lost school. Its third-generation master, Futsu Minori, forged the Hasui Geppaku Futsu, while her foster son Futsu Masayoshi forged the Haran Geppaku Futsu. While Masayoshi was more skilled in swordsmithing than his sworn brother Futsu Hiroyoshi, Minori's son, Hiroyoshi eventually inherited the Futsu school while Masayoshi went on to mentor the swordsmiths who would later become the 'Isshin Sansaku'.
Hyakume Art
The Hyakume Art ja=百目伝 is a lost school. Little is known about them, although they are slightly more involved in the revised version of history after the removal of "Scaramouche" from Irminsul. In the revised version of the Case of the Eccentric, the unnamed head of the Hyakume Art carried out an indiscriminate slaughter of the Raiden Gokaden, not sparing even the other members of his own school.
Senju Art
The Senju Art ja=千手伝 is a lost school. No further information is known about them at the time.
History
According to legend, the Raiden Gokaden were developed when a ronin taught his five disciples the art of forging. Each art then developed their own techniques and secrets. The families in the Raiden Gokaden eventually also became key members of the Yashiro Commission due to the cultural importance swordsmithing held in Inazuma.
Tatarasuna Mystery
Tatarasuna Mystery
During the Tatarasuna Mystery, the Armory Officer in charge of the Mikage Furnace was Niwa Hisahide, who was the head of the Niwa Clan at the time. He befriended the kabukimono Katsuragi found in Shakkei Pavilion and treated him as his friend, with the two having been shown to have forged blades with each other. The then-head of the Akame Clan introduced a mechanic from Fontaine, Escher, to Niwa, as Escher had formed a technique that would revolutionize the forging process at the Mikage Furnace.
When the furnace started making workers deathly ill due to the black gas it was emitting, Niwa decided to go into the furnace and use Escher's purification device at the cost of his own life. After confirming his decision with Escher, Niwa confronted the mechanic over his suspicions that the furnace was sabotaged by Escher's own hand. Escher played coy until Niwa's back was turned and took the opportunity to fatally stab Niwa. He revealed himself as the Fatui Harbinger Il Dottore, that his actions had all been for an experiment, and lastly, that the purification device was designed for the kabukimono. Shortly after Niwa died, Dottore placed his still-warm heart into the purification device and gave it to the kabukimono so that he would purify the furnace in Niwa's place. After the purification was completed, the kabukimono asked Dottore, who was disguised as Escher, how he survived the ordeal in the furnace. Dottore pointed to the device, which he had previously claimed was entrusted by Niwa and the kabukimono opened it only to find a withered heart. Dottore wove a story that Niwa killed an innocent subordinate, placed it in the device, and fled Tatarasuna with his family. Feeling betrayed by Niwa's alleged cowardice, yet saved by it all the same, the kabukimono departed from Tatarasuna with a heavy heart.The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call
Dottore repeated his fabricated story to the other workers at Tatarasuna, leading people to believe his lies. When the authorities came to investigate the matter, Mikoshi Nagamasa - the Inspector at Tatarasuna and thus the next authority figure after Niwa - was going to have to take responsibility for the catastrophe with his own life. To prevent this from happening to his benefactor, Katsuragi took the blame onto himself and was executed by Nagamasa's hand.
After another incident which alienated him from humanity, the kabukimono left Inazuma entirely and wandered aimlessly. Over a hundred years later, Pierro sought him out and convinced him to join the Fatui. He joined Dottore's "grand research project," completely unaware that he had been Escher in disguise or that he was responsible for the tragedy at Tatarasuna.
Case of the Eccentric
In order to take revenge an unspecified "bladesmith," the kabukimono - having adopted the name "Kunikuzushi" - masterminded the fall of the Raiden Gokaden. By the time of Kaedehara Yoshinori's generation,Yoshinori is Kaedehara Kazuha's great-grandfather and was a young man by the time these events occurred. Assuming Kazuha is in his late teens to early twenties, and every generation spans roughly 20 to 40 years, the events that directly led to the Kaedehara Clan's collapse would have taken place around 60–120 years ago. the Futsu, Hyakume, and Senju schools had befallen strange mishaps and disappeared.Calabash of Awakening
When the Isshin Art was tasked with recreating a 'goshintou' with a diagram from the Raiden Shogun, their swordsmiths kept producing defective blades. Afraid of the punishment they would receive for failing to produce a successful blade by the due date, the swordsmiths fled, taking refuge with the Fatui and going on a self-imposed exile to Snezhnaya.Kagotsurube Isshin Suspecting that the diagram had been tampered with to sabotage them, Yoshinori and the Kamisato Clan head at the time attempted to pursue them. They were intercepted and singlehandedly defeated by Kunikuzushi, who was the one responsible for tampering with the diagram. After realizing Yoshinori was from the Niwa family and raised by the Kaedehara family after his father disappeared, Kunikuzushi left Yoshinori and the Kamisato head alive with a vague message: "Tell her this. My name is Kunikuzushi."The Palace, Dyed in Black (Quest) He then left, having lost interest in his project. This incident came to be known as the Case of the Eccentric.
Afraid of retaliation should they reveal the truth, Yoshinori and the Kamisato head agreed to cover up the events that had transpired. On account of his old age and the wounds he had sustained, the Kamisato head died shortly afterwards, leaving a vacancy in the clan and the commission. Furthermore, the failure to produce a successful blade or apprehend the fleeing swordsmiths was seen as a failing of the Yashiro Commission, which lost the Kamisato Clan its prestige and led to harassment by the Fatui. The matter was taken before the Raiden Shogun, but before she could pronounce her judgement on the issue, Yae Miko intervened on the Kamisato Clan's behalf. The Shogun spared the clan from punishment, and the Kamisatos thereafter swore to serve the Shogun eternally out of gratitude.
Legacy
The Amenoma Art is the only school among the Raiden Gokaden to continue its practice to this day, led by Amenoma Tougo. Kunikuzushi's attack on Yoshinori and the Kamisato head had lasting impacts on the Kaedehara and Kamisato Clans: Yoshinori ended the practice of the Isshin Art and his son, Kaedehara Kazuha's grandfather, never discovered the truth and was unable to revive the family business. By the time Kazuha came of age, the Kaedehara Clan lost its fortunes and properties. The Kamisato Clan failed to rebound from the repercussions of the event until Kamisato Ayato became the clan head.
Yoshinori wrote down the truth of what had occurred, but concealed it using ink that would only appear after coming into contact with water. The truth remained undiscovered up until Ayato, while investigating a Fatui spy who had searched through the confiscated Kaedehara Clan's possessions, came across the document and figured out the secret it held. Ayato then masterminded a plan to relay the truth he had uncovered to Kazuha over the course of the Irodori Festival, using a fabricated legend of The Five Kasen as a metaphor.The Five Colors' True Form
Revision
After Scaramouche learned the truth from the memories stored in Irminsul, feeling guilt that he had been deceived to, he decided to remove all traces of himself in Irminsul to restore the Raiden Gokaden and the lives that had been ruined. However, the changes made were very minor, as his removal simply prevented Dottore from using him and preventing his recruitment into the Fatui. Dottore still infiltrated the furnace and did not kill Niwa, although he and an unnamed blacksmith went inside and fixed the furnace at the cost of their own lives.
The unnamed blacksmith had a son who was left orphaned as a result of his father's death and was left embittered with the Shogun for her refusal to help. He passed on his hatred to his future generations, who all lived in misery. Roughly 300 years after the Tatarigami incident, the then-head of the clan snapped and decided to destroy the Raiden Gokaden, killing all blacksmiths in his path in an attempt to end the Raiden Gokaden. The then-head was successful in eliminating the Futsu, Hyakume, and Senju Arts, but was unsuccessful in eliminating the Amenoma and Isshin Arts, as he was stopped by the Kaedehara and Kamisato Clans, who killed him and put an end to the havoc.

<title>Remarkable Chest</title>
<text>Remarkable Chests are special chests found in Liyue's Chenyu Vale, Inazuma's Tsurumi Island, Sumeru, and Fontaine that give Furnishing Blueprints. Remarkable Chests outside of Tsurumi Island also give 5 Primogems each.
There are currently  blueprints available from Remarkable Chests. Though there is no achievement directly related to Remarkable Chests, the total number of Remarkable Chests found can be checked on the HoYoLAB app under "Battle Chronicle." The Remarkable Chests also count towards the achievement counts of their respective regions for opening chests.
Furnishing Blueprints
Learning these blueprints allows players to create furnishings using the Creation system. Most Remarkable Chests for these blueprints are unlocked by defeating the surrounding enemies; however, some chests spawn after completing open-world challenges or puzzles.
Tsurumi Island
Certain Remarkable Chests on Tsurumi Island only spawn by progressing through the Through the Mists.
Most Remarkable Chests are found in the world surrounded by enemies which must be defeated first. These chests are subject to the Tsurumi Island Three-Day Cycle Three-Day Cycle and will only appear on one of the three days; thus, it takes at least three days to collect all the chests. Some Remarkable Chests are spawned using the Peculiar Pinion, a gadget obtained on the second day of 'Through the Mists'.

<title>Kaedehara Yoshinori</title>
<text>Kaedehara Yoshinori is a historical character who appears in a flashback during the The Palace, Dyed in Black (Quest). He was Kaedehara Kazuha's great-grandfather and lived through the Case of the Eccentric around 100 years ago.
Profile
Born into the Niwa Clan, Yoshinori was adopted into the Kaedehara Clan, another clan in the Raiden Gokaden's Isshin Art. During the Case of the Eccentric, Scaramouche, who intended on destroying all the schools in the Raiden Gokaden, decided to spare him and his companions on account of his ancestry. Nonetheless, Yoshinori decided to close the family business to protect his family, cementing the decline of the Isshin Art.
Story
Kaedehara Yoshinori was born into the Niwa Clan. After his father's disappearance, he was adopted into the Kaedehara Clan, where he became the clan head and the leader of the Isshin Art. It was during his leadership that a certain incident later known as the Case of the EccentricKagotsurube Isshin came to pass.The Palace, Dyed in Black (Quest)
Case of the Eccentric
The Raiden Shogun ordered the Isshin Art to forge a Goshintou blade using a diagram she provided. However, all the swordsmiths - including Akame Kanenaga - created defective products and failed to deliver the product by the due date. Fearing punishment, the swordsmiths fled, taking refuge with the Fatui.Ere the End, a Glance Back Yoshinori and the head of the Yashiro Commission at the time investigated the matter and, suspecting the diagram itself had been tampered with, tracked the swordsmiths down to a beach near Byakko Plain.
There, they were intercepted by a mysterious youth - Scaramouche - who easily defeated them and their retinue. He threatened to destroy the Raiden Gokaden and only stopped after realizing that Yoshinori was from the Niwa Clan. After some deliberation, he decided to spare them, leaving behind a vague message: "Tell her this. My name is Kunikuzushi."
Aftermath and Later Life
After the incident, Yoshinori was instructed by the Yashiro head to cover up the truth of what happened to prevent the Kaedehara Clan from being accused of working with the perpetrator. They claimed that they had been defeated by the fleeing swordsmiths and failed to stop them from escaping Inazuma. For this, the reputations of the Kaedehara and Kamisato Clans suffered greatly, and the Kamisato Clan was spared from punishment only because of Yae Miko's intervention.
Afraid that their assailant would make good on his threat to destroy the Raiden Gokaden, Yoshinori decided to prioritize his family's safety and put an end to the family business, even if it resulted in the Isshin Art's decline. Yoshinori's son, Kaedehara Hisamichi, who was unaware of the truth behind the Case of the Eccentric, tried to revive the old family business but failed to produce the Goshintou, much like the swordsmiths before him had. Yoshinori's declaration that if he could not "find the secret within," the art deserved to fade away, enraged Hisamichi to the point that Hisamichi left Inazuma entirely. They never managed to reconcile before Yoshinori's death, which Hisamichi regretted.
After giving up swordsmithing, Yoshinori took up raising bonsai plants as a hobby. When he died, he left behind a will telling Hisamichi not to throw out one particular tree. At the bottom of the tree was a hidden compartment containing Kaedehara Yoshinori's Letter, which he wrote in his old age to document the truth behind the incident.
Legacy
Kamisato Ayato eventually discovered the letter and revealed its contents while investigating a certain Fatui spy's attempt to find such a document. Ayato waited for an opportunity to reveal the truth to Kazuha and finally found it in the Irodori Festival, where he used a fabricated legend of The Five Kasen to convey the truth to Kazuha, Kamisato Ayaka, the Traveler, and select companions that Ayato deemed trustworthy.The Five Colors' True Form
Although the Kaedehara Clan officially ended its bladesmithing practice after Yoshinori put an end to it, Kazuha still learned some of their techniques as well as the clan's combat style, which was developed to test their blades. During his first Story Quest, 'A Strange and Friendless Road', Kazuha encounters the sentient blade Kagotsurube Isshin, which was forged by Akame Kanenaga during his self-imposed exile to Snezhnaya to make amends for his betrayal of the Isshin Art.</text>

<title>Lynette/Lore</title>
<text>A magician's assistant hidden in the shadows who refers to herself as a "Multi-Function Magic Assistant." Poker-faced, reticent to speak, and as unpredictable in her movements as a cat.
Personality
A magic assistant of few words, her emotions are as inscrutable as any cat's.
Compared to her siblings Lyney and Freminet, Lynette is the most reserved of the three. She rarely talks to others out of her own accord, letting Lyney do the talking for her, and dissuades essentially any attempt to speak with her by saying bizarre responses. Whenever she needs to talk, she speaks briefly and frankly.
Due to a rare case of atavism, Lynette has feline features and traits, such as enjoying fish. She also has a habit of breaking and/or damaging machines, resulting her not using them frequently. Lynette enjoys making and drinking tea, though her sensitive tongue results in her having to cool it down first before drinking.
As a result of her traumatic past with Lyney, Lynette does not trust most people lest they take advantage of them, seeing her brother as a truth in a world full of lies and falsehoods. Like Lyney, she keeps her ties with the Fatui discreet.
Appearance
Phantomeow
Lynette uses the Medium Female Characters medium female model. She is a young woman with purple eyes, pale skin, and light grayish-brown hair tied into a low, thin ponytail which extends down her back. She has blunt bangs swept to her left, a short braid along the right side of her head, and two sections of hair which frame her face, curling inwards towards her chin. Additionally, she has cat-like ears, and a cat’s tail. She also has a small, dark brown star-shaped mark on her left cheek, mirroring her brother’s teardrop mark on his opposite cheek.
Official Introduction
Version 1
Lynette: The firmament glimpsed in a reflected moon
That's already the fifth time this month... Haven't you learned not to mess with Lynette?
In direct contrast to her older brother, who refers to himself as "the greatest magician in all Teyvat", Lynette might possibly be the lowest-profile Magician's Assistant in the land.
She seeks neither flowers nor applause, avoids interviews, and generally tries to avoid notice.
Whether people are trying to attract her attention or simply curious, she shuts them out with bizarre responses like "Entering Standby Mode" and "I need to space out."
Even when bigwigs from the audience pay them a private visit, Lynette always takes a back seat and lets Lyney do the talking. She prefers to brew a pot of tea and sit in the corner, looking down as she quietly sips away, apparently uninterested by the conversation.
Only the very few among them, in the briefest of interludes, sense for a millisecond that they are being secretly watched. But by the time they try to locate the source of the gaze, it has already vanished without a trace.
Yet the only other people in the room are Lyney – warm and hospitable as ever – and Lynette, whose undivided attention is being bestowed upon a teacup.
...Perhaps it was just their imagination.
...But even if not, what harm could a quick glance have done? It's not like they could have seen anything of any significance... could they?
Version 2
Lynette: The firmament glimpsed in a reflected moon
You needn't fret, nor should you feel like you have to change your own habits. But you should know that genuine understanding can only be found, not sought. A true companion is someone who can read your 'signals.
In their little team of three at the Hotel Bouffes d'ete, Lynette plays an essential role in making sure that their work runs smoothly. When Lyney's bold nature clashes with Freminet's cautiousness, instead of taking sides, Lynette stands back and analyzes the situation in a calm and collected manner. She resolves their disputes by helping them find a middle ground.
She's generally very quiet and is in the habit of constantly observing other members of her "family." If Lyney accidentally cut his finger in the middle of a performance, or Freminet suddenly looked downcast, Lynette would make a mental note of it. When she had a suitable opportunity, she'd be there with a bandage or a cup of tea.
She loves her "family" and her "family" love her. Waking up by the fireplace, she's become accustomed to the familiar sight of Lyney at the table practicing card tricks and Freminet cleaning the living room. It was in such a moment that she suddenly realized how long it had been since the memory of those sleepless nights of fearful anticipation had vanished — just like a lump of coal that had burned itself into oblivion.
Character Stories
When asked who the most famous magician in the Court of Fontaine is, audiences will almost certainly think of the stylish, vibrant Lyney and his stage presence.But if you were to ask after its most renowned magic assistant, people would scratch their hands and be at quite a loss to answer.The adulation is not for her, after all, nor is the resounding applause directed at her skill and presence. As an assistant, she needs only misdirect the audience at opportune moments, ensuring the spotlight stays on the protagonist.Whether on or offstage, Lynette habitually hides behind Lyney, in shadows that neither lights nor compliments can penetrate.For an assistant, keeping a low profile is a professional matter.And as for a child of the "House"... being cloaked in shadow is how one survives.
Lynette often uses phrases like "standby" and "power-saving" to avoid unwanted trouble.Now, if one were to use a term like "idling" to avoid work, one has an 80-90% chance of getting "doesn't that mean you're free, then!?" as a reply, followed by renewed haranguing.But, say, if you were to very seriously proclaim yourself to be in "standby mode" to "save energy," and combine that with a statue-like expression like Lynette's, you can stupefy the other party for a while.It is through such momentary gaps that Lynette will calmly slip away, all the while wearing a most serious expression.This method, of course, does not work on friends, but those who know Lynette well are more than aware of her dislike of work, and still more clear with regards to the... consequences of making her do errands.Though she might spout machine-related lingo often, that is about as far as Lynette understands machines.There is a saying in her home: No matter what you do, do not leave her unattended in a room with the dishwasher, the vacuum cleaner... or any machine, really.Failing this, by the time a third party (usually Freminet) arrives on the scene, the machine will have suffered one of two fates:One, it will have broken down, somehow - the dishwasher will foam at the mouth, the vacuum cleaner will suffer convulsions, all while Lynette stands amidst the disaster zone with an innocent expression.Two, the machines are mercifully spared, but there has been no progress with the task, with Lynette cat-napping in a corner somewhere.Considering that the result of any one incident is unpredictable, and neither result is desirable, Lynette has, to her relief, been relieved of all housework.It is strange, however, that she is able to wreck even the simplest machines due to mishandling...Yet, when onstage operating magical props, Lynette is even more focused than her brother, never having made a single mistake over the years.
From a certain point of view, a "magician's assistant" is a contradictory sort of work.The cheers and applause are for the magician, the protagonist, and similarly, the flowers and fame are not directed at the protagonist's sidekick.Yet a brilliant performance cannot exist without an assistant's cooperation.As the one closest to the magician onstage, the assistant knows all the magician's secrets, and in dangerous performances, the assistant's every move means life or death for the magician.Onstage, the magician and assistant are like a double-sided mirror. One tends toward the light, absorbing the audience's attention. The other faces the darkness, pulling levers and strings in the rear to complete the trick - each side turns the other in endless permutations.If they are to operate in harmony, the assistant's skills cannot be far behind those of the magician themselves.But with such skill, how could one long be content to live in another's shadow? Thus do many assistants, once their skills are fully developed, strike out on their own - they will not forever remain the pupil.When Lyney became famous, many notables took notice of Lynette's potential, believing that she could achieve greater stardom still should she become an independent act. Some even asked her to take up the role of a leading actress in their films.Cat ears on young lady, who was also a magician... Even with those gimmicks alone, there was a fortune to be made!Alas, these passionate entreaties fell on deaf ears, and not only would Lynette reject them... She could not even be bothered to come up with reasons for doing so, instead leaving the task of coming up with them to Lyney instead.This was quite the conundrum indeed, for many of those making requests were distinguished members of society. "Father" had left clear instructions - they were not to be treated with contempt.And if his authorship were to be discovered, any further meetings with them might turn awkward.So Lyney had no choice but to write letter after letter of refusal in Lynette's manner of speech, filling each to the margins with polite and earnest words.Even one as silver-tongued as Lyney found it exceeding difficult to mimic her laconic manner of speech.Exhausted in hand and spirit, glancing at his sister lounging on the sofa, Lyney could not help but think - why not try it for real? He could play the assistant, no problem."...Don't even think about it." Even that flicker of thought could not escape Lynette. She stretched, before flipping over to face him. "I like being your assistant."
Brewing tea is one of Lynette's few hobbies.Watching the steam swirl above the tea cup, getting a whiff of its elegant flavor, and the day's troubles all but melt away.Whenever a guest comes to visit, Lyney is usually the one who receives them, while Lynette waits with tea in the back. When words are had over tea at home, she is also usually the one who makes it while others do the talking.As others discuss all manner of things or engage in light and idle talk, Lynette can be found sitting at the side, holding her cup in two hands, blowing on it to cool it before drinking in small sips.Her tongue is naturally sensitive, and she cannot drink tea that is too hot.But to use merely warm water to make tea would be an abominable waste, and to add ice to tea, or pour the tea between two cups to cool it down... Lynette would consider such actions blasphemy.Ice dilutes the thickness of the drink, and the pouring will affect its layered flavor... Only by blowing on it, puff by small puff of air at a time, may one achieve the ideal temperature, so as to neither scald nor be shorn of flavor.And once this ideal temperature has been achieved, one should not also drink it all immediately.Some teas have greater flavor as you near the bottom of the cup, and a wait of several minutes should be imposed after one mouthful before one may continue on and savor the next sip. That is why she always takes her time when drinking tea.By the time the teapot is empty, the conversation is usually also just about over.And as for the teaware on the table... That might be best left to someone else, lest she wreck the dishwasher again.
There was once an official in Fontaine who wanted to investigate the cash flow of the Hotel Bouffes d'ete in the previous few months.However, no sooner had he finished drawing up a draft than his superior hastily called the whole business to a halt.This poor official could never have imagined how this was due to a letter his superior had received, complete with an attached set of photos featuring a tryst the latter had enjoyed with a famous socialite.This superior, too, could never have imagined that this secret had been exposed thanks to his whipping out a handkerchief that did not belong to his wife during a magic show.At that time, he had been all too absorbed in the exciting goings-on onstage, thus failing to notice the gaze directed his way from the shadows.This momentary distraction allowed Lynette to "steal" intel from him, all but picking him clean.People will unconsciously reveal themselves through their outfits, eyes, movements, and even the slight pauses and shifts in their tone...While most will be unable to get much out of such signs, buried as they are under many confusing details, Lynette is able to use her uncanny powers of observation to catch all such critical details.And after she connects all these seemingly trivial details, she can tease out intel useful to the Hotel.These "eyes" of the Hotel, one in the light and the other in darkness, have stolen all manner of secrets from the famous in Fontaine. Nor have any of these people noticed the theft - to them, it may as well have been magic.And because she must maintain this razor focus while working, Lynette speaks little to conserve her energy and not divide her attention.Even in her daily life, or when she is at rest, she habitually filters out all kinds of useless information...That said, what information counts as useful and what counts as useless is completely up to her.For example, what about machine operating and housework-related skills? Why, if one never does them, one can safely and confidently tuck them away in the back of one's mind.And when caught up in teatime gossip, one merely needs to occasionally append the conversation with "I see," "Is that so," and "And then..." to ensure a smooth-running chat.Economy of energy - just the way she prefers it.
People often believe that Lynette's cat ears are a part of her performance attire, as the same blood flows in her and Lyney's veins, yet he appears no different from ordinary people.However, Lynette's ears and tail do, in fact, grow on her body - they are real as real can be.It is said that these cat-like features are inherited, but that even as such a bloodline grows thin across generations, instances of "atavism" can still occur from time to time.When she was young, Lynette did not love this particular gift from her ancestors.There would always be some curious kid who would, whether intentionally or inadvertently, point at them and ask her: Why are you different from everyone else? Are you and Lyney not real siblings?The introverted Lynette did not know how to reply, nor could Lyney always be with her. Whenever such things would happen, she could only push her ears down, curl her tail up, and squat in a corner, by herself and beside herself with misery.Only alley cats would come to comfort her, coiling around and rubbing against her ankles.She could not let her brother see her like this, she knew. He already had a great many things to worry about - he did not need this kind of trivial matter on his mind as well.But she could not simply pretend that nothing was wrong - to deceive the genius magician, she had to fool herself first.So she hugged the cat tightly to herself, softly brushing the fur on its back. As she felt its light breath, calm slowly returned to her heart.By the time the cat leapt from her arms, her face had regained its usual placid appearance.Among Fontaine's nobility, there are also some novelty-seeking degenerates. During one party, a certain "important person" found themselves taken with Lynette's unusual appearance.Over her protests, despite her struggling, the siblings' foster father stuffed her into that person's carriage without a second thought, almost as if giving away a sofa-scratching cat.Why her? Why was she born with these ears?In her suffocating solitude, Lynette once again covered her ears in pain, unable to hold back the bitterness repressed over long years."Stop hiding. Cowering will get you nowhere." That voice shone through the darkness with the moonlight. "Come out. The one who wished to harm you is dead."That voice was cruel ice, and yet it had a spellbinding, comforting power also. Lynette lifted her eyes, and there she saw the person she would in later days call "Father.""You have good ears. Learn to use them.""Father" kneaded Lynette's ears. That touch was not gentle. Indeed, they were as cold as the moon's light.And like that light, it illuminated a corner of the darkness...."When a cat's ears are folded backward, that often indicates fear or vigilance, and if they stand up and point forward, that usually indicates a good mood..."Whenever Lyney tells new members of Hotel Bouffes d'ete about the habits of ordinary cats, he will often steal a glance at his younger sister nearby.Lynette's ears are straight, they face the front, and they occasionally flutter outward.It has been a long time since she last folded them back.
This is a made-to-order automated feeding machine that Freminet helped construct, intended to deal with the ever-increasing number of small animals at home.After a certain performance ended, Lynette discovered an abandoned box at the theater's back door.As she opened it, a few kittens, barely a month old, raised their heads in alarm. Yet they had not the strength to flee, and thus could only stare into her eyes anxiously.Lynette said nothing, nor did she reach out to further startle them. Instead, she simply looked back at them in silence.Slowly they seemed to come to the understanding that she meant them no harm, and eventually dipped their straining necks.Only then did Lynette pick the box of cats up, and they laid down in silence, allowing this young lady to take them back to their new "home."There was some small debate amongst family members as to whether the animals should be taken in, but the usually reticent Lynette put her foot down, insisting that they stay.The argument somehow managed to reach the ears of none other than "Father," and she had the final word - which was that her children should cease the silly squabbling."Those who wish to raise them, do so yourselves - but do it well. Don't make trouble for others."After a short silence, she then added, "And if you have not taught them how to follow the rules by the end of winter, get rid of them yourselves."That statement put paid to the rest of the argument. As for the task of teaching the cats, it fell to Lynette.Considering that Lynette was usually averse to busywork, Freminet had the automated feeding machine custom made.The machine came with an internal clock and a weighing machine that could allow it to feed the kittens various foods at precise times and in fixed amounts.This machine, in turn, became one of the few machines to survive Lynette's tender mercies, never breaking down across many years of service. Indeed, its inner components have remained spanking new, with only the plate beneath the food outlet showing much sign of use.And this... is because Lynette has never used it properly.The sort of food to add into each box, how to input feeding times and amounts... Rather than memorize that, she found it more convenient to personally prepare the cat food in a plate.Moreover, if she had to leave even feeding to a machine...Lynette squatted next to the Non-Automated Feeding Machine, stroking the satisfied cats' fur in silent thought....How would she be able to teach these children?
When Lynette was young, she often heard stories about Visions from Lyney.The protagonists of these tales seemed omnipotent, capable of summoning storms with a flick of a finger, dispelling dark haze with a puff of air.Those were not meticulously prepared magic tricks, no - this was the realm of true miracles.If only we had Visions too, Lynette often though.Then they could turn magic tricks into real magic. They could pull food to fill their stomachs from hats, and fire to keep themselves warm. Lyney wouldn't have to constantly busy himself keeping them both alive.But the gods never answered her prayers. In later days, she and Lyney would wander on, and after several twists and turns on the city streets and in noble mansions, they found a place to plant their feet under the aegis of their "Father."Both of them knew how hard this chance was to come by, and so they endured the harsh training and supported each other through countless missions.Reality had eroded their childish innocence all too early, and the dream of possessing a Vision, too, had fallen by the wayside of the past.During a certain mission, they were dispatched to perform at a noble's mountain villa in order to steal incriminating evidence that their target had hidden in a study.The mission itself was ordinary, and it went quite well. During their performance, the two would tamper with a window in the villa. Once it was over, they would be able to re-enter stealthily and make off with the evidence without a trace.But just as they had succeeded, three flares went up in the forest outside the window - a message from their "family members" keeping watch.Three flares meant the worst-case scenario: that the Maison Gardiennage was also targeting this person, and indeed had already dispatched forces to the scene.If they retreated the way they came, they had a high chance of encountering Maison personnel, and if they were exposed as having conducted their mission in their guise as magicians, not only would they be doomed, but their "family members" would be implicated as well.The voices outside the study were growing louder - if they wished to escape as quickly and stealthily as possible, they would have to take a risk.The villa retreat was built against the mountain, and out the window was a cliff, beneath which was a swift river.Lynette exchanged a glance with her brother, and without a word, they grasped each others' hands tightly, and leapt out the window.The rippling waves below slammed into Lyney with a terrible crash.He had attempted to absorb the impact with his shoulder just as they impacted, protecting his sister once again, but the impact with the water swallowed his consciousness.Desperate, Lynette grabbed onto a floating piece of wood, and by sheer dint of will managed to drag her unconscious brother to shore, coughing up water as she struggled on.Fighting the searing pain in her lungs, she checked his condition in a panic. He was deathly pale, his eyes squeezed shut - there was none of his usual vitality to be seen.She hugged him tightly to prevent his temperature from dropping further, even as she surveyed her surroundings. The forest was dark, and in that lightless night the twisted trees seemed ever more malevolent.She called his name softly, hoping that he might stand up again with a grin, just as he had in their prior performances. But this time, the only reply she received was his fragile and weak breathing.The loneliness and fear of that fateful night so many years ago seized her heart once again.It had been so long, and they'd been through so much - she'd grown from that, or so she thought.Why, then, were things just like before? Could she do nothing but wait for someone to defend her? As she trembled in the darkness?No. No. It should have been different. They had made so many miracles by their own hand, conquered so many obstacles....She had wished to stand behind him, supporting him, back to back, shoulder to shoulder.The Maison personnel could be patrolling nearby. She dared not call out to their "family members," nor could they stay here.The only thing she could do now was grasp Lyney's hand tightly, and haul him onto her shoulders.If she could not see the way forward, then she would hear it.Extending her ears as high as she could, she listened out for even the slightest wisp of wind.And the wind sang through the branches and through the bushes, and brushed against her face... and they gradually painted for her a blurry scene.Lynette groped forward in the dark, the thorns along the path piercing her skin and staining her clothes red.Slowly, the sight before her eyes became clearer. Perhaps her ears had grown used to the wind, or her eyes, accustomed to the darkness, but her steps grew more agile, more resolute.In this stage without spotlights, in this performance without plaudits, Lynette had at last become the star.As the rays of dawn darted into the woods, Lynette carried her brother back to the rendezvous point of their "family," only to encounter someone unexpected - their "Father" had personally made the trip down last night.Using the last of her strength, Lynette retrieved the sodden evidence from her bosom, but before she could hand it over, her legs gave out, taking Lyney down with her in the fall."Father" grabbed them both, allowing the incriminating information to fall to the earth and be soiled."Sleep now. You've retrieved... a far more valuable prize."A Vision, reflecting both the dawn sun and the twins' sleeping faces, hung at Lynette's waist, glowing silently.

<title>Durin</title>
<text>Durin was a shadow dragon created by the alchemist "Gold" Rhinedottir.Breeze Amidst the ForestThe Snowy Past Five hundred years ago, during the cataclysm, he invaded Mondstadt and was slain by the might of Dvalin.Skyward Blade His corpse fell over the mountain of Vindagnyr, thereafter leading the mountain to become known as Dragonspine.
Durin's blood was highly toxic and contained power from the Abyss. This blood was one of the catalysts that led to Dvalin's resurgence as "Stormterror" during the events of the Archon Quest 'Prologue'.
Profile
Durin had a gentle heart and dreamed of befriending the people of Mondstadt, hoping to share with them the stories of his creator and his birth. He was apparently unconscious of his destructive actions in Mondstadt and genuinely believed that his poisonous blood was a "great blessing," seeing the events of his rampage as a "very, very long dream" in which he sang and danced with Dvalin, Barbatos, and the people of Mondstadt. Even after he woke to find that he had been dealt a killing blow by Dvalin, Durin held no ill will toward Dvalin or Barbatos and only wished that they could have met under better circumstances.Festering DesireDragonspine Spear
Appearance
Durin is depicted as a disfigured, black skeletal dragon with glowing red eyes. His wings have long veins running along the folds. Judging from his skeletal remains around Dragonspine, Durin is almost as large as the great snowy mountain itself.
Story
History
Durin was created by Rhinedottir in the land of Khaenri'ah and classified under "Humus." Of her many creations, she considered Durin to be one of her "miraculous creations" alongside Albedo, who would not come into being until after the cataclysm. She had, however, started the Primordial Human Project to create synthetic humans before Durin's invasion of Teyvat; Primordial Albedo, her first attempt, was considered a failure and left inside Durin.The Shadows Deepen
Five hundred years ago, during the cataclysm, Durin emerged in Mondstadt and caused much devastation. The Knights of Favonius at the time had been preoccupied with a campaign in Khaenri'ah and suffered great casualties during the expedition; Wolf Pup Rostam perished in battle and Grand Master Arundolyn gave up fighting in his grief. This left no one capable of defending the nation from Durin's rampage. Hearing the pleas of his people, Barbatos awoke and summoned Dvalin to come to their aid.
Barbatos and Dvalin fought together against Durin, luring him over the perpetually-snowy mountain of Vindagnyr. Dvalin ultimately managed to land a decisive blow by piercing Durin's neck with his fangs, and Durin was sent plummeting to the area now known as Wyrmrest Valley.Version 1.2 Website:
Legacy
The mountain where Durin's corpse landed, previously known as Vindagnyr, thereafter became known as Dragonspine.Skyward Spine Durin's blood has soaked into Dragonspine's Ley Lines,Festering Dragon Marrow reviving the Frostbearing Tree which had been destroyed eons earlier by Celestia's Skyfrost Nail.Frostbearer Durin's heart is still "active" underneath Wyrmrest Valley, and his life energy has also spread throughout the valley.Wyrmrest Valley Consequences of this include the formation of Crimson Agate and Scarlet Quartz: the former is a result of Durin's life energy interacting with shards of the broken Frostbearing Tree,Crimson Agate while the latter seems to be a form of gemstone made from Durin's remains, containing his blood toxins.Enigmatic Page (V) Parts of Durin were used to forge the cursed sword Festering Desire.YouTube:
Dvalin, worn out from the battle and in pain from the poisoned blood he ingested, fell into a deep slumber in Decarabian's tower. He would eventually wake up to find a Mondstadt that had forgotten him, making him susceptible to the Abyss Order's lies that Barbatos had abandoned him. During the events of the Prologue Chapter, a reawakened Venti - Barbatos' vessel - would join forces with the Traveler, Jean, and Diluc to foil the Abyss Order's plot and restore Dvalin to his senses. Twice, Venti plays a tune explaining Dvalin's transformation into "Stormterror," during which Venti recounts the battle against Durin.That Green Fellow
Primordial Albedo eventually broke free from Durin's stomach. After he discovered the existence of a "successful" Albedo, he began conspiring to take the latter's place. To that end, he took on Albedo's appearance and used Durin's blood to create a Fellflower, a heavily mutated Cryo Whopperflower, having it take on the form of Albedo as well to serve as a distraction, although it was destroyed during the events of 'Shadows Amidst Snowstorms'.
The Fatui have secret plans for Durin's heart in Wyrmrest Valley, though the Traveler ends up interfering when they arrive.The Festering Fang</text>

Emanuel was raised alongside Basil Elton, Dwight Lasker and Karl Ingold at the Narzissenkreuz Institute. There, he often played games with them, taking on the role of the "hero" to fight against Karl, who played Jabberwock the evil dragon.
Emanuel joined the Marechaussee Phantom in adulthood and directed the Siege of Poisson, an incident which potentially led to the deaths of Rene de Petrichor and Jakob Ingold's parents.Enigmatic Page (II) The bloodshed left both a physical and mental mark on Emanuel, and prompted him to retire.
After retiring from the Marechaussee Phantom, Emanuel sank deep into alcoholism and disengaged himself from others. Anticipating a threat to the Narzissenkreuz Institute, Basil asked Emanuel to become the guardian of Alain and Mary-Ann before departing for battle. Emanuel reluctantly accepted her request and took the kids in, despite having no love for children and wishing to not associate himself with anyone. Although they never grew close, Emanuel became attached to the siblings over time.
Dwight Lasker, the director of the Institute of Natural Philosophy and Emanuel's childhood friend, received a report one day regarding the Narzissenkreuz Ordo and their leader, referred to as the "Master".Interactable: Institute of Natural Philosophy Ancient Investigative Report Ancient Investigative Report He entrusted the investigation of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo to Emanuel,Interactable: Institute of Natural Philosophy Ancient Notes Ancient Notes who undertook it to protect his son and daughter.Hunter's Brooch However, he would become the first person to be dissolved by the Master; the Champion Duelist Marfisa, who had been tracking Emanuel, became the second.

He regretted his inability to become a competent father figure for the siblings before being dissolved and assimilated by the Master.</text>

<title>Isshin Art</title>
<text>The Isshin Art was one of the five schools in the Raiden Gokaden, Inazuma's five most renowned bladesmithing practices. The Isshin Art had three main clans: the Kaedehara Clan, Niwa Clan, and Akame School.
The Isshin Art was one of only two schools to survive Scaramouche's attempt to destroy the Raiden Gokaden, alongside the Amenoma Art, albeit barely. Following an incident known as the Case of the Eccentric, the Isshin Art's influence was all but ruined, although the Kaedehara Clan still survives through Kaedehara Kazuha.
History
Isshin Art strives for complete harmony between blade and mind from the moment that forging begins. For only a blade thus forged can capture and convey its maker's thoughts and feelings, and eventually become an extension of its wielder's will.|Kaedehara Kazuha
According to legend, the Raiden Gokaden were developed when a ronin taught his five disciples the art of forging. These five disciples went on to form five different bladesmithing schools, each with its own techniques and secrets,Amenoma Tougo although it was not unheard of for members of one school to learn from another school.Haran Geppaku Futsu
Over 500 years ago, Futsu Masayoshi - more commonly known as "Masagomaru" - left the Futsu School to prevent a succession crisis between him and his sworn brother, Futsu Hiroyoshi. After traveling the world, Masayoshi returned to Inazuma and traveled to the other schools in the Raiden Gokaden to trade techniques. He took on three apprentices from the Isshin Art: Kaedehara Kagemitsu, Niwa Nagamitsu, and Akame Mitsunaga, who would go on to become the "Isshin Sansaku,"In the English localization of Haran Geppaku Futsu, the Isshin Sansaku are described as three works created by Kagemitsu, Nagamitsu, and Mitsunaga. While the phrase 'sansaku' ja=三作 literally translates to "three works," 'sansaku' is also used as a collective title for the real-life swordsmiths Kagemitsu, Nagamitsu, and Sanenaga, three master swordsmiths of the Bizen Osafune School.
Akame Mitsunaga's skills made the Akame School the leader of the Isshin Art. However, the school aimed to make the best blades for killing and its members often had some kind of "evil" within them. As a result, the school's leadership was revoked by the authorities only three generations after Mitsunaga,Kagotsurube Isshin and the Kaedehara Clan assumed leadership by Kaedehara Yoshinori's time. Kaedehara Yoshinori was born into the Niwa Clan but was adopted into the Kaedehara Clan after his father's disappearance.
Case of the Eccentric
As revenge against the "bladesmith," Scaramouche, going by the self-given name "Kunikuzushi," plotted to destroy the Raiden Gokaden. He masterminded the downfalls of the Futsu, Senju, and Hyakume schools before making his way to the Isshin. After sabotaging the Isshin swordsmiths' attempts to make an important Goshintou blade for the Raiden Shogun by tampering with the blueprint she had given them,The Palace, Dyed in Black (Quest) Scaramouche and the Fatui granted the swordsmiths - who feared punishment for their failure - refuge by taking them into self-imposed exile to Snezhnaya. Akame Kanenaga, the head of the Akame School, was among those who fled Inazuma.
While investigating the matter, Yoshinori and the Kamisato Clan head ran afoul of Scaramouche, who inflicted them with severe wounds. However, after realizing that Yoshinori was from the Niwa Clan, he decided to spare them and left them a message for "her." Scaramouche grew bored of the Raiden Gokaden after that and left the Amenoma Art untouched by his schemes.Calabash of Awakening
Aftermath
Fearing retribution from Scaramouche should they reveal the truth, Yoshinori and the Kamisato Clan head decided to cover up the incident by claiming they had faced resistance from the swordsmiths and failed to capture them. The Kamisato Clan head eventually died from his injuries, while Yoshinori decided to close the family business to protect his family. This decision met much resistance from his son, Kaedehara Hisamichi, but after he failed to produce a successful blade with the diagram - never catching Yoshinori's hint about the "secret hidden 'within'" - Yoshinori cemented his decision.
Although the Isshin Art officially ended its practice after this incident, Kazuha, Yoshinori's great-grandson, learned some of it nonetheless. With the Niwa Clan's presumed dissolution after Yoshinori's adoption into the Kaedehara Clan and the Akame School coming to an end with Kanenaga's death in Snezhnaya, Kazuha is the only known practitioner of the Isshin Art by present-day events.Ere the End, a Glance Back

<title>Food</title>
<text>Food are Consumable items in 'Genshin Impact'. It is the fourth tab in the Inventory. Food can be used to heal characters, revive characters, buff the player's character, or buff the entire party.
Most food items can be crafted through Cooking or Alchemy. A few (Apple, Bulle Fruit, Starshroom, and Sunsettia) can be foraged in the wild and consumed directly.
When knocked out characters are revived, they will still have the same ongoing duration of food buffs as the rest of the other party members. Food items cannot be deleted from the inventory, except for those aforementioned ones that can be foraged.
Food Quality
Cooking
Food items have 3 different types of quality: Suspicious, the regular version of the dish, and Delicious. Suspicious and Delicious variants of the dish have a 20% decrease/increase to the normal dish's stats respectively; the timer is consistent regardless of the food's quality.
Dishes, when cooked with a specific character, have a certain chance to be made as a Special Dish variant depending on the quality and quality of the food. These special dishes provide either a higher bonus or additional effect over its Delicious variant, as well as a separate icon, name and description.
Special Dish Probability of Making a Special Dish
Fullness
When a character consumes Recovery Dishes Recovery Dishes (Food that restores Attributes Health HP), their Fullness Gauge will increase. The Fullness Gauge has a maximum length of 100.NGA:
When Fullness = 100, no more Recovery Dishes can be consumed.
When Fullness > 0, it will deplete over time at a rate of 0.3/s
When Fullness reaches 100, the Full State will be applied to the character for 30 seconds, which halts the over time depletion of Fullness until it ends.
Fullness is reset to 0 when a character is revived.
Fullness increase from a single Recovery Dish item is calculated as \text{Parameter A} + \frac{\text{Parameter B}}{\text{Character Max HP}}.

Multiple Food Buffs
Eating foods with positive benefits other than health gain can increase stats like Defense, CRIT Rate, Attack - these are grouped into four types - Offensive, Defensive, Elemental, and Stamina. Only one food buff of each type can be active at a time, and the most recent one will replace any previously obtained, even if it is inferior. However, buffs affecting all four states can be active at the same time.
# Offensive group: CRIT Rate, CRIT DMG, Physical DMG, and Attack boosts
# Defensive group: Shield Strength, Defense, Health, and Healing Bonus boosts
# Stamina group: Climbing, Gliding, and Sprinting stamina reductions (stamina restoratives act separately)
# Elemental group: Both elemental damage boosts and elemental damage reductions are classed together, and it is not possible to have two boosts or a boost and resistance active simultaneously.
Notes
* Foods that affect Sheer Cold accumulation form the fifth group.
* When the player logs out, the duration of food/potion effects are frozen. It is not known if they will still tick when the game client is still running but not connected to the server.
* Flat Attack foods (like +100 Attack) are not modified by ATK% stats from equipment.
*Healing from multiple continuous healing foods does not stack.
* (As of Version 1.4) The numerical values currently active, nor their remaining time are not shown in any menu.
Cooldown
Some foods have a cooldown period after usage. Stamina refill foods have a 300-second cooldown, and Revival foods have a 120-second cooldown on usage. Unlike most other items with a cooldown on usage, the cooldown timer for food does not count down if gameplay is paused (i.e. opening the Inventory menu).
List of Food Items
Food is sorted into various types, indicated by an icon when seen in the backpack. Food items of the same type do not stack when used (any consumed food will simply overwrite any pre-existing in the same category, regardless of buff strength or star rank), and only four types of Food buffs can be active at once. Regenerative buffs do not fall under the three food buff categories, and the effects may exist alongside the other food buffs.
List of Special Dishes
Special Dish
Dishes that have a chance to be cooked if a specific character cooks them. Compared to the dishes they are based off on, they offer superior benefits (more HP/Stamina recovered, more potent buffs, longer duration etc.).

<title>Wildlife</title>
<text>Wildlife are a type of NPC that function similarly to Enemies encountered throughout Teyvat. Most Wildlife will be startled and flee when a player approaches them. While most wildlife is harmless, boars can indirectly damage players they unintentionally charge to. Sumeru introduced wildlife that will fight the player and cause them to enter combat mode upon being startled rather than fleeing, and they have health bars rather than simply dying in one hit.
Wildlife can be categorized into three sub-types by their interactability: uninteractable pets (cats and dogs), wildlife that drop items (birds and beasts), and wildlife that act as an interactable item pick-up (material sources). Creatures which function as interactables will not drop their loot upon death, but instead just disappear with a cloud of smoke. Fish are an exception, as they can be both killed to drop items and directly picked up.
Wildlife that drop items, besides fish, trigger weapon passives on hit, e.g., Sacrificial Series Composed, The Flute Chord. Artifact passives will not be triggered, e.g., Pale Flame's 4-Piece bonus, Tenacity of the Millelith's 4-Piece bonus. Some character talent passives will trigger, e.g., Sparkling Scatter. Some character talent passives will not trigger, e.g., Cold-Blooded Strike.
Most non-hostile wildlife, such as crabs and unagi, will only spawn when the player is relatively close to them.

<title>Spiritstone</title>
<text>The SpiritstoneWherefore Did the Spiritstone Descend? Spiritstone is a divine nail located in The Chasm: Underground Mines. A fragment known as the Wishstone was discovered in Stony Halls, and the effect it had on the miners who came in contact with it prompted the Liyue Qixing to close off The Chasm entirely. Chunks of ore that seem to be related to this mysterious large crystal were also found.Find The Chasm Mining Records
Overview
Little information is given about the Spiritstone or the ancient civilization whose ruins line the depths of The Chasm. Given that it is a divine nail, it can be presumed that it was cast down by the Primordial One after the war against the Second Who Came, both to heal the land and suppress the "dark poison" - suggested to be Abyssal power - that had penetrated the earth.Amethyst Crown
In the Wherefore Did the Spiritstone Descend?, the Traveler purifies the large crystal, which summon the Ruin Serpent Haftvad the Worm from the depths. Later into the fight, Yelan shoots the nail to drop it to the ground to destroy the creature, impacting the platform below and changing the nail's elevation.
During 'Perilous Trail', a group consisting of the Traveler, Paimon, Arataki Itto, Kuki Shinobu, Yanfei, and Yelan fall into the space underneath the Spiritstone. There, they discovered that the domain it was connected to had a mysterious property which completely annihilated the power of the Abyss, but also doomed the Millelith soldiers and the Yaksha Bosacius who had willingly sealed themselves in there to destroy the Abyssal threat during the cataclysm.

<title>Diona/Lore</title>
<text>The incredibly popular bartender of the Cat's Tail tavern, rising star of Mondstadt's wine industry, and the greatest challenger to its traditional powerhouses.A feisty feline young lady from Springvale, any drink mixed by Diona's hand tastes delicious beyond belief.Yet given her extreme distaste for alcohol, is her talent a blessing or a curse?
Personality
A young lady who has inherited trace amounts of non-human blood. She is the incredible popular bartender of the Cat's Tail tavern.
According to her father Draff, Diona is in a bit of a rebellious phase. While Diona adores her father and idolized him in her youth, witnessing his change in personality while drunk shattered the pedestal she put him on - and started her vendetta against alcohol. She despises just about anyone who indulges in alcohol, apart from Lisa and Eula.
Although Diona has the option of literally destroying the industry, she chose not to, instead opting to do so by plummeting the industry's reputation by becoming a bartender and serving terrible drinks. Unfortunately for her, her long-forgotten childhood friend, the Spring Fairy, blessed her with a magic touch that makes all of her drinks delicious, regardless of how noxious the ingredients used are, and she herself is unaware of this.
In her interactions, Diona proves to be a classic tsundere and is very naïve. She worries over the Traveler's ability to get home safely without night vision and offers to escort them home until they remind her that street lamps exist, after which she quickly denies ever having offered escorting them. She blames Diluc for her father's problems, even though the Dawn Winery had existed well before him or Crepus his father, and fails to see why the fans she and Barbara gets are drastically different. She also appears to have attachment issues and craves companionship, implied to be a result of Draff neglecting her when he's in his drunken stupors. She genuinely enjoys the company of those who have earned her trust, such as Klee and the Traveler, finding comfort in the Traveler's touch even begs them not to leave her and "become another dream". Although she displays many cat-like mannerisms, such as her love for fish, naps, hatred of vegetables and water, and tendency to meow, purr, and bite when angry, she hates being referred to as a cat in this regard. Also true to her feline nature, she is implied to be astraphobic, as well as aquaphobic.
Appearance
Sugary Brew
Diona uses the Short Female Characters short female model. She has fair skin, short pink hair, teal green eyes, and round eyebrows. Diona's cat ears and tail appear to be those of a calico cat.
Official Introduction
Diona:A glass of the Diona Special for you?
I've been bitten by a cat!
The incredibly popular bartender of the Cat's Tail tavern, rising star of Mondstadt's wine industry, and the greatest challenger to its traditional powerhouses...
Such is Diona's image in the eyes of her clientele.
Yet this feisty feline young lady from Springvale prefers to see herself as the "Wine Industry Slayer."
That ambition is reflected in her bartending philosophy: "I'm gonna ruin the taste of alcohol for everyone, for good!"
This subtle contradiction comes from a blessing - or, in Diona's mind, probably more of a curse - that has been placed upon her:
For any drink mixed by her hand is destined to taste delicious beyond belief.
Nevertheless, to this day, her deep distaste for alcohol prevents her from giving up her mission.
Devoted to concocting the most disgusting drink in the world that will single-handedly destroy Mondstadt's wine industry, Diona has been concentrating all of her efforts on this pursuit.
Character Stories
Whenever a guest walks into the Cat's Tail, they will immediately glance in the direction of the bar.Behind it often stands a girl with mildly-twitching cat ears, cocktail shaker in hand, and an unhappy look on her face.This is the mixologist Diona, ascendant star of Mondstadt's wine industry, and the greatest challenger to its traditional powerhouses.However, she does not make these wonderful cocktails on purpose - indeed, quite the opposite.Her mixing methods can seem a little "inscrutable" to an outsider. To herself, Diona tries nothing less than her hardest to ruin that hateful grog.But no matter the drink, it will turn out to be an unimaginably sumptuous brew so long as it passes through her hands.This is a "blessing" she has received, though that blessing is a huge headache for her.For this mixologist proclaims herself to be the "Wine Industry Slayer," and her final objective is the utter destruction of Mondstadt's entire wine industry.
Coming to the Cat's Tail to serve as its bartender was really a prank on Diona's part, the first step in her master plan.When patrons came in, they would "enjoy" her look of disgust as they got ready for the "Diona Special"..."Hmph. Here, drink this Sea-Salt Lizard, and kiss your life as an alcoholic goodbye..."So she would say, thus ruining these boozehounds' appetites.And yet..."*glug*... *glug*... Wow, I have never had such a wonderful drink! Can I get a refill, miss?""...You want a refill!?"To this day, Diona has struggled with her unbroken record of mixing fine drinks. Unable to accept defeat, she has yet to give up on her dream of producing something truly disgusting.However, the results are always the same, and the Cat's Tail remains a popular watering hole, with its pleased patrons singing praises unending of her skill.All poor Diona can do is puff up her cheeks, tears forming in her eyes as she grumbles:"Just you all wait!"
Diona's father, Draff, is the best hunter in Springvale.With a resolute face, honed hunting techniques, and calm judgment calls, he fully deserves to be the leader of the huntsmen of Springvale, and is an example to them all.In Diona's young mind, her father was her shining, perfect idol, the person she wanted to be.And that was also why she cried her heart out the day the pedestal she had put her father upon abruptly shattered."When he's drunk, he's like a wild boar rolling about in the mud!" So she said, her eyes ringed red.But Diona was not ready to blame this on her father's terrible drinking habits, for how could such a great father have such faults?"It's the wine's fault! It bewitches people and makes them stupid!"This is the source of Diona's hatred for alcohol, and the beginning of Cat's Tail's turn in fortunes.That said, Margaret, the owner of Cat's Tail, had never expected any of this to happen at all. Rather, she had a much simpler reason for hiring Diona."What choice did I have? She's just too cute."
Many patrons believed that Diona's feline ears and tail were part of her uniform as a bartender.This persisted until one day, when one particularly plastered fellow tugged her tail out of curiosity... only to find it unexpectedly warm and soft.That day, Diona turned the tavern upside-down.These feline features are the hallmarks of those with Kätzlein blood in their veins, and it is an exceedingly rare sight in Mondstadt.Other than such aesthetic similarities, Diona and her father Draff also owe their prowess on the hunt to this ancient bloodline.Infiltration, archery, climbing, and dodging... Diona required no teacher for such skills."Ah, yes, and she also has a pair of eyes that can see well in the dark.""As for weaknesses... She bites when piqued, so please be careful."Thus did Dr. Edith write of Diona in her notes for "Studies Into Bloodlines Strange and Unfamiliar."
Diona's appearance did indeed have an impact on Mondstadt's alcohol industry.The Dawn Winery's long-held monopoly was broken overnight by this unexpected ambush from Cat's Tail, and the man put in charge of the winery's business, Elzer, found this unacceptable.A calculating veteran of many industrial battles, Elzer considered poaching this key figure, never realizing that Diona considered the Dawn Winery a sort of "final boss" to be defeated in her quest."This marvelous and bold method of preparation must be the secret of these flavors, yes?"Diona simply looked at the white-haired man who had just sat down in front of the bar, rank displeasure in her eyes."Ah. Simply exquisite. I can just feel your incomparable passion and love for wine."Diona's hand started to tremble as it held on to her cocktail shaker, and detecting the change at once with his sharp gaze, Elzer understood immediately."If a brilliant bartender as yourself were to grace the Dawn Winery with your cooperation, we shall be able to bring Monsdtadt's alcohol industry to heretofore unseen heights!"...When Diluc questioned Elzer as to the story behind his bandaged hand later, he was uncharacteristically hesitant to say anything."I... I was bitten by a cat."
There is a legend about a "Callirhoe spring fairy" that circulates in Diona's hometown.The fairy once saved a mother and son who had despaired beside a well, filling the barren hole with rushing waters that pooled and formed a spring. The child, deathly ill, was miraculously healed by those spring waters.Many people came to catch a glimpse of these blessed waters, and built a settlement around it, and left it not thereafter. Over time, this gave rise to the small town known as Springvale.Nowadays, few are left who believe that this is any more than a mere legend, and some even dismiss it as myth-making for tourism's sake.Only little Diona believed in the existence of the spring fairy, and on nights when her father was in a deep stuporous sleep, she would speak to the moon reflected in the spring water's surface.These were her earnest feelings, innocent and wonderful - feelings worth answering.That was what the spring fairy believed.So, Diona would make a curious friend, a companion whom she could bare her feelings to and sometimes assuage her loneliness.On the night of Diona's seventh birthday, as the moonlight reflected off the spring and upon her face, she heard the soft voice of the spring fairy."I will bless you, daughter of hunters, for your days ahead, and as a farewell. May your cup always run over with the sweet wine of celebration. May it always be refreshing as springs of ever-melting snow."From that day on, the spring fairy would never appear before Diona again, and she left those memories behind, consigning them to her childhood dreams.Till today, she has yet to realize that her troublesome constitution has anything at all to do with that dream.
Diona's father Draff is also interested in mixing the occasional drink.Diona's tail would wag from side to side of its own accord as she watched her father rocking the shaker back at forth at night.But young Diona also found that her father would wind up particularly drunk on such nights, becoming dead to the world before he could even finish her bed-time story.Thus, when Draff went out to hunt one day, she hid the shaker, squirreling it away in the deepest place under her bed.Unexpectedly, her father didn't bother looking for the lost shaker at all. He simply brought a new one back the very next day.When Diona went to Cat's Tail to try out for the role of bartender, Margaret noticed how the cocktail shaker Diona had with her looked wholly unsuited for her style.Ever skilled with handicraft, Margaret would give Diona a cocktail shaker equipped with a lovely cat's tail as an induction gift."Now, this suits you far better," Margaret said with a satisfied nod.
Diona's antipathy towards alcohol is not "hate" per se. Instead, it can be considered a form of "avarice."She wishes for her father to always be the man that she admires, and she treasures every moment that she spends with her family, unwilling to "share" her happiness with the wine.There was once a storm that lasted for three days, and for those three days, her father, who had been out hunting, did not return.The awful weather prevented the search parties sent by the Knights of Favonius from making much headway, and soon the dread of "loss" began to hang over Diona like a shroud.If she could not even stand to "share," how could she bear having something utterly "stolen" from her?She burst out the door and into the tempest, and the waters that stood in her path were frozen by some power she did not recognize.Using her superlative tracking skills, she found her father under a broken gorge.With the help of the other hunters, she returned home with her father, and only once she realized that he would be fine did she finally smile again."Do you... want me to mix you a drink? It'll numb the pain a little..."That was probably the first time she ever mixed a drink in a normal fashion."Ooh, it's so refreshing. It's wonderful! Hahaha-Ouch..."Getting to drink a cocktail that his daughter had made was probably a better anesthetic by far than the alcohol itself.Still, Diona gaining power over Cryo did not help reconcile her to wine at all.

<title>Aggravation</title>
<text>the enemy threat mechanic the Elemental Reaction Catalyze
Aggravation, also known as aggro, is an enemy Hate (video games) threat mechanic. Aggravation in 'Genshin Impact' is a complex system with two major components: the  Detection Detection system which alerts enemies and causes wildlife to become startled, and the  Aggression Aggression system which determines the primary target of enemies while in combat.NGA: NGA:
Taunting refers to special character abilities that can aggravate enemies and change their target. All bosses are immune to taunt skills.
Combat Mode
When the player, a nearby ally, or a Taunt is detected by an enemy, the player enters combat mode. When the enemy is no longer aggravated, the player leaves combat mode.
There will be red arrows near the player that point to any enemies that are aggravated by a player or a nearby ally and are off-screen but not hidden or invisible. Enemies who are off-screen and who are also hidden or invisible will not have arrows pointing at them.
Upon alerting an enemy:
* Combat mode is initiated.
* Enemies who are aggravated will have an exclamation mark briefly appear above their heads.
*  A short drum roll plays.
* If there are no obstacles blocking the camera, then the camera zooms out all the way beyond the normal maximum zoom-out to the separate maximum zoom-out for combat.
While in combat mode:
* The player cannot change their party setup.
* The maximum zoom-out for combat mode remains during combat.
* The player cannot use most Gadgets, with the exceptions being some combat-specialized Gadgets like the Bokuso Box and the Lumenstone Adjuvant.
* In most of the open world, battle Soundtrack music will play. Stormterror's Lair and The Serpent's Bowels are notable exceptions.
* The player character's idle animations will not play when standing still.
Detection
Enemies and wildlife have an 'Awareness' meter that ranges from 0 to 100. The meter is updated every 0.016 seconds, also known as a 'Time Interval'.
Awareness increases when abnormal events occur that involve valid targets, such as players and taunt entities. When Awareness is above 0, enemies and wildlife become more sensitive and detect targets more easily. Abnormal events include:
* Spotting a target
* Hearing a target
* Sensing a target in close enough proximity
* Being hit by a target (immediately increases Awareness to 100)
When Awareness reaches 100, enemies enter combat and wildlife flee. Enemies whose Awareness reached 100 due to being hit by a target will start with a certain amount of Aggression toward that target.
Awareness increases at slightly different rates for each individual enemy and wildlife spawn. The slight differences are due to a 'Deviation Coefficient', which is a decimal between 0.75 and 1.25 and is picked randomly for each spawn.
When Awareness is below 100, it will decrease over time at a certain rate, but this rate is usually outpaced by the rate of accumulation caused by typical abnormal events. The Awareness decrease at every Time Interval is calculated as follows:
\text{New Awareness} = \text{Old Awareness} - \text{Awareness Decrease Coefficient} \times 0.016
Threat Level
When Awareness is 0, targets have a Threat Level of 0. Targets who cause Awareness to increase have a Threat Level of 1 until Awareness is 100. When Awareness is 100, targets have a Threat Level of 2.
Adjustments
Certain talents can directly modify the detection ranges of enemies and wildlife by an 'Adjustment Factor'. So far nothing modifies the hearing ranges of wildlife or any of the ranges of enemies.
Enemy States
Enemy states, such as whether hilichurls are asleep, relaxing, or alert, can affect their detection ranges.
Spotting a Target
Nearly all enemies and most wildlife can see targets, or 'detect targets by view'. Enemies and wildlife who detect targets by view can only do so in their 'Field of View', which differs per entity but is often 120 degrees horizontally and 60 degrees vertically. The 'View Range' of enemies and wildlife often 30 meters by default and will increase to 200 while in combat or fleeing.
Awareness increases when a target is detected by view and while the target remains in view. For some enemies and wildlife, the closer the target is, the faster Awareness accumulates.
Specific parameters for detecting targets by view include 'View Enabled', 'View Range', 'Horizontal FoV', 'Vertical FoV', 'Panoramic View', 'In-View Coefficient', and 'In-View Fall-Off Coefficient'.
If a character or Taunt is present within the enemy or wildlife's view, at every Time Interval:
\text{New Awareness} = \text{Old Awareness} + \text{In-View Coefficient} \times \text{Deviation Coefficient} \times 0.016 \times \text{In-View Fall-Off Coefficient}
Obstacles
* Objects taller than the active character (most noticeable in Stealth mode when crouching)
Not Obstacles
* Destroyable bushes and trees
Hearing a Target
Nearly all enemies and wildlife can hear targets, or 'detect targets by sound'. This is unrelated to the game's audio that players hear. Nearly all enemies and wildlife have a 'Hearing Range' of 20 meters from their location. Most sounds that can be heard by enemies and wildlife have a volume of 50 with no fall-off.
Certain wildlife have increased 'Hearing Sensitivity', which effectively increases the 'Volume' of sounds that they hear. All enemies and wildlife will also have 50% more sensitive hearing if a target with a Threat Level of 1 is within range.
When enemies and wildlife hear sounds, their Awareness is increased by the volume they hear, including additional volume due to higher sensitivity.
When Awareness reaches 100, an alarm that all nearby enemies and wildlife can hear will be sounded once with a volume of 100. The range in which the alarm can be heard from its location, or the 'Alarm Range', is 12 meters for all enemies and most wildlife, with the rest of wildlife only sounding alarms that can be heard by entities no more than 5 meters away.
Specific parameters for detecting targets by sound include 'Volume', 'Hearing Sensitivity', 'Hearing Range', and 'Alarm Range'.
When a sound occurs within the Hearing Range:
* If \text{Threat Level} = 0, \text{Incoming Volume} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Hearing Sensitivity}
* If \text{Threat Level} = 1, \text{Incoming Volume} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Hearing Sensitivity} \times 1.5
* Awareness is increased as follows: \text{New Awareness} = \text{Old Awareness} + \text{Incoming Volume}
Sounds
* Enemy alarms
* All Physical arrows upon landing
* The following characters' elemental arrows upon landing:
** Aloy, Amber, Collei, Sara in the Crowfeather Cover state from Tengu Stormcall (however, the Tengu Juurai: Ambush explosion from her Crowfeather seems to have negligible or no volume), Tartaglia, Tighnari, Yelan, Yoimiya
* Radishes from Raphanus Sky Cluster Yaoyao's Elemental Skill and Moonjade Descent Yaoyao's Elemental Burst
** These seem to make about the same amount of noise as the arrows that make noise.
* Stealth mode only: footsteps
Negligible or No Volume
* The following characters' elemental arrows upon landing:
** Diona, Fischl, Gorou, Sara when 'not' in the Crowfeather Cover state from Tengu Stormcall, Venti
* Hits on terrain from Catalyst characters, including those with projectile attacks
* Collection of resources and loot
* Hits from melee weapons, including the breaking of ores
* Enemy voices
* Enemy footsteps
* Enemy hits on player characters
* All non-combat player character movement and noises, such as sprinting, climbing, swimming, idle voice-overs, idle animations
Footsteps
'Detection by footsteps' is exclusively used by NPCs in certain Stealth quest objectives. Awareness accumulates while the active character is within hearing range, even if the character is not actually moving, and the rate is based on the character's distance from the NPC.
Specific parameters for detecting targets by footsteps include 'Footstep Hearing Range', 'Footstep Hearing Coefficient', and 'Footstep Hearing Fall-Off Coefficient'.
If a character is present within the Footstep Hearing Range, at every Time Interval:
\text{New Awareness} = \text{Old Awareness} + \text{Footstep Hearing Coefficient} \times \text{Deviation Coefficient} \times 0.016 \times \text{Footstep Hearing Fall-Off Coefficient}
Sensing a Target
Nearly all enemies and wildlife can sense very close targets, or 'detect targets by proximity', without having to see or hear them. Targets that can be sensed and increase Awareness include characters and taunts. The range in which a target is considered to be very close, or the 'Proximity Range', varies greatly across all enemies and wildlife. It is typically 8 meters for Common Enemies and wildlife and 15 meters for Elite Enemies.
When a target is within the proximity range, Awareness accumulates very rapidly and maxes out in about 0.2 seconds for most enemies, with a select few enemies taking up to about 1 second.
Specific parameters for detecting targets by proximity include 'Proximity Range' and 'Proximity Coefficient'.
If a character or Taunt is present within the Proximity Range, at every Time Interval:
\text{New Awareness} = \text{Old Awareness} + \text{Proximity Coefficient} \times \text{Deviation Coefficient} \times 0.016
Hit by a Target
Enemies and wildlife that are hit will find their attacker, or 'detect targets by hit'. Hits do not need to deal damage. Damageless applications of elements (Xingqiu's orbiting Rain Swords, Barbara's Melody Loop, etc.) or damageless instances of Interruption Resistance poise damage (Yoimiya's Niwabi Fire-Dance activation, Hu Tao's Guide to Afterlife activation, etc.) also count as hits, as wildlife may be startled and the Unusual Hilichurl can become aggravated when they receive such hits.
Some damage from separate sources, such as lightning, Aloy's Chillwater Bomblets, Kujou Sara's Tengu Stormcall Tengu Juurai: Ambush, etc. will not aggravate enemies under normal conditions. However, this behavior is observed to be inconsistent depending on the player's frame rate.
When enemies and wildlife are hit by a player attack, Awareness is immediately increased to 100, and Aggression toward the closest target within hearing range is increased by 20. (For the Unusual Hilichurl, which has no hearing range, the range is 20 meters.)
Specific parameters for detecting targets by hit include 'Sourceless Hit Range' (currently only used by the Unusual Hilichurl due to no hearing range) and 'On Hit Scan Range'.
Aggression
While in combat, enemies select their targets through 'Aggression', which ranges from 0 to 99,999 and is tracked by each enemy for each target. Each enemy will generally aim for the target with the highest Aggression. An enemy's Aggression towards a target increases by 20 each time that enemy is hit by the target or a summoned source of damage (also known as a summoned 'gadget') from the target. As a result, enemies generally target fast-hitting characters.
At every Time Interval, Maximum Aggression towards each target will decrease by 0.048% of the current Maximum Aggression.
Target Selection
The target with the highest Aggression is selected in the following cases:
* When no target is currently selected
* When the target with the highest Aggression has 20% more Aggression than the currently selected target
If an enemy has the same Aggression towards multiple targets, the first target to enter combat will be targeted.
Taunting
Every enemy has a 'Taunt Resistance' level, and every taunt has a 'Taunt Level'. When an enemy is within range of a taunt and does not have a higher Taunt Resistance level than the taunt's Taunt Level, the enemy is taunted, and their Aggression toward the taunt is increased by a set amount. Generally, taunting entities can taunt enemies up to 5-6 meters away horizontally and either 10 meters or infinitely far away vertically.
Currently, all Common Enemies and Elite Enemies can be taunted, and it is impossible to taunt bosses.
Specific parameters for taunting include 'Taunt Resistance', 'Taunt Level', 'Taunt Zone', 'Taunt Interval', and 'Taunt Value'.
Leaving Combat Mode
Generally, if players do not leave combat by defeating all aggravated enemies, then players can only leave combat after traveling far enough such that they are far from the aggravated enemies and their 'Defense Zones'. Players may also leave combat if all aggravated enemies also happen to only remain in combat as long as they can find a path to their target.
Specific parameters include 'Defense Zone Radius', 'Target Distance Limit', 'Border Distance Limit', 'Distance Clear Time', 'Path Loss Aggro Clear', 'Path Loss Clear Time', 'Out of Zone Aggro Clear', and 'Out of Zone Clear Time'.
Leaving Combat by Distance
If either Condition 1 or 2 is fulfilled, the 'Distance Clear Timer' will start.
* Condition 1: \text{Distance from Target} > \text{Target Distance Limit}
* Condition 2: \text{Distance from Target} > \text{Defense Zone Radius} + \text{Border Distance Limit}
If the Distance Clear Timer reaches its limit, Aggression and Awareness towards the target will be cleared.
If Conditions 1 and 2 become unfulfilled before Combat clears, the Distance Clear Timer will stop and be reset to 0.
Leaving Combat by Path Loss
Some enemies will not pursue their targets if they cannot find a path to their targets.
If Conditions 1 and 2 are not fulfilled, and both Conditions 3 and 4 are fulfilled, Aggression and Awareness towards the target will be cleared:
* Condition 3: \text{Time Since Last Attack} > \text{Path Loss Clear Time}
* Condition 4: \text{Time Since Path Loss} > \text{Path Loss Clear Time}
Clearing Combat by Defense Zone
When Out of Zone Aggro Clear is enabled, if Conditions 1 and 2 are not fulfilled, and Condition 5 is fulfilled, the Out of Zone Timer will start.
* Condition 5: \text{Target's Distance from Center of Defense Zone} > \text{Defense Zone Radius}
If the Out of Zone Timer reaches its limit, Aggression and Awareness towards the target will be cleared.
If Condition 5 becomes unfulfilled before Combat clears, the Out of Zone Timer will stop and be reset to 0.
Special Mechanics
In Phantasmal Gate challenges, players who stand near Dream Flowers that are neither Activated nor Scorched will not aggravate enemies and will de-aggravate any already aggravated enemies.
Other Observations
* Enemies may not become aggravated when they receive damage from Defense Mechanisms.
* Displacement from Vacuum Fields alone will not aggravate enemies.
* Most wildlife will be startled when nearby wildlife of any kind is collected or killed by the player.
** Exceptions to this include crabs, frogs and unagi.
Taunting Talents
The following character skills can taunt the enemy and change their aggro target.

<title>Rex Lapis</title>
<text>the Geo Archon the playable character Zhongli
Rex Lapis, also known by his Goetic name Morax, is the God of Contracts and a member of The Seven. He was the Geo Archon who presided over Liyue prior to revoking his providence during Chapter I.
Along with Barbatos, he is one of The Seven's two original members who are still alive at the start of the game. He currently wanders the world, disguised as Zhongli, a mortal man and a consultant of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.
He goes by a plethora of names and titles, including the Prime of Adepti, the God of Contracts, the God of Commerce, the Warrior God, and the Groundbreaker.
Prior to his retirement, Rex Lapis descended in his Exuvia zh=仙祖法蜕 form during the annual Rite of Descension to give guidance to his people for a prosperous year and dictate trade, which is the region's focus.
Profile
Introduction
The Mora currencies that flow through this land are my flesh and blood.For thus did I become the guarantor of the people's hard work, wisdom, and future.This is the trust I have placed in them. Betray it, and you taint my blood.|Morax
Rex Lapis is the God of Contracts, Commerce, and the Warrior God - among many other names. He was the Geo Archon and is the oldest of "The Seven," and possibly being one of the oldest, if not the oldest, gods at over six thousand years old. He is shrouded in a plethora of legends; both true and exaggerated, often depicting him as an all-conquering, powerful deity.
In addition to forming the geography of the Liyue region he governs, Rex Lapis defended Liyue in great battles such as the Archon War, which was waged in the area that is now Guili Plains against other gods. In one battle, he successfully defeated an ancient god known as Osial, using massive stone lances to imprison the sea god, which is now known as the Guyun Stone Forest. In another, he sealed the Mountain Dragon Azhdaha under a tree in Nantianmen following the dragon's rebellion. Other beings Rex Lapis has fought and slain include the Chi that lived in Qingce Village and the god that was Xiao's former master.
Morax is also the source and namesake of Teyvat's currency, Mora. Morax's Gnosis was used to mint Mora at the Golden House before he retired from his position as Archon and ceded his Gnosis to the Tsaritsa.
Currently, Rex Lapis resides in Liyue Harbor as Zhongli and works as a consultant at the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.
Appearance
During formal events such as the Rite of Descension, Rex Lapis takes the form of a half-Chinese dragon dragon, half-Qilin lin creature.Rite of Descension note=chinese localization However, based on other depictions of him, he typically takes a human-like form.
Statues of The Seven in Liyue depict him as an adult man wearing a hood and robes wrapped around his legs, holding a cube. In , his back is shown, donning a white robe with a hood and wearing long, wide pants. His hands are depicted orange, with vein-like markings traveling up his arm. He has long, dark brown hair tied back into a long ponytail, with the rest being style in  wind-swept fashion. His hair fades into a bright amber at the ends of his rattail.
The 'Rex Incognito' series claims he changes forms frequently depending on the situation (having appeared in the form of different men and women throughout history) but always has bright amber eyes in any form he takes. This is assumedly the trait that follows him throughout all of his forms, however Zhongli hints that Rex Lapis has a "true appearance."Web Event: Stone Harbor Treasure Journal Story Stone Harbor Treasure Journal
Story
History
How he came to be is currently unknown, however he descended to Teyvat more than 6000 years ago.Solitary Fragrance After he descended, he lowered the tides and raised Mt. Tianheng.Stone Tablet Compilations: Vol. I
Before the Archon War, Morax was already known as the Lord of Geo. He was close with Guizhong, the God of Dust, and they formed a settlement for their people in Guili Plains, which was named after them.Treasure Lost, Treasure Found (Part 1) He was also on good terms with Guoba Marchosius and Madame Ping. However, after the Archon War broke out, Guizhong perished in a battle that laid waste to Guili Plains and Dihua Marsh. Afterwards, Morax moved their people south of Mt. Tianheng, to the place that is now Liyue Harbor.
To protect his new city, Morax formed a contract with the adepti to defend the harbor as he continued waging war against his many enemies. Baqiu,Primordial Jade Winged-Spear Lore Chi, Osial, and Xiao's former master were defeated by his hand, while Havria, too gentle for this brutal period, was slain by her own people. The survivors of Sal Terrae were spread throughout Liyue, many of them coming to Liyue Harbor. At some point, he befriended a Azhdaha massive dragon and gave it sight, who became a lifelong friend, but the dragon eventually deteriorated from "erosion" and he was forced to seal his old friend away underneath Nantianmen.The Unforged Lore
After defeating the other gods, he sealed them underground, where their physical bodies decomposed and became one with the earth. Their souls, however, were immortal; their desire for revenge and lust for life seeped into the earth, resulting in miasmas, plagues, monster attacks, and other such calamities. To quell these disturbances, Morax summoned the Yakshas to aid him in battle, endlessly subduing the ancient gods.Yakshas: The Guardian AdeptiStory Teaser:
As the Archon War came to a close 2,000 years ago, Morax emerged as one of the seven victors. The Seven would dine together in Liyue. Morax also met Makoto Baal's 'kagemusha', Ei Beelzebul, during one of these meetings. Two millennia later, only Morax and Barbatos remained as the original Archons amongst The Seven. The other five died and were eventually replaced.
Morax's level of involvement in the cataclysm 500 years ago is currently unknown, but he is aware of how greatly it affected the Tsaritsa.Downtown An unknown party later made a contract with him in which he would not disclose the truth of the incident to anyone who might ask.Amidst Chaos, the Rock Is Unmoved
In the more recent past, a xiezhi adeptus that had campaigned with Morax for many years approached the archon to discuss his plans to marry a mortal woman beforehand. Morax was not only fine with it, but also contributed to the couple's wedding gift. The couple would later have a daughter, Yanfei.A Teapot to Call Home: Part I The xiezhi would eventually gift his daughter with a steelyard balance, said to be a treasure once given to him by Morax himself and could be used to measure the value of all things.
Present Day
Zhongli/Lore Chapter I
In the Rite of Descension, Rex Lapis is purportedly assassinated during the titular Rite, and his vessel - known as the Exuvia - was taken away to the Golden House by the Liyue Qixing.
In the A New Star Approaches, it turns out that he took on the form of Zhongli and instigated most of the events of the chapter with the aid of the Tsaritsa and her envoy, Signora. This was designed to be a test to see if Liyue was ready to move on without his protection, as he intended to retire from his position as the Geo Archon. Having not to have to use his Gnosis to personally intervene had things gone wrong, he handed it over for delivery to the Tsaritsa as part of his contract with her, which he called "the contract to end all contracts."
At some point prior to the Rite of Parting - but after handing his Gnosis over - Morax used an ancient adepti art to inform the Liyue Qixing through Ningguang that he was still alive, but had chosen to step down as the Geo Archon, thus dissuading suspicion placed upon the Traveler for his "murder," and to later confirm this to his fellow adepti (although Madame Ping realized this beforehand).The Realm Within, A Single Harmony for an Irreplaceable Soul He left the matter of the official explanation of his death up to the Qixing.The Fond Farewell

<title>Lisa/Lore</title>
<text>She is an intellectual witch who can never get enough naps. As the Librarian of the Knights of Favonius, Lisa is smart in that she always knows exactly what to do with whatever troubles her.As much as she loves her sleep, she still manages to keep everything under control in a calm, composed manner.
Personality
The languid but knowledgeable Librarian of the Knights of Favonius, deemed by Sumeru Akademiya to be their most distinguished graduate in the past two centuries.
Lisa is a proficient witch; as such, she enjoys everything related to the elements and items that would help her understand them. Despite her position as Librarian, Lisa takes it somewhat haphazardly as she appears to be relatively bored dealing with normal books, instead preferring those in the restricted section. She still takes the job seriously nonetheless, and will personally go out to collect books that are long overdue, albeit in a way that she can still enjoy the smaller things in life.
Her haphazard, carefree personality comes from her time in Sumeru Akademiya, as while studying there she noticed the types of effects the pursuit of knowledge can have on a person. She studied in the Spantamad school for two years and left Sumeru shortly after graduating, relegating herself to categorization and management of the library and usually refusing to take any other duties unless absolutely necessary. Despite repeated pleas from Gafoor to return to the Akademiya, Lisa refuses to give up her life in Mondstadt.
When Lisa is angered, the surrounding air near her becomes electrified in part due to her Electro Vision. Depending on the severity of what has angered her, she can either be simply irritated or become extremely scary, the latter also causing her to dispense "appropriate" punishment.
Lisa seems to be fond of the Traveler, and sometimes acts flirtatious, referring to them as "cutie" or "darling," and admitting that they're special to her.Lisa
She loves tea and thinks that afternoon tea is the most important part of her day. She sometimes takes tea with vegetable soup as she once used to enjoy this with Jean at the Good Hunter restaurant. She also suffers from cucurbitophobia, a fear of pumpkins.
Appearance

If you put enough flour into Hydro Slimes, would they turn into Dough Slimes?
The Librarian · Lisa
"There'll be time for this later... Come sit and chat with me."
Lisa, Librarian of the Knights of Favonius, has great wisdom that is unparalleled throughout the city. She always knows what to do with whatever troubles Mondstadt.
But with so many careless readers and overdue books to deal with, Lisa often gets tired and a bit... drowsy. Never disturb her when she's taking her morning, midday, or evening naps. Otherwise you will come to understand why she is an outstanding knight - in an electrifying way...
Character Stories
The librarian of the Knights of Favonius. In addition to her elegance and charm, Lisa is also highly educated.She is said to have been the most talented sorceress to study at the Sumeru Akademiya in the last two centuries.It is known that Lisa chose to return to Mondstadt after two years of advanced study in Sumeru, but the reason for her decision is not. At present, Lisa's job is to oversee the book collection in the library owned by the Knights.
Lisa is tasked with managing and maintaining the vast collection of books in the Knights of Favonius library, as well as ensuring that their potions are always fully stocked.The only time that the citizens of Mondstadt see Lisa is when lending or returning library books.In both scenarios, they tend to encounter Lisa sitting at the counter like a languid cat, yawning as she signs books in and out.At times, her behavior causes people to doubt whether she is really up to the task of being librarian for the illustrious Knights of Favonius.Nevertheless, it appears that she performs every task flawlessly, as her work consistently stands up to scrutiny.
The fact that Cyrus (Sumeru) Cyrus of the Sumeru Akademiya frequently refers to Lisa as their "best student in two hundred years" is all that needs to be said about Lisa's accomplishments in her studies.From outlandish forbidden knowledge, to the handling of elementally infused flora, to the most efficient methods of distilling wine... where there is a body of knowledge, the chances are that Lisa is acquainted with it.This, paired with her ability to explain things clearly and concisely, makes Lisa the sensible person to approach for young knights and alchemists with burning questions.That is, provided they go and see her at an acceptable hour.To visit during unacceptable hours - such as in the morning while Lisa is sleeping in, or in the afternoon while she's enjoying her tea - can spell disaster for unsuspecting visitors.
When people meet Lisa for the first time, they often find themselves overawed by the famous alumna of the Sumeru Akademiya.However, though her attitude to life may appear at first to be one of ruthless efficiency, it is in fact better understood as a product of her incorrigibly lazy nature, which drives her to avoid troublesome issues at all costs.By negotiating with Kaeya, she offloaded the job of restocking and dispensing medication to Huffman and Swan, and had Flora start sending Donna over to deliver herbs on a daily basis.The only tasks that Lisa handles personally are the categorization and management of books and other documents.This is the one area where Lisa feels more comfortable handling the work herself rather than delegating it.
When Lisa first joined the Knights of Favonius, the Varka Grand Master sought to appoint her as Captain of the 8th Company.This was much to the consternation of the company's Field Officer, Nymph, who resented the idea of an academic coming in at such a high-ranking position.At Kaeya's suggestion, a practice combat session was arranged in which Lisa and Nymph would both display their magical proficiency.Two minutes into the session, Lisa graciously declined the captaincy on the grounds that "Nymph manifestly possesses the requisite ability to fulfill the role."For the whole year following, the Grand Master received a constant stream of referral letters from Nymph in relation to the captaincy, and the only person ever named in them was Lisa Minci.Eventually, the Grand Master began turning over the referral letters to Lisa directly, but every time, Lisa would come up with an excuse to decline the offer.Undoubtedly, the 8th Company would have been far stronger under her lead, but she deemed that such a level of power was not only superfluous to requirements, it would also be risky for her in a way that most people could never appreciate.To be clear, Lisa is quite confident that she could handle any situation she came up against. However, additional danger means an additional workload - and that is something that she would never be able to accept.
Having personally witnessed raving-mad scholars in the forests of Sumeru and powerful sages sitting underutilized on advisory councils, Lisa realized what uninhibited erudition can really do to a person.It seemed such a high price to pay... How much did one have to sacrifice to attain the profoundest knowledge of all?Put off by this realization, Lisa decided to leave Sumeru.Since then, Lisa has always stopped short of taking things too seriously."Before demanding too many miracles from the gods, first consider if you are willing to pay the price they ask."These words she has spoken to just three people since arriving in Mondstadt. In each case, it was because she knew it was what they needed to hear.
The Special Heating Cauldron is a purpose-built cauldron made to a design that no one in Mondstadt could understand. It features time-delay heating, semi-automated ingredient insertion, and temperature regulation functions.Lisa spent an enormous budget and commandeered the alchemy workshop for two full weeks in order to build this extraordinary piece of equipment.She boasts that the cauldron is capable of completing any precision heating task to perfection with a maximum of just two pulls of a lever.But her most common application for it is to brew tea and keep it at the optimal temperature while she is managing her books.After all, a relaxing afternoon tea session is by far the most important part of Lisa's day.
A Vision is a sign from the gods: a sign that you are one of those whom they have chosen to change the world.Or, maybe it's just one of the many hoops that one has to jump through on the path to unearthing the secrets of magecraft.After all, understanding the elements is essential to the study of magic, and practical experience is a far more useful means of acquiring this understanding than trying to assimilate the knowledge contained in dusty old books."Hmm... I suppose I shall need a Vision, then."And just like that, as that thought popped into her mind, her Vision popped into her hand.With the aid of her Vision, Lisa acquired the knowledge that she sought. But she also sensed the deep secret hidden in the shadows of that knowledge.For whatever reason, the gods gave humans the key to changing everything, but they did not explain the cost involved. Lisa grew fearful of the truth.The Vision that hung from her neck became to her a bottomless pit filled with sweet delights, lingering at the back of her mind.So, from time to time, when somebody whom she finds interesting comes along, Lisa will pass onto them her understanding on all kinds of matters.Perhaps she is secretly hoping that by doing so, one day someone will come along who has the ability to understand the ultimate truth behind Visions.

The Special Security and Surveillance Patrol is a special department in the Maison Gardiennage, currently led by Chevreuse. They are responsible for solving violent crimes and apprehending said criminals. Unlike the other divisions, their members are not subject to standards from the other divisions; they do not use standardized weaponry or wear a uniform outside of formal events. They also do not mind recruiting the descendants of criminals whose households were stripped of honor, as long as they are capable of proving they can enforce justice. Most of their members use muskets, though they are also skilled in unarmed combat per Chevreuse's standards. An unwritten rule of the Special Patrol is that should a member fall in the line of duty, the others would hold onto their cap; should their children ever join the Special Patrol, they would pass the cap down to them.

<title>Crepus</title>
<text>Crepus Ragnvindr, known as Master Crepus to some, is the deceased biological father of Diluc and adoptive father of Kaeya. Prior to his death, he was the head of the Dawn Winery. He and Diluc are descendants of the Dawn Knight Ragnvindr.
His untimely death, which occurred around three years prior to the game's events, caused the falling out between Diluc and the Knights of Favonius. The infamous Fatui are connected to the cause of his death.
He made his first appearance in Chapter 7: Dusty Chest in the official Manga.
Profile
I wanted to become a Knight too, when I was your age. However, I wasn't fit for the job. The gods also had other plans for me...
When Crepus was young, he dreamed of joining the Knights of Favonius but did not qualify to become a member. Despite not being able to achieve this dream, as his son Diluc believed, he contributed to Mondstadt as much as the Knights have but in his own way. Crepus wished that his son would become the most esteemed knight. This pushed Diluc to train rigorously and then passed the Knights of Favonius' trials. He would soon rise to the position of Cavalry Captain, becoming the youngest with that title in the Knights' history.
Crepus was a talented winemaker and greatly respected by those in his employ, such as Connor and Elzer who mourned his death while still in the prime of life.ConnorElzer Elzer also regarded him as a father figure and went on to manage the winery whenever Diluc was away.
As a father, Crepus loved his sons greatly. When Kaeya was abandoned at the winery around a decade ago, Crepus took him in and treated him as his son; because of this, Kaeya felt torn between Mondstadt and his homeland Khaenri'ah.
Appearance
Being biological family, Crepus bears a resemblance to Diluc, and both have long red hair. He also had a short, square-like red beard. In his only appearance in the manga, Crepus wore a black coat, black gloves, a white chef-like coat, and red tie.
Story
At Angel's Share, Crepus holds a celebration with patrons for his son's coming of age. He and Diluc leave the tavern after the party to return home before rain would come. On the road, a horrific monster, Ursa the Drake, attacks the transport fleet they were traveling with. Many lay dead on the ground and as the monster is about to attack again, Crepus uses his Delusion to protect his son and defeat Ursa. The power he wielded was so great that Crepus was mortally wounded. Shortly after, he succumbed to the effects of the Delusion and passed away in Diluc's arms.In the manga, the Delusion's power caused Crepus' body to disintegrate. However, Kaeya's accounts in both the manga and his character stories state Diluc killed Crepus to spare him the suffering. The Knights of Favonius led by Kaeya witness this, having arrived too late to help them.
Diluc returns to the Knights' headquarters with a heavy heart. There, he receives an order from Eroch Inspector Eroch: "Conceal the truth." Eroch insists that in order to maintain the reputation of the Knights of Favonius, the incident must be covered up as an unfortunate accident. He explains that the people of Mondstadt will not trust the Knights to protect them anymore if they were to know a "mere businessman" was the one who settled the incident. Enraged, Diluc resigns on the spot and takes off his Vision. Amber, hiding in the room, hears everything.
Diluc later departs from Mondstadt, embarking on a journey across Teyvat to uncover the origins of the mysterious power that killed his father.

<title>Cage-Shaped Geo Formation</title>
<text>Cage-Shaped Geo Formations are found near the Bedrock Keys set up by the Liyue Qixing to prevent entry into The Chasm: Underground Mines The Chasm. They are activated with Geograna during 'Surreptitious Seven-Star Seal Sundering'. Once activated, it can be hit to fire a crystal projectile in the direction of the hit.
The first and last Bedrock Keys that the player destroys each have two nearby Cage-Shaped Geo Formations, while the rest have three nearby. Each Cage-Shaped Geo Formation has a Geo-colored wisp of light leading to it from its associated Bedrock Key.
All Cage-Shaped Geo Formations can only be interacted with during certain parts of 'Surreptitious Seven-Star Seal Sundering'. Those that cannot be activated yet look crumbled.
Tutorial
Cage-Shaped Geo Formations?
Crystal Projectiles
If the crystal projectile is fired in the direction of the associated Bedrock Key at the right elevation, the crystal projectile will hit the Bedrock Key and bring it down, and the Cage-Shaped Geo Formation will disappear. It is recommended to go from top to bottom for efficiency, as firing a crystal projectile at the wrong elevation does not do anything.
Not all hits will fire off a crystal projectile. Generally, most melee attacks will work, but projectile attacks and attacks by summoned objects will not. In addition, there is a 1s cooldown before another crystal projectile can be fired.
The crystal projectile can hit players and enemies, applying 2 Elemental Gauge Theory gauge units of Geo but no damage of its own. Due to the application of Geo, the crystal projectile can also Crystallize. Additionally, this hit is considered a Blunt Attack and can Shatter.
In Co-Op Mode, all players can bring Geograna to the Cage-Shaped Geo Formations, but only the host's hits can fire off crystal projectiles.</text>

<title>Sangonomiya Kokomi/Lore</title>
<text>Kokomi is the Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island, and also serves as its supreme leader.She is well-versed in the art of war, is good at strategizing, and has keen insights into military affairs. She is also adept at handling domestic affairs, diplomacy, and other matters.
Still, this unfathomable leader has a mysterious side to her...
Personality
The Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island. All of the island's affairs are at this young lady's fingertips.
As the Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island, Kokomi handles almost all of the affairs on the island herself. While she is not content with such a burden, having preferred to be a military advisor, she nonetheless takes the mantle to give her people the hope and happiness they deserve. Like Jean, Kokomi easily burns herself out completing her tasks and tries to keep it hidden from others to avoid worrying them.
Along with handling all sorts of affairs, Kokomi is a skilled strategist that thinks of all potential scenarios and how to handle them as a result of reading plenty of military books, although she also enjoys casual reading. Kujou Sara remarks that her planning prevented the Tenryou Commission from claiming full victory over the Watatsumi Army. She continues this habit even outside of military affairs. As a result of the role she plays, she is universally beloved by her people.
Appearance
Sparkling Coralbone
Kokomi uses the Medium Female Characters medium female model. She has long, pale salmon pink hair and light indigo eyes with no pupil and a large white highlight at the top of her iris.
Official Introduction
Sangonomiya Kokomi:Victory Through Wisdom
Her Excellency, Sangonomiya, is an astute strategist. She can accurately predict enemy movements from thousands of miles of way. When we fought against the Shogun's army, what we lacked in manpower and weaponry, we more than made up for with Her Excellency's tactical prowess. Were it not for Her Excellency, not a single one of Watatsumi Island's victories would have been possible.
The Divine Priestess and supreme leader of Watatsumi Islandsic
Many believe Sangonomiya Kokomi to be an enigmatic, shrewd leader. However, she always has a quiet smile on her face, and while she gets things done in an orderly fashion, she will sometimes do so over laughter and light conversation.
Having read many military treatises from all over Teyvat since she was a child, Kokomi has a talent for strategy and is capable of outwitting opponents through clever stratagems. Although Watatsumi Island lacks manpower and materiel, its people have managed to turn the tide of battle many times thanks to Kokomi's tactical prowess. Whether in battle, trade, diplomacy, or internal affairs, Kokomi will do her best. Her achievements have won her the respect of Watatsumi Island's various factions.
"Never fear, Her Excellency Sangonomiya is here," has become a popular saying amongst the people of Watatsumi Island.
However, few people know that Kokomi's biggest aspiration has always been to merely be an adviser behind the scenes. Socializing with others is in fact a most tiring task for her. Her hands shake every time she gives a speech, and she entertains thoughts of retreating into herself every time work starts piling up. She enjoys herself most while holed up at home after finishing her work, face buried in her military strategy books.
To reach a lofty post at such a young age is considered a great achievement, but for Kokomi, the higher up one is on the mountain, the more treacherous the path.
Version 2.1 Preview Introduction
The Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island.
All of the island's affairs are at this young lady's fingertips.
The desire to protect Watatsumi Island lives on in the bloodline of the Sangonomiya Clan. The current heir to this bloodline is known as the Divine Priestess. The meaning behind this is as such: to inherit the will of a Orobashi god in a mortal's body, and to defend this land and its people in that god's stead.
Character Stories
The inhabitants of Watatsumi Island once lived in Enkanomiya, at the bottom of the sea.It was only by the grace of the god Orobaxi bringing them up to the surface that the civilization of Watatsumi Island exists today.When Orobaxi was slain by the Electro Archon, its body was left as a skeleton and its resentment permeated the land, giving rise to Tatarigami.Yet its desire to protect Watatsumi Island never faded. This will lives on in the bloodline of the Sangonomiya Clan, and follows them from generation to generation.The current heir to this bloodline is known as the Divine Priestess.The meaning behind this is as such: to inherit the will of a god in a mortal's body, and to defend this land and its people in that god's stead.
The day Kokomi ascended to the role of Divine Priestess, countless inhabitants of Watatsumi Island came to Sangonomiya Shrine of their own accord to see her.Surprise, suspicion, confusion, chuckles... Their expressions were strange, all on account of her overly-young appearance in their eyes.Plots were hatched and questions were endless. The ambitious planned to make their move. The storm was approaching, and all was not at peace on Watatsumi Island.Yet all went back to business as usual not long after Kokomi ascended to her position.She was fair in distributing rewards and punishments alike, appreciated the contributions of the people, and was militarily skilled. Her many abilities quickly won the hearts of most of the people."Things will be alright as long as Her Excellency is here" soon became the most widespread saying on the island.
There are many factors involved in deciding victory or defeat.Terrain, weather, differences in military strength and equipment quality... All of these require careful consideration.Those who study the details too closely tend to miss changes on the field, and most who speak of strategy speak of it in a vacuum.Only those who can grasp both the big picture and the small details can create miracles on the battlefield.And behind all this lies countless hours of hard work delving into the reasons behind one's failures.Few if any ever persevere to the end, but Kokomi was not only good at this but also possessed a unique tactical style."Manipulate the larger strategic situation to force the other side to give up, and to win wars with the least amount of cost possible."
Whether on the battlefield or off it, Kokomi tries to "know thy enemy" as much as possible.She tends to predict all possible scenarios beforehand and devise strategies to address them, which are then delivered as directives to those who enforce her will.This has given rise to the issue of some of these directives being rather thick and heavy, but this method has guaranteed the stable development of Watatsumi Island.Today, Watatsumi Island moves each day towards greater prosperity, and as more talented people have been appointed to office, the directives that Kokomi has to deliver have decreased.As far as she is concerned, that is something worth celebrating.
When Kokomi has the time to spare, she will go on walks on Watatsumi Island alone.She often tries to avoid crowds, pacing slowly through the violet forests, sometimes sitting by the seaside and looking out into the distance.The sun and the moon rise over the sea, the stars shine in their skies, and the sound of the waves is pleasing to the ear, relaxing the soul.Sometimes she will even place a seashell on her head, only to put it back where she found it when she leaves.In her mind, perhaps some wandering crab will burrow its way inside and call this shell home.Sometimes, Kokomi will also go diving, enjoying the calm atmosphere by herself, her worries sinking into the ocean depths as schools of fish swim all around her.Kokomi treasures every sight there is to be seen on Watatsumi Island, and she remembers the name of every person.Sadly, while scenery remains, people's hearts are complex and changeable.Victory is simple enough to attain compared to the mammoth task of making sure that everyone lives happily.This dilemma has always troubled her.
Kokomi has been well-read since she was young, and has a particular love for military treatises.As such, Kokomi has a broad store of knowledge to be used in every field.But another result of her constantly being buried in such treatises of war and illustrated military texts is that Kokomi lacks skill in social interaction. She does not know when it started, but interacting with people eventually became tiresome to her.Having ascended to the role of Divine Priestess, Kokomi had no choice but to learn many things that she wasn't any good at before, whether it was dealing with people or performing duties that she had little interest in.However, forcing herself to do things she holds little love for is a serious drain on her energy reserves, leaving her feeling quite exhausted.As such, Kokomi set up an "energy" system of measurement for herself. When she does things she enjoys, her energy levels will increase, and the reverse is true when she trudges through unenjoyable slogs.When she runs out of this energy, Kokomi will temporarily put her duties as the Divine Priestess aside and resume being an ordinary homebody.Engrossing herself in the close reading of a book on military strategy, walling herself off from the rest of the world - thus does Kokomi reclaim a temporary respite from her busy existence.These moments are of utmost value to her.
"As the ruler is, so shall the people be."This precept was something Kokomi heard from her mother a long time ago.The Divine Priestess' role is one of utmost importance to Watatsumi Island, and its people's eyes are always upon her every move.The things she loves will be in fashion, and the things she dislikes, the people will also distance themselves from.Kokomi, in truth, has no wish to affect the people's lives, and as such has rarely ever revealed much of her personal likes or dislikes.She treats all things with an egalitarian manner, and holds "fairness of judgment" and "justice in dispensing rewards and punishment" to be her guiding principles.However, these are not necessarily her true feelings, and so she prepared a book of secret notes for herself.Here, she records the fluctuations in both her energy levels and mood.When the night deepens and the world falls silent, Kokomi will open this book and write the day's experiences, whether they be joyous, sad, or frustrating....Of course, this object is for her eyes only - and so it must remain.
A leader with a strong will can lead those around them in a clear direction.However, Kokomi lacks such strong ideals. Instead, she respects the will of the people and wishes that they can each find their own way.Just as the vast ocean can accommodate countless souls and their individual desires, so does Kokomi wish her rule could be.When the Vision Hunt Decree came about, the resentment of the people turned into cries of revolt, and so Kokomi led them in raising the banner of resistance.And once the war was over, the hearts of the people turned towards peace and stability, and so did Kokomi direct her energies towards governance and economics.But what was the source of this toil? Was this the role of the Divine Priestess speaking? Or was this a product of her own sense of duty? Or perhaps... it was a bit of both?As the Divine Priestess, Kokomi naturally has her own Vision. And ever since the day she looked out at the sea outside Sangonomiya Shrine, her wish has never once changed-"I wish to protect all of Watatsumi Island and allow its people to lead happy lives."

<title>Yoichi</title>
<text>Yoichi ja=与一 ja_rm=Yoichi is a tengu who lives in Toki Alley in Hanamizaka.
Story
Within the book Toki Alley Tales, the tale of Yoichi is recorded by a tanuki. Yoichi is a rambunctious Tengu who often forgets to compose herself while in the company of humans. She often gets drunk off of poor quality alcohol, and makes scenes such as walking onto a stage mid-performance and fighting the lead actor. Because of her senior status among the youkai and her extensive connections among humans she doesn't face punishment for any of her chaotic deeds.
During a drunken night, Yoichi regales the tanuki with stories of her battles in other worlds. In one world, she had served under a shogun in the form of a male archer. He was fierce in battle with his bow, taking down many fierce opponents. In his most renowned battle the tengu had between straits. The sea turned red from all the blood shed. Eventually, the rival sent out a small boat with one lone figure and a flagpole with a golden paper fan. Yoichi in his drunken rage at the obvious provocation, shot an arrow at the golden fan. The shogun shouted while the army cheered. Using the cheering as a distraction the tengu flew to the boat and snatched the golden fan and the woman. He then pushed over the loud-mouthed shogun before being scratched to pieces by the woman who turned out to be a bakeneko. Yoichi then brought the neko to the world they now resided in.
The bakeneko, Osen, tels a very different version of the story. Osen had been sent by her own shogun into a boat where she transformed into a young woman. She claims that Yoichi was so drunk that when he shot many times in an attempt to shoot the golden fan, he missed every shot. To save him embarrassment she swiftly took down the golden fan. He then spread his wings and soared into the air toward Osen and fell into the sea. Osen dragged Yoichi out of the sea and flew away laughing. Because of her uncontrollable laughing, Osen had scratched Yoichi. After this Yoichi brought Osen to their current world.Toki Alley TalesToki Alley Tales</text>

<title>Zumurud</title>
<text>Zumurud, also known as the Verdant Lord, was a historical figure in the Great Red Sand, Sumeru, who lived thousands of years ago and ruled over several city-states that existed in the desert.
Story
Zumurud was the son of Muzaffar, one of the Twenty-Nine Deys of Orghana (the city now known as Port Ormos) and then conqueror of the Great Red Sand cities. Zumurud was raised "in the forest" and did not speak the desert language.Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, Primal Obelisk Duat Hall Duat Hall
His father instructed him to "leave as many heirs as a pomegranate tree bears fruits", and so Zumurud had 99 children, 50 sons and 49 daughters. Inscriptions in the Great Red Sand seem to contradict each other on Zumurud's descendants; one inscription claims Badanah (and thus also his brother Muzzudin) was one of Zumurud's fifty sons (assuming the line is meant to be read literally),Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, Primal Obelisk Valley of Dahri Valley of Dahri while another claims that "[Badanah's] father is most beloved of the Verdant Lord," which indicates that Badanah was not Zumurud's direct descendant.  Nevertheless, according to the inscriptions, "children of the Verdant Lord walked the land like gods, and the Verdant Lord's realm was as indestructible as the Mausoleum of King Deshret."
In the second year of his reign, the Verdant Lord had a dream which he made "the greatest scholars" write down in the Desert Language, including on one Primal Obelisk.
Zumurud saw the following in a dream last night.He dreamed that in the darkness, the sun arose from his... swallowing the light of the stars and the moon.The sun shone over the land that was filled with yellow sand, and not even the slightest trace of a bird could be found there.The Verdant Lord sighed at the sight of this vision, determining that... should become like the forest, a paradise of green. As he breathed, out of the desert... vast, clear springs, and a boundless... trees that touched the very skies.He saw a thousand ships, ten thousand roses, a hundred... caravans without number, woven into gold across the desert...Just as... about to put on those golden robes, he awoke to see an arrow of sunlight piercing the summit of a mountain.</text>

<title>Blazing Heat</title>
<text>Blazing Heat is a temperature effect that appears in very hot areas. Currently, this is only present in Narukami Island: Tenshukaku during the fight with Signora in her second phase.
Currently, it is only known that the blazing heat effect can be halted or reversed when standing near Eyes of Frost or destroying it in Narukami Island: Tenshukaku during the fight with Signora in her second phase.
Overview
Similar to Stamina, Blazing Heat is shared between characters for each player.
When Blazing Heat begins to accumulate, a sound effect plays and a gauge appears over the active character's HP bar. When the gauge is 70% full, it begins to beep every 2 seconds and pulse with a red glow. In addition, the edges of the screen become fiery, reducing the player's peripheral vision. When the gauge is full, the gauge takes on a steady red glow, the beeping stops, the edges of the screen burn over more to further reduce the player's peripheral vision, and the player begins to  HP Loss lose HP.
The Blazing Heat gauge depletes quickly over time when leaving the Trounce Domain Narukami Island: Tenshukaku.
Accumulation Rate
Conditions !! Accumulation Modifier
Affected by Cryo or Hydro || -20%
Affected by Pyro || +20%
HP Loss
When the Blazing Heat gauge is full, the active character will lose HP at a rate of 3% Max HP + 150 HP per second. If not mitigated, then the active character will die to Blazing Heat in roughly one minute, give or take as much as half a minute depending on how much HP a character has.
HP loss from Blazing Heat is unaffected by the conditions that increase and decrease the Blazing Heat accumulation rate if the Blazing Heat gauge remains full. HP loss only stops once the Blazing Heat gauge is no longer full.
Some max HP thresholds and how long it takes for all HP to be depleted by Blazing Heat:
* 22 seconds — 10,000 HP
* 27 seconds — 22,500 HP

<title>The Knave</title>
<text>the current Knave the previous Knave The Knave (Previous)
The Knave, also known as Arlecchino, is the Fourth of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers.
She makes her first appearance during '' alongside her fellow Harbingers.
She is the current director of the House of the Hearth, and is addressed as "Father" by members of the house, whom she calls her "children."
Profile
Rosalyne died in a foreign land... But you heartless businessmen and dignitaries, always with a convenient excuse to remain in the comfort of your homeland... You couldn't hope to understand. So why don't you keep your mouths shut! We don't want to make the children cry...|Arlecchino
Little is known about Arlecchino beyond her role in running the House of the Hearth. She is known as "Father" by its members, unlike The Knave (Previous) the previous Arlecchino.
Appearance
Arlecchino uses the tall female model, and has a slim build with a pale complexion. Her eyes are black with red “X”-shaped pupils.  She has two layers of hair; the first is short, grey, and slightly teased, with a lock on the right side which extends to the shoulders, and bangs that reach her eyebrows.  Above her bangs she wears a root of black hair, while her second layer is longer than the rest and is combed in a downward ponytail with a red-accented black ribbon.
Arlecchino's outfit consists of a straight corset-type shirt in gray with a blue/black tone, a short white tie that in the middle has the symbol of the Fatui in red and black, pronounced shoulders, sleeves with red-edged black ruffles on the wrists, and pants which are tight at the waist but flare out just above the ankles. The skin of her hands and forearms is apparently black, with long fingernails painted red, and she wears several rings.  She wears stiletto-heeled with a gray tone and reddish details, and white “+” shaped earrings. Her Pyro vision is attached to the back of her jacket at the nape of her neck.
Story
Several years ago, Arlecchino, who had grown up in the House of the Hearth, clashed with the previous holder of the Knave title and ended up succeeding her.Momoyo She reworked the House of the Hearth; while strict, she insisted that the House be collectively maintained, allowed its members to complete tasks their own way and did not punish them as severely as her predecessor. This caused Efim Snezhevich, an instructor at the House of the Hearth who was loyal to the previous Arlecchino, to act independently to pursue the previous Arlecchino's directives, successfully using Arlecchino's name as leverage.The Replacement's Secret
After taking over from her predecessor, her relaxed policies allowed Freminet to spend more time looking for his mother, who he had not heard from since he was given away to the old Arlecchino. However, he was unsuccessful in doing so and was on the verge of giving up when Arlecchino threw him a pendant, which was his mother's. She had taken care of a group of "scum" and only realized after she had given him the pendant that he was unsure of what happened to his mother. Learning what the previous director had told him, she became enraged at her manipulation and told Freminet the truth about why his mother had left him. After stating that the pendant was what she was able to find, she left with silence, making him realize that his mother was killed by the loaners for not giving him up to them.
When Lyney and Lynette were adopted by a noble who tried to traffic Lynette away to another noble, Arlecchino was somehow aware of the incident and slew the recipient, discovering her with other female orphans held captive. Lyney, who also learned where his sister was being held, ran into Arlecchino, who proceeded to offer the twins a spot in the House of the Hearth. While Lyney was initially hesitant to accept at first because of what had happened, Arlecchino also slew the noble who had taken them in, prompting him to accept her offer. Arlecchino would task the two with various missions across Fontaine, one of which involved obtaining incriminating evidence from a target which was jeopardized by the presence of the Maison Gardiennage. During the escape, Lyney was rendered unconscious, forcing Lynette to escape with him in tow. When she arrived in the rendezvous point, she was met by Arlecchino; while the evidence was ruined, she noticed her Anemo Vision, which she deemed more valuable.
Arlecchino began tasking Lynette with more dangerous missions, and Lyney would eventually ask Arlecchino for a Delusion in an attempt to stay with his sister. Arlecchino refused his request and appeared to be angered at the thought, and told him that he already had what he needed to support his sister. Lyney's resolve to protect his family after a mission that nearly resulted in them falling to their deaths resulted in him gaining a Pyro Vision. Arlecchino would also eventually deem Lyney her successor to the House of the Hearth.
Being a native of Fontaine, Arlecchino believed in the prophecy that the people of Fontaine would dissolve into water and ordered the House of the Hearth to find a way to stop it from happening. While still upholding the Tsaritsa's will in collecting the Gnoses, Arlecchino asked her for permission to use the Gnosis before giving it to her, which she accepted.Lies Cast Shadows Under Gathered Lights
Following Tartaglia Childe's disappearance from the Fortress of Meropide, Arlecchino decided to investigate Furina and Neuvillette, while sending Lyney, Lynette and Freminet to the prison to gather information. During her own investigation, she suspected that neither were the Hydro Archon, especially the former due to her behavior and a "curse" of some sort and concluded that the Hydro Gnosis was hidden away. She would eventually meet with the Traveler during her second meeting with Furina, where she expressed anger over the Archon's apparent lack of urgency regarding the prophecy to protect her people. Without Neuvillette around however, she decided that such topics would not yield much and concluded the meeting, where she privately gave her thoughts about her Archon to the Traveler. She also thanked them for helping her "children" and would be willing to help them regarding the prophecy if needed.
Arlecchino was later notified of some ancient ruins near Poisson which interested her and she sent an expedition group to explore it. On the way, they discovered that the Primordial Sea had risen in the town, so they abandoned that prospect to help the people out and thus had the Traveler explore it on her behalf. Later on, she would have the Fatui assist Lyney and Freminet with their tasks to have Furina stand trial. After the prophecy ended, Neuvillette gave her the Hydro Gnosis as a "diplomatic gift", which she accepted. Before she left for Snezhnaya, she caught up to her "children" at Romaritime Harbor and thanked the Traveler for their assistance. They also gave her Childe's Vision which she would return to him.Masquerade of the Guilty
It is unknown whether the other known Fatui dealings involving members of the House of the Hearth are related to her or the previous Arlecchino.

<title>Azhdaha</title>
<text>the character the Weekly Boss Azhdaha (Weekly Boss)
Azhdaha is an ancient Earth Dragon and the Overlord of the Geovishaps mentioned in Liyue legends.In Azhdaha's design notes and the Chinese version of 'Amidst Chaos, the Rock Is Unmoved', Azhdaha is called an Earth Dragon zh=地龙 rather than a Geo Dragon, which would be 岩龙, although he is still affiliated with the Geo element.
Though he was once an ally of the Geo Archon Morax, erosion and conflict with humanity led him to be sealed away in The Chasm (Subregion) The Chasm and under the Dragon-Queller in Nantianmen.Hidden in Nameless TreasuresTrails in Tianqiu Since then, he has sought to break free of his imprisonment, absorb the energy of all the ley lines of the world, and destroy everything.Primo GeovishapJiu
Description
An enormous dragon as ancient as the mountains themselves. In an age that has all but faded from memory, he stood shoulder to shoulder with one who ruled over a harbor of stone. But in the end, the two came into conflict, and the dragon was banished to a dark place deep underground.Over the long years of his imprisonment, his power has slowly dissipated. He has also become disfigured from the various kinds of erosion he has been subjected to.The faint rattling of this dragon lord's shackles and his deep, angry growl echo through the bowels of the mountains like memories of a bygone era.
Profile
Azhdaha is the oldest of the Geovishaps and holds command over the Ley Lines.Design Notes: Azhdaha Design The Birth of a Dragon: A Behind the Scenes Look At the Creation of Azhdaha For untold years, he had slumbered in Nantianmen, deep within the earth. But when he awakened, the slightest movement would cause earthquakes which led to Morax seeking him out to stop it. He was a blind Geo lifeform that dwelled underground but wished to see surface life, so Morax unearthed him and granted him the ability to see. As part of his subsequent contract with Morax, Morax warned him that if Azhdaha ever endangered the order of Liyue, he would not hesitate to seal him back underground. Azhdaha became a friend of both Morax and humanity itself, taking a particular liking to blacksmiths.Amidst Chaos, the Rock Is Unmoved
As time passed, Azhdaha began to suffer from erosion - he forgot Morax's face and contract over time, and when humans began venturing into The Chasm (Subregion) the Chasm to mine, overexploitation of its resources damaged the Ley Lines within, causing Azhdaha much suffering. Despite Morax's attempt to halt Azhdaha's erosion by sharing his powers, Azhdaha began attacking the very humans he swore to protect, forcing the Geo Archon to intervene. Given Azhdaha's formidable strength as an ancient elemental being, Morax and the adepti had difficulty subduing the crazed Azhdaha, in a battle that began in the Chasm and wrought a path of destruction north all the way to Nantianmen. However, with Azhdaha's remaining conscience willingly accepting his fate, they were eventually able to seal his eroded self in the Dragon-Queller at Nantianmen. The clashes of elemental energy during this battle also resulted in the creation of Dragonfall.
Azhdaha would never forgive Morax for his supposed "betrayal," and was eventually able to manifest a portion of his power into a vessel called Jiu. Jiu would share her creator's hatred of Morax, but because the vessel took the form of a young child, those she met waved her anger off. Azhdaha then decided to break free from his prison by having Jiu manipulate a group of miners from The Chasm to travel to the Dragon-Queller to unearth the seal, upon which their pickaxes and his attacks would destroy it and allow him to roam Liyue once more to enact revenge. Unbeknownst to him, this attempt also allowed the remaining benevolent side of his consciousness to escape, who possessed a human - Kun Jun - to warn Morax of the plot. This would prove to be Azhdaha's undoing, as he was eventually fought and defeated by the Traveler, Zhongli (Morax's current form), and his own benevolent consciousness. The crazed Azhdaha appeared to regain a part of his sanity after exhausting his strength before being resealed, while the benevolent consciousness peacefully bid farewell to Morax.
Appearance
Azhdaha has a colossal, rotund, and heavy build with the resemblance of a crocodile, and is as large as mountains, making him one of the largest beings on Teyvat. His entire body is colored in shades of brown and black with numerous large spikes and golden gilded scales on his back. His head is layered in numerous large frills of spikes and is adorned with four long golden curved horns. He also has a large stone chin that covers his entire mouth.
His tail forms the giant tree in Nantianmen with bone branches and golden leaves, and curves upwards. He possesses thick limbs with a thickset of bark like armor. Azhdaha has Geo Crystals and entangled plants on his body as well as a pattern derived from the Liyue Geo elements across his entire body.
Depending on the element he absorbs from the ley lines, the base of his body alights and his tail is ignited with the color of that element, along with the Geo patterns.
Story
History
In the ancient past, Azhdaha was born from elemental crystallization as a Geovishap.Azhdaha claims that he was "forged of elemental crystal" zh=元素结晶创生之物 zh_tl=born from elemental crystallization, while his design notes mention that he is of the same species as Geovishaps.
For thousands of years, Azhdaha slumbered underground. When he awakened, every move he made, no matter how small, caused the earth to tremble and shake. Morax then came before Azhdaha to stop the earthquakes.The Unforged Lore The god brought the dragon above ground and granted him a pair of eyes to see the world. Eternally grateful for this gift, Azhdaha signed a contract with Morax that he would never harm humanity and Liyue, and that if he did, he would be sealed underground once more. Azhdaha accompanied Morax in the Archon War and fought alongside him to protect his people.
At some point, Azhdaha began suffering from erosion, making him forget Morax and his love for humanity. Though Morax shared his power with Azhdaha in an attempt to halt the erosion, it was futile. When miners unintentionally damaged the Ley Lines in the Chasm, it caused Azhdaha much suffering and he lashed out at the very humans he swore to protect, forcing the Geo Archon to intervene alongside Mountain Shaper, Moon Carver, and a third unknown adeptus. Given Azhdaha's formidable strength as an ancient elemental being, Morax and the adepti had difficulty subduing the crazed Azhdaha, in a battle that began in the Chasm and wrought a path of destruction north all the way to Nantianmen. However, with Azhdaha's remaining conscience willingly accepting his fate, they were eventually able to seal his eroded self in the Dragon-Queller at Nantianmen.
Present Day
Over centuries, Azhdaha's seals start to weaken, allowing him to first manifest a portion of his power into a girl named Jiu to announce his resurrection. However, this had very little effect due to Jiu's small stature and the fact that everyone appeared to have forgotten about him. It then dawned on his mind that he could escape his confinement and roam Liyue once more by attacking the seal on both sides to destroy it and free him.
Sometime after Osial's defeat, Azhdaha had Jiu travel to the Chasm and manipulate a group of miners to head to Nantianmen to excavate and break the seal with their pickaxes from the outside. Unbeknownst to him, this attempt also allowed the remaining benevolent side of his consciousness to escape, who possessed a human - Kun Jun - to warn Morax of the plot.
Azhdaha eventually fought and was defeated by the Traveler, Zhongli (Morax's current form), and his own benevolent consciousness. The crazed Azhdaha regained a part of his sanity after exhausting his strength before being resealed, while the benevolent consciousness peacefully bid farewell to Morax.
Events
During a flashback in the Moonchase Festival, Azhdaha was shown to be gazing at the night sky, with Marchosius riding on his shoulder.

<title>Realm of Consciousness</title>
<text>A realm of consciousness is a domain built on a person's consciousness which is separate from the world of Teyvat; however, events that occur within a realm of consciousness can affect the outside world. Little is known about how realms of consciousness work, and Yae Miko describes them as "very abstract concept[s]" surrounded by chaos.Radiant Sakura
Overview
As its name suggests, a realm of consciousness is a physical space which contains a person's consciousness. It can be accessed via an entrance, which takes on a form that relates to its owner. The interior of a realm of consciousness is also influenced by its owner's memories.
A person's realm of consciousness can exist even after their physical body perishes, and the person can maintain their sense of self even after their death. However, such a realm cannot be preserved indefinitely, and the owner is unable to perceive the state of the outside world or the passage of time.
Story
Makoto's
Makoto's realm of consciousness was preserved by Ei after the former's death during the cataclysm,Cleansing Light and its entrance takes the form of a torii gate. Although Ei sealed the entrance, the Shogun eventually unlocked it when their wills opposed each other to allow them to fight each other at full strength.Farewell to the Past Unbeknownst to Ei, Makoto had used her realm of consciousness so Ei could one day understand her vision of "Eternity," after which her remaining consciousness within the Musou Isshin would be awakened to give Ei the seed of the Sacred Sakura. After Ei planted the Sacred Sakura in the realm of consciousness, it took root in Inazuma's past, allowing it to protect Inazuma by absorbing the filth from the cataclysm. Afterwards, Makoto's strength and consciousness was expended, and her realm of consciousness disappeared. The Dream Sakura, which the Traveler obtained from Makoto's realm of consciousness, continues to exist in a quasi-physical form that can be seen but is intangible.
Lesser Lord Kusanali's
As part of the plan to rescue Lesser Lord Kusanali from her imprisonment in the Sanctuary of Surasthana, the Traveler entered her realm of consciousness, as she had closed off her consciousness to prevent Il Dottore from accessing her mind via the Akasha. The entrance to her realm of consciousness took the form of a newly sprouted tree branch.Jnagarbha Day
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's realm of consciousness was left behind after her death in the cataclysm and its entrance took the form of a Knowledge Capsule, which was opened after Lesser Lord Kusanali used the power of the Electro Gnosis. The Gnosis provided some protection against the forbidden knowledge corruption in Rukkhadevata's remaining consciousness. Because Rukkhadevata herself had been contaminated by forbidden knowledge during the cataclysm, her connection to Irminsul meant that it could not be healed so long as the memory of her persisted. After Kusanali erased Rukkhadevata's existence and remaining consciousness, her realm of consciousness, which Kusanali now believed to be that of Irminsul from five hundred years ago, disappeared. Without Rukkhadevata's tainted existence, Irminsul was healed and everything caused by its contamination, such as Eleazar, disappeared.Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies

* A character's Birthday Mail is only available for that particular day, from 00:00 to 23:59. The player must log in to the game during that time period to receive the mail. If a player logs on at 00:01 the following day, despite being in the same server reset cycle, the mail will not be received.
* Currently, a character's Birthday Mail is one of the only ways to receive their special dish if the player does not own the character in question. Another way to obtain certain special dishes is to unlock different endings of Hangout Events.
The Traveler
The Traveler's birth date depends on the player's choice in their profile customization and cannot be changed again once set. Once the Traveler celebrates their birthday, the Dev Team, via the mailing system, will send birthday wishes, along with a special gift of one Cake for Traveler, which rewards one Fragile Resin and an unusable version of the cake when used.
On top of this, any characters the player currently has will have their "Birthday" voice-over permanently unlocked. Future characters that the player obtains after their birthday has passed will still have their "Birthday" voice-over unlocked.
It is important to note that setting your birthday to a date that has already passed in the current year will not give you a cake. You will not receive your cake for that year.

<title>Faramarz</title>
<text>Faramarz was a historical figure in the Great Red Sand, Sumeru, who lived sometime after the death of King Deshret.
He was the son of the King Badanah and the prince of several city-states which existed in the Great Red Sand. He conspired with his lover Makhaira, who was also his father's concubine, to assassinate the obese king. Although they succeeded, the ensuing political turmoil eventually led Faramarz to assassinate Makhaira himself, while he was exiled to Dharma Forest and met an unknown fate.
He was the creator and wielder of Light of Foliar Incision.
Story
Faramarz was born to King Badanah, who united several city-states in the Great Red Sand including Tulaytullah and Saleh,Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, Primal Obelisk Sobek Oasis Sobek Oasis and was first in line to inherit the kingdom.Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, Primal Obelisk Khaj-Nisut Khaj-Nisut Badanah indulged in food, wine, hunting, and conquest, and gathered a harem of concubines which included the sword dancer Makhaira.Makhaira AquamarineLamp of the Lost
Both Faramarz and Makhaira foresaw that Badanah's rule would lead the kingdom to its destruction. The two met each other during nighttime to plot Badanah's assassination, and during that time became lovers. They drew up a plan to use the Badanah's love for hunting to lure him into a trap; based on various accounts related to Badanah's death, they used his falcon to lead him into a structurally unstable tower, which then collapsed under the obese king's weight and sent him plummeting to his doom. Following Badanah's death, the tower was destroyed and the hunting falcons were killed to be buried with the king.
Ascension and Troubled Reign
With his father dead, Faramarz ascended the throne as the new king. However, his reign was a tumultuous one.
Due to his relatively young age, Makhaira became the queen-regent and took a more active role of meeting with their retainers to discuss the affairs of state. For unknown reasons, Faramarz abdicated for a first time in favor of his uncle Balash, the master of Tulaytullah, and moved to the Emerald Palace. Another of his uncles, Goraz, then raised an army against Balash to reinstate Faramarz. While Goraz was successful and Balash was implied to have died in the conflict, Faramarz was moved back to the Emerald Palace while Goraz and Makhaira ruled as co-regents. This eventually led to Goraz usurping Faramarz entirely, taking the throne for himself with Makhaira as his queen and exiling Faramarz.
Balash's earlier deposition did not sit well with the nobles of Tulaytullah, who rose up in revolt in response. Goraz was slain and Makhaira offered the rebels his head to appease them. Faramarz was reinstated for a second time, only for the people of Saleh to rise up themselves in hopes of gaining independence and reestablishing their original Khaganate. Once again, Makhaira appeased them.
Another twelve of Faramarz's uncles proceeded to each vie for the throne, leading to a protracted war. Although Faramarz eventually emerged victorious and took the throne for a fourth time, he grew wary of Makhaira's penchant for aligning with whoever best served her interest towards the throne and assassinated her with a viper's venom. Sometime afterwards, a conspiracy forced Faramarz into exile one last time, and he departed for Dharma Forest.
Exile to the Forest
With the little wealth he had remaining, Faramarz departed for Dharma Forest, hoping to conquer it. However, he often encountered a huntress wielding a white bow - likely Hunter's Path, a relic of the woodsScholar of Vines - and was repelled time and time again. She issued him a warning, which he chose to ignore: '"You belong to neither the forest nor death, so stay far from the king's palace."' After several years of this routine, he encountered the "teachings of death" and came to understand the huntress' warning, but decided to embrace his fate and died in the woods, metaphorically described as being "accepted by the beneficient dream."Wandering Evenstar</text>

<title>Inazuman Script</title>
<text>The Inazuman Script ('unofficial name') refers to the writing system of Inazuma.
The script is based on the Teyvat alphabetBilibili:  and appears to be inspired by Japanese hiragana. It can be found written vertically from top-to-bottom, right-to-left, as with various traditional East Asian scripts, or it can be written horizontally. The glyphs used in the Inazuma script correspond to letters of the Latin alphabet instead of Japanese 'kana'. The texts written in this script are based on romaji romanized Japanese.
Deciphering
While the Inazuman alphabet is used to represent romanized Japanese, in most cases, the Inazuman text does not correspond directly to each letter of the romaji. Typically, only the first letter of each syllable is rendered in Inazuman. Therefore, all syllables that start with the same consonant are typically rendered the same. For example, か, き, く, け, and こ ('ka', 'ki', 'ku', 'ke', and 'ko') would all be written as the Inazuman symbol for "K" (よ⇁). There is a large variation in which other letters are rendered. Voicing is sometimes ignored, such that て ('te') may be written with the symbol of "D" instead. Long vowels and ん ('n') are sometimes omitted. The letters in consonant digraphs such as 'sh', 'ch', and 'ts' are sometimes both written. Further complicating matters, in longer texts which correspond to Japanese, some Inazuman symbols which would normally not be expected in romanized Japanese such as "L," "V," or "X" show up and may actually represent other sounds instead. This ambiguity and variation makes it difficult to decipher Inazuman texts, especially without context.

<title>Resurgent Cryo Regisvine</title>
<text>the event boss the standard variant Cryo Regisvine
The Resurgent Cryo Regisvine is a special event boss for Act IV of The Chalk Prince and the Dragon.
Description
During Act IV: Uninvited Guest, Reckless Pallad was found by Sucrose, Albedo, and the Traveler while discussing Festering Desire. While the group was attacked by the Fatui Enemies Fatui, he developed hypothermia and afterwards stumbled towards the sword, thinking it to be a heat source. He knocked the sword onto the ground, resulting in its restorative powers being transferred to the stump of a dead Cryo Regisvine, transforming it into the Resurgent Cryo Regisvine.
This boss has two different versions of its fight: the first, during the Uninvited Guests Story Quest, can only be fought once; and the second, fought during The Chalk Prince and the Dragon Act IV - Uninvited Guests Frostborn Miracle, has slightly different mechanics. Both fights are located south of the waypoint at Entombed City - Outskirts.
The second fight can be repeated indefinitely and upon completion, gives the player 100-150 Miraculous Essence, depending on World Level.
Mechanics
During the fight, the Resurgent Cryo Regisvine's power will erupt. Seeds of Winter will be generated, and the player needs to break them to generate shields that protect against this eruption. Breaking the seeds generally takes 1-2 Normal Attacks. Otherwise, the player will continuously take large amounts of Cryo DMG.
This boss is unique to The Chalk Prince and the Dragon event. While retaining most of its Normal Attacks, it also has new attacks up its sleeve:
First Phase
In the first phase, the boss cannot be attacked directly and is protected by a shield made out of Frost Thorns. The player must use Scarlet Quartz-imbued attacks to destroy three of the Frost Thorns.
* Minor threats such as Slimes Cryo Slimes (or Large Cryo Slimes and Whopperflowers Cryo Whopperflowers if playing in Co-Op) will continuously spawn during this phase. The player must defeat these minor threats in order to obtain Scarlet Quartz used to break the Resurgent Cryo Regisvine's shield.
* Ice rain will leave patches of Cryo, dealing additional Cryo DMG when walking within its AoE.
* When the Frost Thorn shield is broken, the Regisvine reawaken, behaving like its original incarnation. Simply attack its weak spots to stun it, leaving it vulnerable to subsequent combo attacks.
** A Snowstorm will also be summoned at the beginning of the reawakening phase.
Second Phase
After recovering, a Seed of Winter will periodically spawn near Ruin Braziers (Strangely, the navigation shows a Commission icon). This is a clear warning that the boss will soon spawn a powerful attack that can almost guarantee a team wipe out if not avoided.
* The boss will erupt its powers to summon a deadly snowstorm that puts the whole stage into a huge patch of Cryo, dealing tremendous damage per second. Usually 3 ticks will be enough to kill a character.
** Afterwards, it will perform its usual three-smash combo in which trails of icicles will erupt on the ground and then will erupt again. Both attacks will be done three times.
* The Seed of Winter will generate a Cryo shield that shields the player(s) against the eruption but not its three-smash attacks.
* Three Scarlet Quartzes will spawn periodically during this phase.
Final Phase
Upon spending all of its power, the Resurgent Cryo Regisvine will blast ice to the inner ring to create a path of damaging ice before it rises up to conjure a blizzard, raining down ice shards to the player characters. After this, the cycle of phases will repeat again.
Strategy
During Uninvited Guests
*This version of the Resurgent Cryo Regisvine can be fought like a regular Cryo Regisvine.
*You will still have to break Seeds of Winter to protect against the power eruption of the Resurgent Cryo Regisvine.
During Frostborn Miracle
* This version can be fought in co-op, which will reduce the amount of time necessary to complete a run and is useful for farming.
*Note that in co-op, the enemies spawned alongside the boss (typically small Slimes) are upgraded to Whopperflowers and large slimes, making it harder to obtain crystal agate. Therefore, the boss is arguably more challenging on co-op mode without the right teammates.
General Tips
* Unlike most other bosses, accessing the inventory does not pause the battle. If you want to revive or heal, be sure to do so quickly or while protected by Seed of Winter shields.
* The use of Barbara as a healer is risky, just like the fight with Andrius, as you might get frozen while dodging.
* The use of the event weapon Festering Desire is highly recommended. Complete the previous 3 Acts to unlock the weapon's event-exclusive abilities and equip it onto your strongest sword-using character. The event abilities effectively double the sword's DPS.
* Bring 2 Pyro characters if obtained, as this not only boosts your attack by 25% via the Elemental Resonance, but it also allows you to take down the root shield efficiently using Pyro Elemental Skills and Bursts.
First Phase
* When the battle commences, icicles will rain from above. An indicator will appear on the ground before the icicle appears, leaving 1–2 seconds to dodge.
* Stay around the Ruin Braziers if possible to enter the rest of the boss fight with minimal sheer cold, as you will not have much time to heat up in the second phase.
* The icicles deal considerable Cryo DMG and tend to target the location of or around your character.
* Icicles leave patches of ice that do low Cryo DMG if stepped on.
* After 20 seconds, the icicle rain will cease. This allows you to focus on damaging the slimes to obtain crimson agates. Try to defeat enough slimes and sprint to melt the frost thorns before the icicle rain commences again
Second Phase
* After the shield is broken, the boss will charge up like the normal Cryo Regisvine. Place down Xiangling's Guoba or Amber's Baron Bunny if you are using said characters.
* When the HP bar for the shield appears, attack it with Pyro attacks. Anemo attacks work relatively well as they can Swirl Pyro for further damage.
* Pick up Crimson Agates to deal Pyro DMG and melt the shield.
* It has 4 main attacks that are identical in nature to the normal Cryo Regisvine:
** A faceplant, which deals damage down a straight line. It can be dodged by dashing aside just before the Regisvine's corolla hits the ground.
** A body slam, which deals damage in a large circular area around the boss. You can dodge by using the immunity frame of the dash, or simply dash out of the attack's area of effect
** A blast of about 10 homing icicles, which deal moderate Cryo DMG if all are allowed to connect. There is no need to dodge all of them, but most can be dodged by dashing just before they hit the player
** Two ice beams shot in an X-pattern. Dodge by dashing directly left or right, or towards the boss.
* After the shield is down, the boss is stunned just like the normal Regisvine for 15 seconds.
* Hit the boss with your strongest attacks. The Overloaded reaction works well as it deals Pyro DMG, and the contributing Pyro and Electro elements both deal bonus damage to the Cryo boss. However, the boss cannot be frozen by Hydro attacks at any point.
* You can pick up Crimson Agates for additional Pyro DMG - if a decently leveled Festering Desire with abilities unlocked is used, it can take out up to a third of the boss's HP in one hit.
* If you cannot deal more than a third of the boss's health in this entire DPS window, it is a sign that your characters and gear may be underleveled, and defeating the boss will require more time and skill.
Third Phase
* After recovering from the first knockdown, a Seed of Winter will periodically spawn near Ruin Braziers (Strangely, the navigation shows a Commission icon). This is a clear warning that the boss will soon spawn a powerful attack (indicated by its "power erupting") that can almost guarantee a team wipeout if not avoided.
* After the initial location of the Seed of Winter is indicated, you have 5 seconds to rush there and attack the seed (which should break in 1-2 hits) to activate the shield. The shield will protect you from the full duration of the attack once activated.
* The eruption destroys any remaining Crimson Agates on the battlefield.
* While protected, you have a 10-second window to revive and heal any fallen characters. Alternatively, use Amber's Charged Attack to hit the boss's shield, which is now on its corolla.
* After the attack ends, the shield will dissipate and the boss will carry out 3 successive faceplant attacks. It is recommended that you focus on dodging them instead of breaking the boss's shield as you will soon need to break the next Seed of Winter and shield yourself from the power eruption. If knocked down by the faceplants, you might not make it to the seed in time.
Final Phase
* This sequence (power eruption, then faceplant) happens thrice assuming you do not break the corolla shield. After the third power eruption, the Resurgent Cryo Regisvine will blast ice to the inner ring to create a path of damaging ice before it rises up to conjure a blizzard, raining down ice shards to the player characters. This hinders visibility somewhat and the shield shifts back to the roots.
* Take down the shield with the same strategy that you did before while dodging the raining icicles, except that your approach needs to be more offensive. Save the Elemental Bursts of your Pyro characters for this phase as it is challenging to deal consistent damage to the shield while dodging the nonstop attacks.
* If you do not defeat the boss in this DPS window, the cycle repeats with Seeds of Winter respawning around Ruin Braziers.
Known Bugs
Certain bugs can be encountered in Co-op mode:
*When starting the match, the Resurgent Cryo Regisvine may be seen idling.
*The Resurgent Cryo Regisvine may unusually also perform its Blizzard attack despite it only does this in the final phase.
**Aside from this, it may also keep on performing its spin attack where it fills the surrounding ground with patches of Cryo.
*Sometimes the shield provided by Seeds of Winter will disappear during the Resurgent Cryo Regisvine's eruption, thus resulting in a wipe out.
**Strangely, one of the player characters in the team will be left unharmed.
*In the First Phase, when the Cryo shield that encases the Resurgent Cryo Regisvine is broken, sometimes it will not be awakened at all.</text>

<title>Fantastic Compass</title>
<text>The Fantastic Compass is a magical device that the Traveler encounters during Interlude Chapter: Act II - Perilous Trail in the quests End of the Line (Quest) End of the Line and At Tunnel's End, Light, and domain Realm of Snaring Illusions.
Tutorial
Fantastic Compass
Lore
The Chasm's Bed Lore
The Fantastic Compass is a magic device created by an unknown individual in ages past to seal away evil monsters, which later came into Sea Gazer's possession.YouTube:  (Video Description) Later, Sea Gazer became good friends with a human and gave the device to him to use as a catalyst. A few years later, great demons began haunting the mountains and the mortal and the adeptus joined forces to exorcise them using this device.At Tunnel's End, Light
500 years ago, Boyang and Rongzhao, two brothers who were ancestors of Yelan, were gifted the Fantastic Compass by someone of great importance. Perhaps Yelan's clan studied the device because Yelan mentions that the compass is very similar to catalysts made by her clan that only they know how to use.Danger All Around
When the cataclysm began, the two brothers were ordered by the Qixing to take the compass with them to aid the Millelith in the battle at The Chasm (Area) The Chasm against the monsters of the Abyss.Note of Unknown Origin During the fight, they discovered The Chasm's Bed and lured the monsters deeper into the depths of the Chasm. Together, Boyang and Bosacius used the Fantastic Compass to seal the intersection between the Chasm's Bed and the rest of the Chasm, granting Liyue victory over the monsters with the compass being lost since then.
Much later on, Yanfei found a will in an old book. The writer of the will had wished to find the Fantastic Compass and wrote that they gave the magical device to Boyang someone ambitious, hoping it'd be handy in times of need. According to Yanfei, an eye-witness account said the person who received it took it into The Chasm and the device has been missing since. This implies that the writer of the will is the one who gifted the Compass to Boyang. The book that the will was in describes the device: "When mortal and adepti powers are combined, one can move the heavens and shake the earth. This contraption is proof that mortals and adepti may coexist, that there is unity between heaven and humanity."
During 'Perilous Trail', Yanfei, Yelan, Arataki Itto, Kuki Shinobu, the Traveler, and Paimon found themselves trapped in the Chasm's Bed. Although they wouldn't be able to find the original compass, the group devises a plan to use the The Chasm's Bed Effects abilities of the Chasm's Bed against it by imagining the compass so that the Chasm's Bed will conjur it. Yanfei then attempts to use the device to see if it works, since she has both adepti and human lineage; the device activated but only for a moment since Yanfei is not strong enough. The brief activation seemed to trigger something, causing the voices of Boyang and Bosacius to be heard from when they made the seal:
Sound From Within the Compass: By heaven's might and the gods of the five regions, yaksha and mortal together take this contraption in hand...
After Yanfei tested the device, Yelan and Xiao activated the device together to escape The Chasm's Bed. Because the compass they used was a conjuring of The Chasm's Bed and not the original, the group was unable to take it out with them when they escaped.</text>

Official Introduction
Nilou: The dance of the lotus blooms, awakening from an ethereal dream
What's so great about that little theater? If she went with me on tour all around Teyvat, she could earn so much Mora, more than what she could ever dream of... Alas, she's too innocent. So innocent that she knows nothing of her own worth.
If you have time, don't miss the performance at the Zubayr Theater.
Against a backdrop of lights and music, Nilou's graceful demeanor resembles that of an unsullied lotus flower, her delicate dance leading the audience into a world of fantasy.
When the performance comes to an end, the audience is brought back to reality, often in a trance.
"The girl dancing on stage is so beautiful, she looks straight out of a fairy tale."
But those who are close to Nilou know that she is very different from the aloof image she portrays on stage.
Once Nilou steps off the stage, she is like any girl her age: sweet, warm, and smiling.
If you meet Nilou off-stage, don't be intimidated. Say hello to her, and she'll be very happy about it.
Character Stories
"Since you're in Sumeru, you must not miss Nilou's performances."This is a fact that most people in Sumeru agree on.There is no threshold for Nilou's dances, so everyone can come and enjoy a most fascinating and engrossing time there.Nilou's audience comes from all walks of life. Be it a knowledgeable researcher or a mercenary who's seen true brutality - everyone is attracted here by Nilou's gorgeous, dancing form.Every time Nilou takes the stage, a press of people crowds the Grand Bazaar until all are standing shoulder to shoulder.Rational sense and wisdom are the mainstream in Sumeru, while art, which stands for sensibility, does not enjoy the same popularity and respect.Yet if wisdom is meaning bestowed upon Sumeru by the goddess, then art stands for meaning that human beings seek for themselves.
Unlike other dancers across the continent who hail from artistic families, Nilou came from an ordinary family in Sumeru.The life that the family of three once lived was no different from that of many who lived in downtown area.The knowledge they gained from the Akasha was enough for their common day-to-day lives.If there was anything special about Nilou's family, it was that Nilou's parents' loved and cared for her very much.Although the pursuit of scholarship is prevalent in Sumeru, Nilou's parents never compared Nilou with other children, nor did they expect Nilou to become a researcher.Growing up happily and living a stable life was all that they wanted for her.Nilou thus grew up surrounded by love and respect.Later, even when there were differences of opinion and occasional arguments between her parents, Nilou's thoughtful and considerate mediation would permit no harm or grudge to ever linger in their family.
Every inch of the Grand Bazaar has been measured by Nilou's footprints, and she keeps everyone at Grand Bazaar in her heart.Nilou can introduce anyone in the Grand Bazaar in detail, as if they were a family member.Jut Mr. Jut usually gets up early to make tahchin, so if you want the privilege of having the most delicious bite of freshly cooked tahchin, be sure to get up early!Afshin Mr. Afshin's storytelling skills are simply divine. His wonderful ingenuity always makes people want to buy his merchandise.Hushang Mr. Hushang, who sells toys, has very dexterous hands. With them, he fashions the most fascinating little toys, and they are very popular amongst children.And, of course, everyone has long regarded this smart red-haired girl as a family member too.Every time Nilou goes grocery shopping, she always ends up carrying more items than on her purchase list just by making a single trip through the streets, and the weight of the groceries shows exactly how much people like and take care of Nilou.Of course, Nilou also takes care of them in return.Hushang and Farhad may have a quarrel over a bet, about as long as Nilou shows up, the two will surely be reconciled.If Afshin's Sumpter Beasts have stolen someone else's food, Nilou will come forward and help make amends.If you ask Nilou why she is so enthusiastic, she will answer with a smile:"Because family is supposed to help each other, hehe."For Nilou, her mom and dad are her small family, while everyone in the Grand Bazaar is her big family.
Nilou remembers clearly that she met her teacher at the Sabzeruz Festival when she was eight years old.Back then, the Knight of Flowers gave her a lot of Yalda Candies, and so little Nilou passed by the Zubayr Theater with candies in both hands.The Sabzeruz Festival is a celebration that features dance, but before, only dance groups from abroad were invited to sing and dance at the festival - and on a temporary stage, to boot.Now that the Grand Bazaar finally had its own theater, excited people were flocking to the new stage.Little Nilou managed to squeeze through the crowd to the front of the stage and saw the teacher dance for the first time.Even though there were no flowers on the stage, at that moment, Nilou felt as if she was watching thousands upon thousands of flowers blooming all at once.The candies in her hands fell to the ground unnoticed, and she couldn't help but dance along.It was only when the dance had ended that little Nilou realized what she had done, and hurriedly apologized to the people around her who had made room.It was at this moment that her teacher also walked down from the stage in an elegant manner and helped her pick the Yalda Candies back up.She reached out her hand to little Nilou, and asked gracefully-"Would you like to join me for a future dance?"
Although she has lived her entire life in Sumeru, the city of wisdom, Nilou has never shown any talent in the field of "knowledge." However, she always knows how to soothe the emotions of others in her own way."This is probably a generous gift to me from Lesser Lord Kusanali."After learning to dance with her teacher, Nilou became deeply aware of the power of body language.Combining her talents and knowledge of body language, she created her very own form of "body movement therapy."For example, when Sheikh Zubayr Mr. Zubayr is angry, everyone in the theater would be walking on eggshells.But Nilou would keep a warm smile, drawing wonderful patterns one after another in the air with her arms and fingers."Imagine that we are in the rainforest that has just rained, and that you are following me as we walk onward, saying hello to every animal that passes by, waving, leaving everything else behind..."Perhaps this may seem childish and funny to a bystander, but for those who are wrapped up in the moment, Nilou's gentle voice can cause the anger that clouds their minds to disappear before they even know it.What's even more amazing is that, according to Mr. Afshin, this body movement therapy has been trending recently - and it even works on his two stubborn Sumpter Beasts...
Be it in day-to-day life or her performances on stage, Nilou has always maintained a simple attitude-To melt everyone's worries away and let comfort and ease waltz in.But when "trouble" comes to her, she is often distressed due to her inability to make the call.Tahchin sure is delicious, but Pita Pocket is also good, and I also saw someone holding a Potato Boat that seemed really yummy. Which one should I eat tonight?I've heard people talk about places outside Sumeru City... the pure white snowy mountain and windmills the size of giants... Should I also consider going out for a trip?Nilou can often find good reasons to go with any of the options she is considering, and so they are like Forest Tree Frogs sitting across from one another with bellies out, not one able to win the others over.But if there was a person who could make a decision at this time and tell her with confidence and calm:"Why not have half the amount of each and share them with me?""And as for those places you have never been to, I have already set foot there. I can assure you that they are safe."...Nilou would dismiss her hesitation in an instant and raise her arms in a dance-like graceful gesture of thanks, before indulging in the joy of having solved a great problem for a long time indeed.
Refusing to accept gifts on stage has been a long-standing rule in the Zubayr Theater.Sometimes, the audiences do still get too excited and may insist on giving various kinds of gifts to Nilou. That said, such givers will definitely receive a gift in return the very next day, along with a note that has been left at their doors..."Thank you for your kindness. If you would like to express your love for Nilou's dance, you may write a letter to the Zubayr Theater instead of sending gifts."And so it came to pass that like snow flakes dancing and falling in the air, letters filled with the audience members' passionate praise have been sent in batches and droves by the Dusk Birds to the theater's mailbox.During her free time when there are no shows or rehearsals, Nilou will read every letter carefully, share this joy with the other members of the Zubayr Theater, and then carefully preserve these letters.Every word and every expression of recognition and fondness in the letters is worth remembering and appreciating.As Nilou bettered her dancing skills, more and more people came to watch her dance, and in time, the letters have added up to quite the stack indeed.But if someone cracks a joke, saying that Nilou is the most valuable treasure in the Zubayr Theater, she will definitely shake her head with a sweet smile."Our most valuable treasure is our audience's love, and it is all carefully stored in one mysterious box."
Nilou has heard her teacher talk about the meaning of dance more than once. From her teacher's perspective, dance is born from human life and has belonged to everyone from the very beginning."As a dancer, you should convey emotions on stage, and your audience's smiles are their response to the emotions conveyed in your dance."Nilou was well aware that she was nowhere near as good at thinking about the "meaning" behind things as Akademiya researchers. But still, she practiced diligently each day under the direction of her teacher and planned to continue following in her footsteps.When she finally first took the stage, she quickly became completely immersed in the performance, holding nothing back.She thought of the wind, the moon, the gentle sound of the rose blooming, the feeling of stroking the tail feathers of Dusk Birds, and a myriad of beautiful things that existed in this world.She wanted to display the beauty she perceived in her heart to the entire audience through her dance.Slowly, splashes of water ran together, converging into a lake on the stage. Like a Crystalfly dancing on a lake's surface, Nilou gently fluttered back and forth, and the lake-mirror rippled slightly in time to her steps.Like a water lily, her body swirled in the middle of that lake. Amazed at such pure and flawless beauty, the audience almost forgot to breathe.After the curtain fell, Nilou flopped down on the backstage chair and took deep breaths.Like dewdrops on a lotus leaf, a Hydro Vision had appeared at her waist.Nilou thought then that she had perhaps found the purpose of dance at last -"To become beauty, and then to convey the beauty and value of art."

<title>Burning</title>
<text>Elemental Reactions in Genius Invokation TCG Genius Invokation TCG/Rules Elemental Reactions
Elemental Gauge Theory
Burning will apply a Burning aura, which appears as an animated version of the Pyro aura and will coexist with the underlying Pyro and Dendro auras. The Dendro aura will be steadily consumed while burning. The Burning state requires both the Burning and Dendro auras to maintain, and will end if one of them is depleted.
Burning cannot damage off-field characters. Switching to a different character while affected by Burning will temporarily pause the DoT ticks, but the Dendro consumption will continue. If the affected character becomes the active character again while still affected by Dendro, they will resume taking DMG.

Tutorial
Elemental Reaction: Burning
Immunity
Some enemies, even ones not immune to Pyro DMG itself, are immune to Burning DMG, including its Poise Damage and Pyro application. The list of enemies include:
* Pyro Slime
* Large Pyro Slime
* Pyro Specter
* Pyro Hilichurl Shooter
* Hilichurl Berserker
* Hilichurl Grenadier
* Pyro Whopperflower
* Blazing Axe Mitachurl
* Pyro Abyss Mage
* Abyss Lector: Fathomless Flames
* Pyro Hypostasis
* Pyro Regisvine
Note that all enemies that are immune to Burning DMG have the Pyro Element in some form, but not all Pyro enemies have Burning immunity (e.g., Fatui Skirmisher - Pyroslinger Bracer).
Environment
Grass
Burning can be inflicted on Wood objects by applying Pyro to them. Burning can also be inflicted on Pyro objects, such as lit bonfires and stoves, by applying Dendro to them. Units that are Burning will also spread fire to combustible objects that they touch such as grass.
In the open world, grass, haystacks, shrubs, small trees, crates, and barrels are all Wood objects. After being burned, grass will be charred and cannot be burned again until the area resets, while shrubs and small trees will be temporarily destroyed.
The amount of Pyro DMG dealt by Burning objects will vary:
* Burning grass DMG will scale with the grass's own level.
* Burning bushes will not deal DMG at all, but will still apply Pyro.
* Burning inflicted on any other objects will deal DMG based on the stats of the character who triggered the reaction.
Although Tri-Lakshana Creatures that are not enemies are Dendro objects and react normally with Hydro and Electro to produce the Bloom and Quicken reactions, they do not react normally with Pyro. Applying Pyro to them immediately removes their Dendro status and does not cause the Burning reaction.

<title>Erosion</title>
<text>Erosion is a general term for the process of getting mentally erosion, or worn down, by a combination of factors affecting someone's life, including natural memory loss as well as emotional loss or experiencing traumatic events. Eventually, erosion will cause a person to lose their sense of self. Even powerful, long-lived beings like gods and elemental dragons are susceptible to erosion.
Effects of Erosion
Erosion naturally occurs over time and is both caused by and causes the loss of memories. Eventually, it will result in the loss of one's consciousness and sense of self, making them more irritable and suspect to explosive fits of rage; as a result, the more powerful a person is, the more dangerous they become under the effects of erosion. Zhongli, the current form of the former Geo Archon Morax, indirectly confirms the Traveler's suspicions that erosion was one of his motivations for stepping down from his position.Amidst Chaos, the Rock Is Unmoved
Currently, the only entity known to have completely succumbed to erosion is Azhdaha. He lost his memories of Morax, Liyue Harbor, and his coexistence with humanity despite Morax's attempts to delay Azhdaha's erosion. Mining at The Chasm (Subregion) The Chasm damaged the ley lines, which inflicted pain on Azhdaha. Already irritable from the effects of erosion, Azhdaha flew into a rage and lashed out at the miners, forcing Morax and three of the adepti to seal him away underneath the Dragon-Queller. With what little consciousness he had left, Azhdaha willingly allowed himself to be sealed away; however, over time, erosion wore away his memories of his choice, leading him to believe Morax a tyrant.
Preventing Erosion
Morax shared with us some of his power, to prevent further erosion. But... it was futile. Everything returns to dust. It is the natural order, an unstoppable force.
Two attempts at stalling or circumventing erosion have been mentioned.
The first is Zhongli's attempt to halt Azhdaha's erosion by sharing his powers with Azhdaha, which ultimately failed. According to Azhdaha and Zhongli, erosion is part of the "natural order" and is "imposed" by the Heavenly Principles.
The second is Ei's creation of the Shogun, an autonomous puppet designed with the explicit purpose of withstanding erosion. Following the losses she sustained during the cataclysm, Ei became fixated on "eternity," hoping to preserve Inazuma's prosperity forever. Aware that her spirit was susceptible to erosion, she created the Shogun, who would rule Inazuma in her stead while she secluded herself within the Plane of Euthymia to stave off erosion through meditation. Because Ei believed she could potentially become an enemy of eternity herself, she deliberately made the Shogun's operational rules difficult to change even by herself, as change would not be conducive towards eternity.The Lonesome Euthymia</text>

<title>Snezhnaya</title>
<text>She is a god with no love left for her people, nor do they have any left for her.Her followers only hope to be on her side when the day of her rebellion against Celestia Relationship to the Archons the divine comes at last. Dainsleif, Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: TravailYouTube:
Snezhnaya ru=Снежная ru_rm=Snezhnaya is one of the seven regions of Teyvat. It is the nation that worships Tsaritsa, the Cryo Archon. The Fatui, a military force under her control, is particularly notorious for their diehard devotion and their unscrupulous methods in enacting her will.
Archon Quest Chapter VI takes place in this region.
Description
Snezhnaya is a region of perpetual winter storms; Nadia states that blizzards can last for a month straight and despite being in the midst of danger, its people look up to the sky and are just happy to be alive. Tartaglia Childe claims that people would literally freeze to death if they didn't keep moving outside.
Technologically, Snezhnaya is much more advanced than the other regions on Teyvat. Venti states that the Fatui are the strongest out of the seven regions' military, which is supported by the fact that all of their known fighting members utilize elemental attacks. The description for Agent's Sacrificial Knife calls it a "weapon made with superior Snezhnayan technology." The Fatui Skirmishers wear mechanical suits of varying degrees, and some of its members use guns and cannons in battle. Alice, who has visited Snezhnaya, recalls seeing massive factories, which she wrote down in her Teyvat Travel Guide, and Il Dottore built a factory in Liyue to conduct Ruin Guard research which is fully automated.Defender of Childhood Dreams
The Adventurers' Guild originates from Snezhnaya;Lan while this fact doesn't seem to be a secret, few people comment on it and the Guild doesn't face the same apprehension that people regard the Fatui with. It was also hinted that Katheryne, the receptionist(s) for the Adventurers' Guild, are a series of androids created for the role: the Katherynes in all regions so far are identical, and have "Error..." and "Rebooting..." idle quotes. This is further emphasized by the Katheryne stationed in Liyue, as she side-steps the Traveler questioning about her identity. Katheryne's identity as a "bionic Snezhnayan puppet" was confirmed by Nahida.Dawn (Quest)</text>

<title>Mona/Lore</title>
<text>A mysterious young astrologer who proclaims herself to be "Astrologist Mona Megistus," and who possesses abilities to match the title. Erudite, but prideful.Though she is often strapped for cash and lives a life of thrift, she is resolved to never use astrology for profit... It is this very resolution that has caused her to constantly fret about money.
Personality
A mysterious young astrologer who proclaims herself to be "Astrologist Mona Megistus," and who possesses abilities to match the title. Erudite, but prideful.
Mona is an astrologist who takes her passion seriously. She is very knowledgeable in this subject in part and respects, yet also fears Barbeloth, her master, at the same time. She combines her astrology skills with hydromancy, which makes her a well-known, if still growing astrologist. In part due to her astrology, Mona can tell whether or not a person is lying, can sense their intentions from a single glance, being capable of seeing their fate and is able to accurately deduce a person's traits just from knowing what their constellation is.
Being obsessed with astrology gives Mona a sense of pride, but this also serves as a double-edged sword; any Mora she gets her hands on is immediately spent on astrology-related materials, regardless of its cost. She only realizes too late when she has run out of Mora to meet her daily needs, occasionally going without shelter or food for days on end. She is particularly picky when it comes to eating, as she prefers simple dishes when eating out; when she cooks, she makes the most out of whatever she can buy.Mona She does not tolerate those who disrespect her.Where Ancient Stars Align She also makes a lot of denials when someone is pointing out what she doesn't have.
Appearance
Flowing Fate Pact of Stars and Moon
Mona uses the Medium Female Characters medium female model. She has fair skin, pale sea green eyes, and waist-length dark purple hair that turns slightly red at the ends. Her fringe is uneven.
Official Introduction
Mona:The shining stars above have long decided the fate of all.
Astrologist Mona Megistus's essays are truly fascinating. Not that I really get it, but it's super interesting nonetheless.
Mona is unique among astrologers - others may speak with great ostentation for money, but Mona has never done so. Nor does she dress up or mince her words, even if her results are unpleasant to hear: "You won't amount to anything even if you join the Adventurers' Guild." "You've got no chance with him. In fact, he will soon leave you" - such is the nature of her rejoinders.
Her blunt nature has resulted in plummeting numbers of people coming to have their fortunes told. But Mona isn't one to complain, for that just leaves her with more time for her personal research.
But when one speaks of research, one also speaks of the necessity of purchasing texts and research apparatus. Mona's only income comes from her contributions to The Steambird's "All Things Astrological" column. Every paycheck is spent first on her research. Books from Liyue, an astrolabe from Sumeru... all of these come with a hefty price tag, and by the time Mona regains her senses, there's only enough of her income left for her to scrape by each month.
"It matters not. Astrologers must rid themselves of material desires. Only by ridding oneself of clutter can one see the true world around them." So says Mona, coughing loudly all the while to cover the sound of her growling stomach.
Today, too, is another day Mona worries about Mora.
Character Stories
Teyvat is a place where people of all sorts go about their business. Merchants move products, knights patrol, and farmers till the land.But if one were to ask Mona - the enigmatic and prideful astrologist - what she busies herself with, she will reply by saying that she is servicing a debt known as "life."She will, however, vigorously deny being "poor," giving the following explanation:"Beautiful veneers may obscure simple truths.Exquisite food may mask its nutritional value.One lives simply, all the better to expose this world's truths."A frugal lifestyle, therefore, is a form of training to access the truth... Or so Mona will insist.Teyvat is a place where people of all sorts go about their business, and even an enigmatic astrologist must look to hers.-That said, it seems like bards might be the exception to this rule.
Recently, Barbeloth Mona's teacher, an old but highly skilled female astrologist, has entrusted a very important task to her.Her teacher has an Alice erstwhile rival-friend in Mondstadt, and she wanted Mona to retrieve a highly confidential box from that person's successor."If you dare look inside that books... Well, you'll see."That was the warning Mona received before departing.To Mona's surprise, this successor was none other than the Spark Knight, Klee.The box was still extant, but due to Klee's actions and a series of accidents... Mona unwittingly unraveled the enigma behind the box."I-I'm done for. The thing inside this was the dark history of her youth... she will kill me if I go back like this..."Mona was thus forced to stay in Mondstadt, beginning a bitterly frugal but bountifully fulfilling existence.
Mona's astrology utilizes hydromancy, and she once explained the underlying principles thusly:"It is people's fate that shines in the night sky, and though its reflection in water is but an illusion, it reveals the truth nonetheless."No one else can quite comprehend this principle, but Mona's ability convinces people to believe in it anyway.Albeit, sometimes grudgingly...Her astrological readings are exceptionally precise, and she will neither lie nor hold anything back when revealing the results of her readings."Your son says that he's made it. That's a lie.""You've got no chance with him. In fact, he will soon leave you."The cold, hard truth is laid bare before people's eyes, complete with all the grisly details that they would rather remained buried.Mona will make no exceptions to this, and as such she can seem completely lacking in human emotion.But sometimes, on a clear night, she can be seen on a high mountain slope.There, Mona gazes up at the stars in the sky - so close, she feels, that she could almost reach out and touch them - with gentle eyes, humming an unknown tune to herself.
Having never studied the art of finance, the astrologist Mona is always hovering around the poverty line.In order to save on food expenses, she once ate mushrooms for an entire month straight. If not for some relief funds coming from time to time, she would have had trouble eking out a living.Mona does in fact have some money set aside. Even though she must eventually run dry without an income, she can slow the bleeding by scrimping in the food department.So where does the rest of the Mora go? Well, if you've ever had a look inside her lab, then know that the big pile of astrology-related apparatus and tools in there didn't come out of thin air.In fact, all of them come with a hefty price tag - books from Liyue, an astrolabe from Sumeru... The shipping fees alone are impressive.That Mona should be in abject poverty comes, therefore, as no surprise.In order to support herself, Mona eventually took up a commercial contract - her contributions to a column about constellation in The Steambird have become her most stable income source.Now having a monthly income, Mona could have left her life of poverty. But how could an astrologist's pursuit of knowledge end here?Whenever she gets paid, Mona will immediately shell out on more astrology-related resources, returning to a state of destitution once more.This process plays out every month.Today, too, is another day Mona worries over Mora.
Mona will sometimes meet up with Klee and Albedo, her primary reason being to get a free meal.Secondary to that is to exchange pointers with Albedo.Since they are both people who seek to unveil the principles of the world, and both are accomplished students of famed masters, aligning themselves with one another and working together is perfectly normal.Mona staunchly defends her teacher's image in front of Albedo.However, she also often complains about "that old hag.""You speak of your illustrious lineage, yet you also refer to your master as a "hag" and a "stubborn dimwit." Which of these descriptions is accurate?"Albedo could not help but ask this question - and when he did, Mona promptly realized that she had never given it much thought herself.Stroking her chin, she pondered this paradox deeply for a moment, before responding:"Hmph. The techniques passed down to me are exceptional, of course, but my teacher is not my equal.Does she know the market rates for eggs, butter, or wheat? In this regard, I have already far surpassed her."
During her apprenticeship, Mona found that the subtle abstractions of her master's teachings could explain the laws that governed the existence of all things.Human hearts were guided by these laws, and if one had great enough powers of calculation, all the mysteries of the world could be understood.Mona once believed this to be true.But when she had to strike out on her own and live day-to-day, she found herself doubting.Not everyone lived wealthy and comfortable lives. Some neither had food nor warm clothes, living no differently from beggars.And it was just such an adventurer who, when meeting Mona while she was out looking for fruits and vegetables to fill her stomach, shared half their food with her."Out here, we've gotta have each other's backs."This was not something inscribed on these so-called principles of the world. And many other such things she encountered on her journey - the honesty of a thief, a robber's change of heart, a coward's courage, the good deeds of a wicked person...Mona began to have some doubts, but she also felt like she finally had her feet on solid ground.When she was again alone with her thoughts under the stars, she marveled that her research had been so full of holes.Perhaps she would have to continue researching the world's principles for the rest of her life.
The Court of Fontaine's mainline newspaper, The Steambird, has many a featured section that contains all sorts of news and gossip drawn from every corner of the seven nations.The section Mona contributes to is known as "All Things Astrological," and it is a column specifically targeted at hobbyists and professionals. That she had this opportunity at all was pure chance.When the previous contributing author was traveling the world, he heard tell of a strange astrologist, and his hobbyist's curiosity compelled him to seek her out.Their correspondence left him deeply impressed.As it happened, he was also looking to retire, and seeing that Mona was strapped for Mora, reached out to help her by recommending her to the editor-in-chief of The Steambird.When Mona released her first column, "An Introduction to Astrology," the column, heretofore known for being easy reading, experienced a massive shift in tone.Most of each issue was dedicated to discussing the movement of celestial bodies and other difficult (and obscure) topics. Academic quotations, dense footnotes and even the occasional hand-drawn star maps abounded in these writings.The editor-in-chief could not help but feel worried that this approach was too academic. Would it find acceptance with long-time readers? As it turned out, there was no need to fret. The publishing house received a great many letters that read something like this:"Wow, this is amazing. I don't really get it, but this is super interesting. Consider me a fan of Astrologist Mona Megistus."After getting approval to continue submitting manuscripts, Mona could finally heave a sigh of relief.Now, how best to celebrate... Ah yes. Perhaps she should use her first paycheck to purchase that latest-edition planetarium she'd had her eye on for a while now...
To Mona, that her Vision was sent to her from the gods doesn't mean a great deal.This is not to say that possessing an external focus for elemental power is not useful.Having power is always a good thing, but when compared to lofty "truth," "martial prowess" is such a pathetically small concept.The gods, too, are bound by the rules of this world. Mona seeks the final truth of the world, hidden amidst the sea of stars.As such, she does not have any reverence for her Vision, which the people of this world consider to be a sign of divine favor and the source of all power.Nonetheless, this item that serves no practical use in her hands is something that she treasures greatly.It was gifted to her by her teacher as a teaching aid, and it is the only evidence of their time together as master and pupil.She preserves these distant memories with great care. This exquisitely-made teaching aid thus accompanied her everywhere, like an accessory worn by any other maiden.Until one day, when a Vision of her very own would quietly indwell this old teaching aid...

<title>Four Winds</title>
<text>The Four Winds are four entities that the Anemo Archon, Barbatos, entrusted the safety and protection of Mondstadt to before he disappeared a thousand years ago. They consist of the Wolf of the North, the Lion of the South, the Dragon of the East, and the Falcon of the West.YouTube: Breeze Amidst the Forest
Overview
As the four seasons in turn shall say their piece, so the four winds too shall never cease.
The Four Winds were officially established after Vennessa's rebellion against the Mondstadt Aristocracy a thousand years ago, Mondstadt's second liberation from tyranny, and the establishment of the Knights of Favonius. For roughly five hundred years, the people of Mondstadt worshipped the Four Winds and built temples dedicated to them.Temple of the Wolf
However, after the cataclysm, the worship of the Four Winds fell into decline, the temples were abandoned, and the people of Mondstadt eventually forgot about them almost entirely. As a result, conflicting information exists as to who exactly bears the titles of the Four Winds.
Dragon of the East
Dvalin, the Dragon of the East, is one of Barbatos' oldest allies and has been worshipped the longest out of the Four Winds. Although elemental dragons and gods have had a long history of conflict, Barbatos and Dvalin became friends after Barbatos taught his people not to fear Dvalin and taught the dragon human speech.Breeze Amidst the Forest
However, during the cataclysm five hundred years ago, Dvalin was badly injured from his battle against the demonic dragon Durin. He fell into slumber for five hundred years, only to awaken to a Mondstadt that had forgotten him and feared him. Believing himself abandoned by those he was sworn to protect, Dvalin rejected his position as Dragon of the EastA Long Shot Dvalin: Is this... the power of the Anemo Archon? But I am no longer part of the Four Winds. and began attacking Mondstadt, leading the people of Mondstadt to call him "Stormterror." Eventually, a group comprised of the Traveler, Paimon, Diluc, Jean, and Venti (Barbatos' mortal form) was able to save Dvalin from the Abyss Order's manipulations and clear up the misunderstanding between Mondstadt and the Dragon. While Dvalin no longer sees himself as one of the Four Winds, it seems that the people of Mondstadt have resumed their belief in him.Mysterious Islands: Journey to the Unknown Barbara: One of the Four Winds!?
While no Temple of the Dragon can be found in-game and Jean does not have the Knights of Favonius inspect Dvalin's respective temple, Diluc mentions an "East Temple of the Four Winds" when he relates a story about how the Fatui are seeking traces of Barbatos' power.State of the Holy Lyre der Himmel
Wolf of the North
The title of Wolf of the North has two possible bearers. The first is Lupus Boreas Andrius, the former God of Blizzards and King of the North Wind who now resides as a spirit in Wolvendom. Despite being long dead, his immense power allows him to manifest a temporary physical form composed of snow and ice for those who attempt his Wolf of the North Challenge. In 'Character Tales - "Venti: The Four Winds,"' Andrius is depicted as the Wolf of the North.
However, according to Breeze Amidst the Forest Supplement: The Dragon Tome, the title of Wolf of the North is given to the current title-bearer of the Knight of Boreas. Potential leaders of the Knights of Favonius are bestowed with either the title of "Lion" or "Wolf,"Favonius Sword although it is unclear if this tradition also designates the title-bearers of the Four Winds or whether the "Wolf" is necessarily the Knight of Boreas.
The Temple of the Wolf is located near the Thousand Winds Temple in Starfell Valley. It was originally a training ground. At some point, Andrius and his wolves moved westward and settled in Wolvendom.
Lion of the South
The Lion of the South is a unique position among the Four Winds, in that it is passed along down between the Grand Masters (and Acting Grand Masters) of the Knights of Favonius through the title of "Dandelion Knight" or "Lionfang Knight."Master's Day Off (Quest)
However, Favonius Sword's description states Grand Masters may bear the title of "Wolf" instead of "Lion," which puts the above information in question. It is also possible that the "Wolf" tradition became obsolete in the past five hundred years, and now only the "Lion" title is passed down to leaders of the Knights of Favonius.
It is said that dandelions represent the blessings of the Lion of the South.Temple of the Lion
The Temple of the Lion is located along Falcon Coast in Galesong Hill.
Falcon of the West
The title of Falcon of the West also has conflicting accounts as to who exactly holds it. Common belief is that after Vennessa ascended to Celestia, she became the Falcon of the West.Aquila Favonia In addition, even a vague, cryptic comment from Dainsleif, the only character in-game who mentions the Falcon of the West, suggests that the current Falcon of the West is Vennessa.During Bough Keeper: Dainsleif, Dainsleif says, "The Falcon of the West... though it can soar in the wind, it ultimately does naught but hover under the light of the gods..." Dainsleif does not indicate who he is talking about, but he does seem to be talking about an individual who is of a high enough standing to be compared to the gods. The only possible Falcon of the West who fits this description is Vennessa. However, according to Breeze Amidst the Forest, the entire Knights of Favonius are collectively the "Falcon."
The Temple of the Falcon is located at Windrise in Galesong Hill, between the City of Mondstadt and the massive oak tree where Vennessa is said to have ascended to godhood.

<title>Bathysmal Vishap</title>
<text>A mighty race of vishaps that dwell within the deep seas.That they hate light is not due to an overly fragile sense of sight. Instead, it is because they have had the selfless sunlight and the surface world taken from them that they refuse to countenance man-made light.
Bathysmal Vishaps, also known as the Dragonheir of the Depths Dragonheirs of the Depths, are a race of Vishaps found in Enkanomiya.
Pure, primordial elemental creatures, wild spirits who never bent the knee to any god or worldly power.The Subterranean Trials of Drake and Serpent
Bathysmal Vishaps have a special attack known as "Cleansing Shower", which drains a set amount of Energy if the attack hits. If the hit target does not have sufficient energy, they will lose HP.YouTube:: HoYoLAB:  This HP loss ignores shields, but can be negated using Elemental Burst Invincibility Frames i-frames.

Lore
The Bathysmal Vishaps are an intelligent and extremely adaptable race, capable of constant evolution to further suit the roles they desire much like ants. If a predecessor didn't have the ability to survive their new environment, their descendants would instead evolve the ability to survive the environment themselves, even possibly become attuned to certain elements. Vishap mothers can also create new seeds or traits to pass on to their descendants should they encounter unforeseen and challenging environments. Before encountering the people of Byakuyakoku, they had already stored a veritable armory within their bodies.The Byakuyakoku Collection They had even devolved their visual abilities due to their great hatred of humans.Dragonheir's False Fin
They are astonishingly intelligent species that have their own methods of communication amongst each other and have the ability to learn more and improve linguistic capacities. However, they are very aggressive towards humans. Not much of their social structure or religion is known but they, or all Vishaps, obey and follow their Seven Sovereigns Dragon Lords, seeing them as the peak of their kind.
One such lord for the Bathysmal Vishaps, is the Dragon of Water who would've been born from their kind had it not been for their impure evolutions. As a result, the new Dragon of Water was reborn as Neuvillette, who lost most of his memories and took on a human form.Bolteater Bathysmal Vishap Hatchling
Bathysmal Vishaps, or Vishaps in general, are beings of the Vishap or Light Realm and are elemental creatures, and are at odds with the Human Realm which Gods and Mortals inhabit, and the Void Realm.
After Neuvillette's Authority was restored, some of these vishaps began venturing to the surface, with one residing in Loch Urania. However, most Fontainians are not currently aware that Bathysmal Vishaps reside in Fontaine.Café Lutece Message Board The topic of the lecture at Salon Caritat this week After the tree in Erinnyes Forest was restored, another group of Bathysmal Vishaps surfaced around Loch Urania.</text>

<title>Liloupar</title>
<text>the character the gadget Jinni in the Magic Bottle — Liloupar
Liloupar, also spelled Liloufar, was a historical figure in the Great Red Sand and the Desert of Hadramaveth in Sumeru. She was a Jinni who originally served Nabu Malikata and after her death, served King Deshret. Liloupar is best known for her role in the destruction of Gurabad, which she wrought over three generations as revenge against her husband Ormazd, who became a tyrant after becoming the vassal king of the desert.
She appears, in bottle form, as part of the World Quest Series 'The Dirge of Bilqis'.
Profile
Like most Jinn, Liloupar is rather proud and only gives her allegiance to those whom she deems worthy. She takes the Traveler as her new master and, accordingly, holds the Eremites in low regard due to their attempts to use her for their own gain. Having previously had her soul split by King Deshret as punishment for the destruction she caused at Gurabad, she seeks to reclaim her fragments and restore her full power.
Appearance
Liloupar appears as a floating light bulb with a golden glow inside and with a purple cap on top.
Story
As a Jinni, Liloupar was said to have been born from the water lilies that grew from the streams which came into being from Nabu Malikata's footsteps. Like most other Jinn, she lived in Ay-Khanoum,Interactable: Nameless Tablet Nameless Tablet (V) Nameless Tablet (V) which Nabu Malikata and King Deshret jointly constructed for the Jinn. After Nabu Malikata's death, the Jinn turned to serve King Deshret,Defender of the Enchanting Dream who had promised them that their late mistress slumbered in the Orchard of Pairidaeza and that he would one day revive her.
The shepherd Ormazd, with King Deshret's grace and Liloupar's aid, united the desert peoples and defeated Huvashtra the Tyrant. Liloupar fell in love with him and believed he would be the one to realize Nabu Malikata's dream of a mortal society free of slavery.Interactable: Nameless Tablet Nameless Tablet (VI) Nameless Tablet (VI) However, Ormazd grew corrupt and tyrannical, much to Liloupar's fury. To take revenge on his "betrayal," Liloupar plotted to curse Gurabad with three generations of ruination, twisting her own children's fates to accomplish her goal.The First Days of the City of KingsDune-Entombed Fecundity: Part III
Liloupar gave birth to a daughter, Shirin. Before she delivered their daughter into Ormazd's hands, she prophesied three times: First, that Shirin would fall in love with a great hero and bear a child who would surpass their father, second, that many of her relatives would have a sweet end, and third, that she alone would be given her father's kingdom. The "great hero" whom Shirin married was her brother Parvezravan Kisra Parvez, Liloupar's son and Ormazd's adoptive son, but their marriage was a loveless one while Ormazd shunned her due to Liloupar's warnings to him; to quell her own fury, Shirin herself plotted revenge on Ormazd and Kisra. She assassinated Ormazd and her other siblings with poisoned honey, making Kisra the new ruler of Gurabad as "Parvezravan." Later, Shirin bore a son, Shiruyeh. Although she doted on him, Parvezravan feared his son due to Liloupar's prophecy and exiled Shiruyeh after he reached adulthood, which forced Shiruyeh to don a brass mask to disguise himself. Shirin eventually goaded her son into murdering Parvezravan and taking control of Gurabad.The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin
King Deshret punished Liloupar for the tragedy she caused at Gurabad and split the Jinni into seven parts.Vaguely-Readable Inscription: Primal Obelisk Safhe Shatranj Safhe Shatranj The most dominant part of Liloupar was kept in Liloupar's Cell. In some Eremite beliefs, it is said that Liloupar fell victim to an insidious plot and found herself with a "split soul."End of the Golden Realm
Present Day
During the events of 'The Dirge of Bilqis', the Traveler and Jeht uncover a magic bottle containing a fragment of Liloupar's soul. Liloupar, seeing some of Ormazd's original promising traits in the Traveler, takes them as her new master.The Temple Where Sand Flows Like Tears After obtaining her final soul fragment, Liloupar leaves to reunite with her children in Gurabad. The bottle is left behind with the Traveler and still provides the same benefit as when Liloupar inhabited it.Memories of Gurabad</text>

<title>Dark Sea</title>
<text>The Dark Sea is a term that refers to any location beyond the continent of Teyvat. Because they are not within Teyvat's boundaries, those who dwell there do not live under the dominion of The Seven.
Overview
Little is known about this area besides the fact that it is outside of Teyvat. Despite being called a "sea," this term also encompasses landmasses.Bit of Aerosiderite
In the ancient past, parts of the land now known as the Dark Sea were inhabited by the Seelie, who built palaces there. While some Seelie also dwell in Teyvat, their palaces are said to stand in the "wasteland" beyond the dominion of The Seven, which is "inhabited only by the grotesque ghostly remains of fallen gods."A Drunkard's Tale
Following the end of the Archon War 2,000 years ago, many of the defeated gods who survived chose to flee to the Dark Sea instead of living under the new order of The Seven. However, it is suggested that the gods who fled have also died since then from reasons unknown.
Enkanomiya is referred to as part of the Dark SeaJade Branch of a Distant Sea (despite being directly below Watatsumi Island and thus geographically within Teyvat's borders), as it is outside of the jurisdiction of The Seven.  The "serpent god" Orobashi was worshipped by the people of Enkanomiya after saving the inhabitants from the Dragonheir of the Depths Dragonheirs of the Depths. Derived from information within the book 'Before Sun and Moon', Enkanomiya's history extends to long before the dominion of The Seven, supposedly to a time when The Seven did not exist and "all of humanity was unified under a single culture."Eboshi After Orobashi discovered this book and the secrets detailed within, he was sentenced to death by Celestia, presumably because Celestia does not want anyone to know that Celestia and the gods do not originate from Teyvat.
There may be other areas that meet the requirements of being labelled as the "Dark Sea," such as the Golden Apple Archipelago Haar Islands or Khaenri'ah, but they are never directly referred to as part of the Dark Sea.
Known Gods
The following gods are known to have fled to the Dark Sea at some point in time.
Name !! Original Nation !! Status
Orobashi || ? || Deceased; returned from Enkanomiya to Teyvat and became the god of the Sangonomiya Clan and Watatsumi Island before fighting and being slain by Ei.
Notes
* In A Drunkard's Tale (III), which makes reference to the Seelies and the wasteland "beyond the dominion of the deities," the original Chinese text is clearer that "deities" refers to The Seven, while "gods" refers to gods who preceded The Seven.</text>

<title>Focalors</title>
<text>the Hydro Archon the playable character Furina
Focalors was the God of Justice and the former Hydro Archon among The Seven who presided over Fontaine. She is the successor of Egeria, and was originally one of Egeria's Oceanid familiars.
As of Masquerade of the Guilty, she was sentenced to death by the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale and willingly gave up her full elemental authority to Neuvillette. This sentence exacted by the Oratrice also effectively abolished the Divine Throne of the Hydro Archon altogether, making Focalors the last Hydro Archon.
Once one with the being known as Furina, she separated her "divinity" from this singular body to exist separately as Focalors, with the remaining "humanity" made into Furina. After her death, Furina now continues to live autonomously as an ordinary human.
Profile
Introduction
My ideals have no stains.I must correct you. People here bear no sins in the eyes of the gods... Only laws and the Tribunal can judge someone.They can judge even me. So praise my magnificence and purity.|Focalors
Appearance
Focalors is a fair-skinned woman with Heterochromia iridum heterochromic eyes, her right eye being light blue and her left eye dark blue. Like Furina, her hair is of a whitish-blue tinge with light blue streaks, and is divided into two parts: a short bell-shaped bob that goes to her neck, and two longer strands of hair that go down to her waist.
Focalors wears a white dress with puffy long sleeves and gold accents, that fades to a dark shade of blue with starry details towards the hems and ends of her sleeves. The bodice of her dress is dark blue fading to white, with gold accents and trims; the center exposes portions of her chest and stomach, and is fastened by gold and blue metal details. She is barefoot, and wears a gold ankle cuff with a blue jewel on her left ankle. Her fingernails and toenails are painted with light blue nail polish.
Personality
Because Focalors and Furina are two aspects of a once singular being, their personality and interests are similar. She shares Furina's passion for drama and her fascination with grand displays of human emotion, but does not display any of Furina's emotional outbursts as those stem from her humanity that now resides entirely within Furina.
Story
History
Egeria, the previous Hydro Archon, was slain during the cataclysm,Vibrant Pinion and Focalors was instated in her place as the Hydro Archon sometime afterward. Focalors herself was also an Oceanid who Egeria decided to be her successor when the time came.  The Oceanids that did not assume a human form, including the strongest among them, Rhodeia of Loch, did not recognize Focalors as the new Hydro Archon,Life Flows On (II) with Idyia noting that around the same time as her ascension, the very waters of Fontaine became filled with pain and hatred.Idyia This change, in addition to their discovery of what remained of their former god at the Harvisptokhm,Pale Fire (Quest) led the Oceanids to exile themselves from Fontaine and cut all ties.
Upon ascending, Focalors separated her divinity from her body and spirit; and named the human she left behind "Furina." Focalors saw Furina as essentially a human version of herself as well as exactly the kind of human she wished to be. Focalors kept her Gnosis in her divine half and hid inside the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale, while tasking Furina with taking her place to deceive the masses in order to carry out her plan, as if her identity was revealed, her plan would fail and the Prophecy of Fontaine prophecy would doom her people. To ensure this, Focalors placed a curse upon Furina, making her immortal as long as her divinity existed, but also preventing her from pursuing her own happiness. Furina was successful in duping the masses for 500 years, during which she used the acquired Indemnitium to forge a massive sword that she would use to kill her divinity with.
Archon Quests
The current Seven are all briefly mentioned in the Downtown while Zhongli is inspecting the kites that represent them. Of the God of Justice's kite, he says '"Justice flows across the surface of the waters."'
In the A Toast to Victory, Nahida mentions that while Focalors doesn't directly preside over trials, she is still present and has the right to influence the final verdict. Focalors created the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale, which was designed and meant to help the Iudex, Neuvillette, carry out sentences.
During Lyney's first show at the Opera Epiclese, he went to investigate the Oratrice under the guise of performing a magic trick. While in the room where the Oratrice's core was held, Lyney heard a voice, which caused him to retreat. He confessed this fact to the Traveler during his trial for murder,Lies Cast Shadows Under Gathered Lights who would later pass on the information to Neuvillette.When All Return to the Waters Unbeknownst to any of the parties involved, this voice was Focalors'.
Following Tartaglia Childe's disappearance in the Fortress of Meropide, The Knave Arlecchino decided to investigate Furina, eventually running into her by pure chance while she was trying to play with a cat, using the opportunity to attack and try to steal her Gnosis. She did not find the Gnosis on her, while Furina was left shocked and begged for mercy. Arlecchino felt a "curse" of some sort emanating from her, her genuine fear of death and eccentric behavior unfitting for an Archon. Arlecchino left without threatening any further harm, realizing that she was not Focalors and that the Gnosis was being held somewhere else.Calamitous Tread
Eventually, Focalors would be put on trial for the "original sin" that the Heavenly Principles had declared on Egeria. The Traveler and Neuvillette would eventually realize that Furina was a fraud, managing to put her on trial in an attempt to make her reveal her secrets as to avoid the prophecy. Now revealing her true identity, Focalors appeared to Neuvillette and admitted to having Furina take her place as the Hydro Archon for the past 500 years in order to successfully deceive the Heavenly Principles. She then reveals her plan to end herself at the hands of the Oratrice, thus returning her elemental authority to its rightful owner, Neuvillette, both out of guilt from acquiring his stolen power, and knowing that only him at his full dragonhood and the experiences he had with the people, would be able to save them from the prophecy. Having acquired enough Indemnitium to carry out her sentence, she proceeded to execute herself. Her Gnosis was returned to Neuvillette; with his full Authority restored, he proceeded to absolve Fontanians of their sin, preventing them from dissolving, though any that dissolved prior to her sacrifice would not be returned. This self-sacrifice also shattered her Archon throne, resulting in six Archons remaining.The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur

<title>Kshahrewar</title>
<text>Kshahrewar is one of the Sumeru Akademiya The Six Darshans Six Darshans, the six main schools of Sumeru Akademiya.A Muddy Bizarre Adventure (Part 2)
It is specialized in technology,Opening Festivities and includes related disciplines such as architecture and puzzle-solving.Sitt
Its school color is white. The mascot on its symbol resembles a lion.
Overview
Many of the buildings and structures found in Sumeru City were created or improved upon by Kshahrewar scholars. In particular, their design for Building Block of the City of Wisdom a simple single-story building has become somewhat of a template for many of the city's buildings, especially due to the low cost and adaptability. Though the effects of their technological advances are widespread and have led to more affordable products, most people are unable to appreciate or even notice the complex theory that goes into it.Commerce of the City of WisdomThe Twisting Mist
Kshahrewar researchers are also instrumental to Sumeru's textile industry, particularly due to their loom designs.Woven LengthWoven Depth Over the past one hundred years, they have worked towards making textile machines more productive, while still allowing the fabric to retain its beauty.Musing Tawny Tapestry
Pir Kavikavus was one of the greatest scholars in Kshahrewar's history; however, an accident occurred while he investigated Devantaka Mountain's Ruin Golem (Devantaka Mountain) Ruin Golem and his research was lost. Ever since then, the school has gone downhill. Likely due to the accident, Kshahrewar advocated for strict control of machines and technology.Akademiya Public Message Board Funding for Kshahrewar There were no more major academic breakthroughs, and the school remains underfunded.Vimana Agama: Jazari's ChapterUntil Vana is Healed Nowadays, Kshahrewar is only kept afloat by long-term funding from Dori, who supplies them with Mora in exchange for their technology and craftsmanship.
In the past 100 years, Kshahrewar has used Faruzan Faruzan's academic discourse and manuscripts as the foundation for their mechanical research. As a result, once Faruzan returned to teaching in the Akademiya, Kshahrewar researchers have eagerly attempted to recruit her from Haravatat to become a professor in their Darshan, offering her a higher spending limit to conduct her research with and more students in exchange, but without success. However, in recent years, Kshahrewar has begun to develop their own mechanisms theories, making Faruzan's teachings increasingly niche even in their Darshan.A Mysterious Senior...?
Kshahrewar is also in charge of researching King Deshret's technology, though it has yet to be fully understood by them, and their current theories cannot explain the mysteries surrounding it, leading to a wide range of opinions on the subject. Kaveh, a Kshahrewar alumnus, was particularly interested in the subject, and his curiosity led him to purchase a machine core excavated from the ruins of King Deshret's civilization, which he eventually used to build an Mehrak automated case that runs on a modified version of the core.Competition on the Sands</text>

<title>Water</title>
<text>the Environmental Hazard the element Hydro
Water is a ubiquitous Environmental Hazard that allows for a variety of movement through and on top of it. When touching the water, any character will get the Hydro Wet status. Water can usually be Frozen by attacking the surface with Cryo (the duration of which varies on the method that produced the ice).
It is possible to Diving swim underwater in Fontaine's waters.
Movement
There are various forms of movement that can be used to traverse water:
Normal Traversal
Shallow water can be normally traversed, only applying the Wet status.
Waist deep water forces the character to wade through the water: sprinting and dashing are disabled, but running, walking, and jumping are unaffected. The depth of water that characters can wade through is based on the characters' heights.
Swimming
When the current character can no longer touch the floor of the body of water, the character will start to Swimming swim. Actively swimming in any direction will consume stamina. Treading water will not consume stamina but will also not allow stamina to recharge naturally (certain foods can be consumed to replenish stamina). In this state, the player cannot switch their active character.
The player can sacrifice stamina inefficiently to swim faster using a front crawl method.
If the player runs out of stamina while swimming, the active character will go through a drowning animation and be teleported back to the location they were standing or the location their stamina was last at full capacity. All party members will proceed to lose 5% of their health and all energy should this occur. It is possible to drown in shallower water, but this is usually as a result of poor ping.
Swimming in Fontaine
In Fontaine, when players have the blessing of the Transoceanic Sourcewater, swimming will not consume Stamina but Aquatic Stamina. Unlike regular Stamina, Aquatic Stamina can be recharged while the character is floating still, like on the surface. When Aquatic Stamina is expended, the character will not drown.
Players can enter Diving mode by pressing the crouch control (Left Ctrl by default on PC) while swimming in deep water. If attempting to dive in shallow water, an Error message "Too shallow to dive here" will appear.
Water Traversing Talents
These are talents that allow the character to traverse over the surface of water (without directly freezing it).
Alternate Sprints
Certain character talents, like Mona's Illusory Torrent and Kamisato Ayaka's Kamisato Art: Senho, alter the characters' sprint. These special sprints allow them to efficiently travel over the surface of water while they have stamina.
Canceling this sprint will cause the character to exit their sprint animation and apply sprint effects. For instance, Kamisato Ayaka applies Cryo to water (see  Combat). Otherwise, they will drop into the water and transition to a swimming animation.
If the character has no more stamina left, the character will automatically exit the sprint and can still drown.
Waverider
Waverider
This waterborne vehicle allows for travel through bodies of water that is connected to a Waverider Waypoint. It was introduced in the Golden Apple Archipelago 1.6 Golden Apple Archipelago in Version 1.6, along with hazards like the whirlpools, bodies of fog, and water events like mist bubbles.
Element Interactions
Applying various elements to water can cause various reactions:
* Cryo - Causes a sheet of ice to form in the approximate shape of the damage area. Depending on the source of the Cryo application, the sheet of ice will last a certain amount of time before melting away. All characters and enemies can stand on top of this sheet of ice as if it were land. The sheet of ice behaves like a Frozen object and can therefore affect or be affected by additional mechanics and elements.
** The Frozen water's duration is determined by the amount of Cryo gauge units that an ability applies. Frozen water duration is calculated as:\text{Frozen Water Duration (Seconds)} = \min(\text{Gauge}_\text{Cryo Attack}, 3.2) \times 2.5
*** Therefore, 1U Cryo attacks freeze water for 2.5s, 2U Cryo attacks freeze water for 5s, and 4U Cryo attacks (currently exclusive to Kaeya's Frostgnaw) freeze water for 8s.
** Some talents with Elemental Absorption, such as Palm Vortex, may absorb Cryo from the ice and therefore deal Cryo DMG, which can cause more ice to appear. This ice is considered separate from the original ice despite appearing to "extend" the original ice.
** Electro - Causes a non-damaging Superconduct reaction that shortens the time until the ice melts.
** Pyro - Causes a Melt reaction that immediately melts the ice. Characters and enemies who were on top of the ice will immediately drop into the water, except for the enemies that can walk on water such as Hydro Slimes.
* Electro - Causes the area to be electrified for a short amount of time, dealing Electro DMG over time to characters, enemies, and wildlife in the area.
* Pyro - Causes a visual Vaporize reaction (water vapors appear).
Water also applies Wet on contact, which may cause certain reactions:
* Cryo - Characters and enemies who are already affected by Cryo will become frozen upon touching water.
* Electro - Characters and enemies who are already affected by Electro will not become Electro-Charged upon touching water. Instead, the Hydro and Electro auras will coexist.
* Pyro - Characters and enemies who are already affected by Pyro will have a Vaporize reaction occur. This does not deal DMG.
* Dendro - Characters and enemies who are already affected by Dendro will have a Bloom reaction occur.
If the water is deep enough to the enemy's height, they will drown, instantly killing them and generally placing their loot on the last safe location they were on. Heavier enemies, while not being Displacement displaced as easily, can still be manipulated into drowning by luring them across frozen water and then letting the ice melt.
Water is also a Hydro object, which allows it to serve as a source for Elemental Absorptions.
Special Bodies of Water
Decorative Water
Fountains, waterfalls and various other bodies of decorative water in Main City Main Cities cannot be Frozen, nor will they become Electro-Charged when in contact with Electro. The same is the case for the water in the realm layout Silken Courtyard, and the water in various Furnishings.
Waterfalls will force characters caught in them downwards, making climbing difficult, if not impossible. Repeatedly opening one's Wind Glider will slow one's fall when caught in a waterfall.
Waterfalls that fall through air and not against a cliff face, such as many of the waterfalls in Watatsumi Island, will not apply the Wet effect to characters.
Damaging Water
Damaging water is too dangerous to swim through. This include water with spikes (found in 'Crash Course') and electrified water. When inside damaging water, the active character will lose large amounts of HP at a time, dying in approximately 6–8 seconds.
Electrified Water
Certain bodies of water in Inazuma are energized with Electro. Coming into contact with Electrified WaterFallen Character Game Over Screen by swimming or standing in it will make the active character Wet but will not apply Electro to them, and the active character will Health HP Loss lose HP, even if they are only standing in shallow Electrified Water. As is the case with other environmental hazards in Inazuma, carrying an Electrogranum is recommended, as it blocks some of the HP loss from coming into contact with Electrified Water.
The HP loss inflicted by Electrified Water is calculated as (0.0315 \times \text{Increase Factor} + 0.1) \times \text{Max HP} + 20.47 \times \text{Increase Factor} + 20.
HP loss is inflicted every 2 seconds. 'Increase Factor' starts at 1, increases by 1 every time a character suffers HP loss from Electrified Water, and caps out at 6. It will be reset to 1 every time the active character leaves Electrified Water (including switching to another party member).
While these bodies of water are similar to areas affected by Balethunder and are sometimes found in Balethunder-affected areas, they are not the same. The Balethunder climate icon will not appear next to the minimap even while swimming in Electrified Water if the rest of the area is not affected by Balethunder, and dying due to Electrified Water will not award the Shocking... Positively Shocking. Similarly, completing Tatara Tales clears the Balethunder in Tatarasuna but the Electrified Water will remain.
Electrified Water cannot be Electro-Charged or Frozen. However, despite the lack of ice, Cryo Slimes can bounce on top of Electrified Water and will not drown.
* Cryo DMG that contacts Electrified Water causes Superconduct, dealing AoE Cryo DMG.
* Pyro that contacts Electrified Water will cause Overloaded.
Electrified Water can be found in the following locations:</text>

<title>Beret Society</title>
<text>The Beret Society was a network of prisoners in the Fortress of Meropide.
Overview
Dougier founded the Beret Society. His motivation was that it was easy for prisoners to feel lonely in Meropide, so he established an organization to help people turn a new leaf and live more happy lives.The Proud "Beret Society"
Wriothesley helped Dougier establish the society by rubber stamping the application. Wriothesley first introduces the society as model prisoners.An Opportunity for Rebirth
The society gathers in the Fortress of Meropide near the Coupon Cafeteria. Drinks, snacks, books, and other resources can be found at their gatherings. They also host other activities and seminars that are popular and well-attended. As not everybody takes their sentences seriously, the society provides an outlet where prisoners can chill out, relax, and start a new life.
Dougier says that members look out for each other and remind each other of their goals. People can improve their mental states and make new friends.
The society is funded by members' donated goods and Credit Coupons.
Members wear hats (berets) as Dougier felt they needed a kind of "visible identifier" and a point of pride, so that people could feel a sense of shared community. He hopes people show optimism, community, hard work, and a desire to create a new life and that the hats represent a common goal the society works towards. The hat also represents a "model citizen" and helps the society recruit new members.
In reality, the berets were meant to hide a special thorn filled with dark liquid known as Aqua Doloris (Latin: "Water of Pain")It's What He Deserves in their heads, which was a highly concentrated form of "fear" that was injected into their brains by said thorn. Dougier saw how comfortable Wriothesley lived by using the prison workforce as labor and what he believed was that everyone had been convicted of a crime and that he did not care about their well-being, seeking such luxury for himself. Using the liquid and thorns, he controlled everyone with an iron fist, punishing and torturing those who broke the true rules of the society. He also acquired a large force of the prison's Gardemeks by stealing them through "disappearances" or decommission orders, which he intended to use as muscle to overthrow Wriothesley's control of the prison.
The true rules of the society were:
* Members were not to speak with each other without permission.
* Members were not to leave without formal permission.
* Groups would be formed by five members, and all would be punished even if only one of them was responsible for the wrongdoing.
* A member who reported another for misbehavior would be rewarded with food and water.
* Members were to obey Dougier's orders.
Breaking a rule would result in a punishment known as "censure", where the punished would have the thorn filled with liquid and injected into their head to remind them of the fear of breaking Dougier's rules. They had to take the punishment while conscious, though there were other unmentioned fourth-degree or higher punishments.
However, Wriothesley and the Traveler discovered the plot and put a stop to Dougier's plans. With his apprehension, the society was disbanded.</text>

Lore
The Sacred Sakura is a tree that represents the power of the Electro Archon. Its roots have spread extensively throughout Inazuma, and the Thunder Sakura were grafted from its side branches. The Sacred Sakura and the Thunder Sakura remove evil and purify the land by absorbing filth into its roots. However, the accumulated filth in the roots does not dissipate on its own, so it is necessary to routinely perform a Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual Lore Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual to purify the filth.World Quest Series: Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual
The Sacred Sakura grew from a seed given from Makoto to Ei after Ei's present-day duel against the Shogun within Makoto's Realm of Consciousness realm of consciousness. Having been unable to slowly ease Ei into the role of Electro Archon before her death in Khaenri'ah during the cataclysm 500 years ago, Makoto inserted a portion of her consciousness into the Musou Isshin, waiting for the day Ei could draw on its power and release her consciousness. Within this realm, the seed Ei planted retroactively took root in Inazuma's past, allowing it to grow so it could protect Inazuma while Ei eased into her role naturally. Ei speculates that Makoto's plan involved a "higher power," Istaroth.Radiant Sakura</text>

<title>Waverider</title>
<text>The Waverider is a boat mechanic that players can use to traverse over water. It can be summoned from any active Waverider Waypoint. When the player is not inside, it is marked on the map with Waverider Map 25.
Overview
While riding it, the player can use two types of weapons: the Swiftstrike and Heavy Cannons. The Swiftstrike, which replaces the player's Normal Attack, has a 1-second cooldown and deals 100% ATK as Physical DMG when fired. The Heavy Cannon, which replaces the player's Elemental Skill, launches a bomb that explodes dealing 200% ATK as AoE Physical DMG. It has a 15-second cooldown. Both attacks can be used to damage enemies and take down certain submerged Hilichurl Structures.
The player can also speed up the boat to consume an amount of engine stamina. Its stamina is independent of the player's stamina. Stamina regeneration is also independent; the Waverider's stamina will continue to regenerate even when the player is not riding it, and the player's stamina will continue to regenerate while riding the Waverider. If the stamina is fully depleted, it will not cause death; the Waverider can continue to move at a normal speed, similar to what happens when the player runs out of stamina while sprinting on land.
The Waverider will have a certain level and amount of HP (e.g., Lv. 90 with 42821 HP). Using the Waverider Repair Toolbox gadget will restore 50% of its HP. If the Waverider reaches 0 HP, the player will be ejected from it. The player can also self-eject by holding the spacebar. When the Waverider is not taking damage, once every 2 seconds, it will heal 5% Max HP if a player is inside or 0.65% Max HP if empty.
The player cannot take damage while inside the Waverider, including from Ley Line Disorders. Only the Waverider can be destroyed.
Ejecting from the Waverider will cause the player to shoot into the sky while gliding.
While sailing, if one steers too far off course into the fog, they will automatically return to the last activated Glimmering Beacon.

<title>Orobashi</title>
<text>Orobashi no Mikoto ja=オロバシノミコト sort=jaJade Branch of a Distant Sea or Orobaxi zh=奥罗巴斯,The term translated into English as "Orobashi" zh-Hans=远吕羽氏 zh-Hant=遠呂羽氏 ja=オロバシ 遠呂羽氏 sort=zh-Hans,zh-Hant,ja, has the same meaning in both Chinese and Japanese but is read as 'Yuǎnlǚyǔshì' in Chinese and 'Orobashi' in Japanese. As a result, most NPCs use "Orobaxi" zh=奥罗巴斯 zh_rm=Àoluóbāsī, which is a Chinese phonetic spelling for the Japanese 'Orobashi' reading. Because most other localizations translate 远吕羽氏 as 'Orobashi', the reason for a phonetic spelling is lost; the Japanese localization does not even bother distinguishing the two names and translate them both as オロバシ. also referred to as the Watatsumi Omikami ja=海祇大御神, was an ancient dragon-like serpent god that was defeated by Ei at Yashiori Island. The Musoujin Gorge is the scar left by the god when she delivered a blow from her Musou no Hitotachi, slaying the serpent.
The remnants of Orobashi can be seen throughout both Inazuma and Enkanomiya, with its skull located at Serpent's Head. Its lingering power has resulted in the Tatarigami, a phenomenon on the island that causes natural disasters and can drive people on the island mad.
The residents of Watatsumi Island and their leaders, the Sangonomiya Clan, worship Orobashi, as it taught them how to farm and smelt after discovering them in the Dark Sea (referring to Enkanomiya). Therefore, the people of Watatsumi Island are very grateful towards Orobashi and worship it as their guardian deity.Miyazaki Saburou
Appearance
According to legends, Orobashi had a fluorescent body covered in myriad-colored coral.Coral Branch of a Distant Sea
Story
Early Archon War
Orobashi was born some time before or during the Archon War. Unable to defeat either Morax Deus AuriThe original Chinese text of "the golden god" mentioned in Oathsworn Eye is 贵金之神 tl=God of Expensive Gold, which is the same character as "Deus Auri" in Neuvillette's Voice-Over Neuvillette Voice-Overs About the Geo Archon about the Geo Archon. Additionally, German, French, Indonesian, and Vietnamese localization of "the golden god" also changed to Deus Auri in Version 4.2. or Ei (representing the Raiden Shogun), and tired of "being shamed for blasphemy",Oathsworn Eye Orobashi fled from TeyvatA Preliminary Study of Sangonomiya Folk BeliefThe Serpent and Drakes of Tokoyokoku and eventually ended up beyond the seal that separated Enkanomiya from Teyvat.The Byakuyakoku Collection
In Enkanomiya
Orobashi remained confined in a cavern for untold ages, until a child of Enkanomiya who was exploring beyond the region's three corners discovered it. The child asked it to become their god, and Orobashi agreed. This ended the rule of the Sunchildren and their corrupt puppeteers as well as reduced the threat of the Bathysmal Vishaps. The ancient people of Enkanomiya co-worshipped Orobashi, the coral serpent, with Ouroboros, the scaleless imaginary serpent.The Byakuyakoku Collection Its influence led to the end of the worship of the Dainichi Mikoshi and many of the corrupt practices established by the Sunchildren regime.
Orobashi brought with its newfound rule drastic changes to Enkanomiya society, including changing from the ancient Watatsumi language to the Narukami-style language.The Byakuyakoku Collection Following a certain prophecy, it prepared the people of Enkanomiya to return to the surface and helped acclimate them to Narukami and Inazuman conventions.
However, in taking in these forgotten people and learning of their history, Orobashi came upon the book 'Before Sun and Moon', which recorded a history of the world that Celestia wanted concealed: One that recorded the existence of an "old world" and the Seven Sovereigns, the Sovereigns' defeat and the creation of a new world at the hands of the Primordial One and its four shining shades, and the war against the Second Who Came during which Enkanomiya sank into the depths of the ocean. For this knowledge, both Orobashi and Watatsumi as a whole were found guilty of four counts of profanity and eight counts of deceiving living souls. Orobashi was allowed to take all of their transgressions on itself and sacrifice itself so its people would be spared and taken under the rule of Celestia once again.The Subterranean Trials of Drake and Serpent
At some point in time, presumably after reading 'Before Sun and Moon', Orobashi personally led experiments on the Dragonheir of the Depths Dragonheirs of the Depths to better understand their abilities, and to breed Vishaps capable of growing Bloodbranch Coral.
Return to Teyvat and Death
Under the guise of guiding its people back to the surface, Orobashi broke off the coral that grew from its body-a manifestation of its power-to create Watatsumi Island so the people of Enkanomiya had a new home.Sangonomiya Chronicles There, Orobashi taught them how to farm and smelt, for which they were deeply grateful and worshipped it. It lived among its people for some time before finally meeting its end towards the end of the Archon War 2,000 years ago.Rift Valley, Yashiori IslandThose Who Yearn for the Gods' Gaze
By that point, the Inazuman archipelagos were united under Makoto's rule, with her twin sister Ei acting as her kagemusha (body double). All those who dwelt within Inazuma were content with their lot and did not seek to take what was not theirs, lest they be eradicated by the Raiden Shogun. When the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual was developed, those performing the ritual were to beg forgiveness from both the Narukami and the Watatsumi shrines before beginning the ritual,Sacred Sakura Cleansing Summary suggesting that Orobashi may have been worshipped by people from other islands for a time.
By the time of Orobashi's death, Watatsumi Island was already plagued with woes unrelated to their knowledge of forbidden history. The island was ill-suited for growing crops due to its geological structure, leading to starvation and disease. The Watatsumi people pleaded to conquer the more resource-rich Yashiori Island to make up for their own deficiencies, but Orobashi refused time and time again, knowing how the Raiden Shogun had slain the opposing gods in Inazuma over the course of the Archon War. However, between the cries of his people and the decree from Celestia, Orobashi was left with no other choice.
Orobashi built up a navy, led by the shrine maiden Mouun and her twin sister Ayame, and invaded Yashiori Island. They succeeded in conquering it, and Mouun's disciple Touzannou (later known as Akuou) was named the vassal ruler of the island.The Life of Mouun the Shrine Maiden After hearing word of the attack, Ei gathered her troops and waged a brutal war against Watatsumi. The war caused great suffering and many casualties on both sides, including Ei's lieutenant Sasayuri.
Towards the end of the war, Orobashi was slain by Ei using her signature Musou no Hitotachi swordsmanship, dying with its gaze fixed upon the heavens. The killing blow created a great rift known as Musoujin Gorge that split the island in two, while Orobashi's remains were left to rest throughout the island.Official Genshin Impact Website, Inazuma Travel Highlights:  Touzannou was also slain by this slash,Debates on the "Viceroy of the East" while Mouun was ambushed and slain by Sasayuri's troops as she attempted a retreat. Ayame went missing in action, with no consensus as to her ultimate fate.
Legacy
With Orobashi's death, its lingering power became the Tatarigami, which the Shogunate later utilized to create the Mikage Furnace.Tatara Tales (Quest) The main shrine on Watatsumi Island was subsequently abandoned, with a new shrine being built elsewhere, and the Divine Priestess took leadership over the island. While the true reason for Orobashi's death was to be kept secret, rumors still exist that Celestia ordered its death. However, the most commonly accepted theory is that Orobashi attacked Yashiori Island for its resources.
According to Sangonomiya Chronicles, a text written by Shogunate historian Kujou Michizane, the people of Sangonomiya have recognized the Inazuma Shogunate as the rightful ruler following the death of the Great Serpent. However, while recognizing the Raiden Shogun's authority, the people of Sangonomiya have continued to worship Orobashi instead of the Raiden Shogun despite its death at her hands.Official Genshin Impact Website, Inazuma Travel Highlights: 'There will always be an irreconcilable conflict between the people of Narukami who believe in the Raiden Shogun and the people of Sangonomiya who believe in Watatsumi Omikami. The strife between both parties has only worsened since the Vision Hunt Decree was enforced.' According to the Shogun, the people of Watatsumi were allowed to continue worshipping Orobashi so that it may continue receiving their prayers.
When the Vision Hunt Decree was enacted, the Sangonomiya Clan declared war on the Inazuma Shogunate, leading to mass skirmishes between the Watatsumi Army and the Tenryou Commission. While the Decree was the main motivator for the war, the preexisting tensions between the Shogunate and Watatsumi Island affected the actions of several members of the Watatsumi Army during the war. A radical faction within the resistance, at Nathan's suggestion, sought to revive Orobashi by destroying the Narukami Pillars on Yashiori Island.Interactable: Serpent's Head Waterlogged Note Waterlogged Note Unbeknownst to them, Nathan was a Fatui mole sent to sabotage the war effort by releasing the Tatarigami and hindering the resistance's chances at a quick victory.
Following the revelation of the Fatui conspiracy and the end of the Vision Hunt Decree, most of the Fatui withdrew from the island, save for a few who wished to get payback for Signora's death. Nonetheless, some Watatsumi residents find it hard to accept peace with the Shogunate, believing that doing so would mean that Orobashi's sacrifice was in vain.

<title>Shield</title>
<text>Shields are protective barriers that block damage to characters or enemies. Player character shields work differently from enemy shields. Below mostly discusses character shields. Enemy shields and breaking them are discussed in Shields Enemy and Shields Shield Gauge Data.
Character Shields
Characters can gain shields through the Crystallize Elemental Reaction or by using certain Talents or Weapons.
These shields have a set amount of health determined when the shield is created; when the active character takes damage, damage is dealt to shield health first, and any excess damage after breaking the shield is dealt to the character's health.
Shields often have intrinsic damage absorption bonuses that increase the amount of damage absorbed by each shield health point (usually against certain types of elemental damage).
Most shields gained by characters have a corresponding Element. Such elemental shields will have absorption bonuses against DMG of specific types: Geo shields gain 150% absorption bonus to all DMG types, while all other elemental shields gain 250% absorption bonus to their own element.
When a character has more than one shield, the damage dealt by an enemy will affect every active shield simultaneously.HoYoverse News:
Crystallize Shields
Crystallize
Shields gained from picking up the Elemental Shards dropped by Crystallize reactions have shield health based on the level and Elemental Mastery of the character that triggered the reaction. These shields additionally have 250% effectiveness against elemental damage of the same element; in other words, they only take 40% as much damage when absorbing damage of their own element.
\text{HP}_\text{Crystallize Shield} = \text{HP}_\text{Base Crystallize Shield} \times (1 + \% \text{ EM Bonus})
Base Crystallize Shield HP is only affected by the character level. For level scaling and other details, see Crystallize.
When the shield takes damage, the damage is scaled down based on the shield's elemental damage absorption bonuses and the active character's Attributes Shield Strength Shield Strength attribute.
\text{DMG Taken}_\text{Crystallize Shield} = \frac{\text{DMG Incoming}}{(\% \text{Element Bonus}) \times (1 + \% \text{Shield Strength}_\text{Active Character})}
If the damage exceeds the shield's health, the damage taken by character is the excess damage multiplied by the same shield bonus multipliers:
\text{DMG Taken}_\text{Excess} = \text{DMG}_\text{Incoming Excess} \times (\% \text{Element Bonus}) \times (1 + \% \text{Shield Strength}_\text{Active Character})
Talent Shields
Shields created by Talents and Constellations usually have health based on the character's DEF or Max HP.
Shield damage is scaled down by any elemental damage absorption bonuses and the active character's Attributes Shield Strength Shield Strength attribute. Some character Talents and Constellations may grant additional damage absorption bonuses to shields generated by the character; these apply multiplicatively.NGA:
\text{HP}_\text{Talent Shield} = \text{Stat} \times (\% \text{Talent Multiplier}) + \text{Additive Shield HP}
The damage taken on talent shields is therefore:
\text{DMG Taken}_\text{Talent Shield} = \frac{\text{DMG Incoming}}{( \% \text{Element Bonus}) \times (1 + \% \text{ Shield Strength}_\text{Active Character})}
If the damage exceeds the shield's health, the damage taken by character is the excess damage multiplied by the same shield bonus multipliers:
\text{DMG Taken}_\text{Excess} = \text{DMG}_\text{Incoming Excess} \times (\% \text{Element Bonus}) \times (1 + \% \text{ Shield Strength}_\text{Active Character})
See Shields Comparison for a comparison of character shield strength, duration and cooldown.

Shields/Enemy
Certain enemies also have shields that prevent or reduce damage, or grant them the ability to use certain attacks, but their mechanics differ from player shields.
Instead of functioning as an extra health bar (with additional damage absorption bonuses), enemy shields are usually based on elemental gauges.

<title>Hydro</title>
<text>Hydro is one of the seven Elements.
Its associated Archon was Focalors, whose domain was Fontaine.
Elemental Resonance
Having two Hydro characters in a party of four results in the Elemental Resonance:
*Soothing Water: Affected by Pyro for 40% less time. Increases Max HP by 25%.
Elemental Reactions
Hydro has the following Elemental Reactions:
* Electro Electro-Charged: Deals Electro DMG and high Poise Damage over time to all nearby targets with the Wet status.
* Cryo Frozen: Immobilizes the target and applies a Freeze aura.
** GeoPhysical Shatter: If the Frozen target is hit by a Blunt Attack Blunt or Geo attack, deals Physical DMG and unfreezes the target.
* Pyro Vaporize: Deals ×2 Hydro DMG when a Hydro attack triggers the reaction.
* Anemo Swirl: Deals Non-AoE Hydro DMG while spreading the Wet status to nearby enemies.
* Geo Crystallize: Creates a Hydro shard. Picking it up creates a Hydro shield around the character.
* Dendro Bloom: Creates a Dendro Core that explodes after 6 seconds, dealing AoE Dendro DMG.
** Electro Hyperbloom: Triggered when applying Electro to a Dendro Core. Transforms the Dendro Core into a homing Sprawling Shot that deals increased AoE Dendro DMG in a much smaller AoE.
** Pyro Burgeon: Triggered when applying Pyro to a Dendro Core. Detonates the Dendro Core immediately, dealing increased AoE Dendro DMG.
Wet Status
Wet itself does not have any special effects; it is simply considered the application of Hydro. However, being affected by Wet allows Hydro Elemental Reactions to occur.
Any source of Hydro DMG will apply Wet. It will also be applied during Weather Rain rain and upon coming in contact with bodies of water.
Wet Status to Self
The following Talents apply the Wet status to its user and/or the active character.

<title>Baizhu/Lore</title>
<text>The owner of Bubu Pharmacy, the finest pharmacy in all of Liyue. He is rarely seen without a white snake named Changsheng coiled around his shoulders. His prescriptions are varied and diverse, and his medical prowess and compassion are known throughout Teyvat.
Personality
The owner of Bubu Pharmacy, who is rarely seen without the white snake named Changsheng. His medicinal knowledge is encyclopedic, and his personal intrigues subtle.
Many rumors swirl about Baizhu, though most of them are currently unknown - the only one the player ever hears about is that his traditional herbal medicines are extremely bitter. Despite the poor taste of his medicine, most Liyue citizens have complete faith in his medical skills, such as Keqing, who considers him the right person to visit when someone cannot identify their symptoms and Xinyan, who is grateful for his highly effective voice preserving medicines. One of his patients, a sickly young girl named Hongdou, dislikes his medicine greatly and only agrees to visit Bubu Pharmacy because Baizhu is so kind to her, reasoning that just seeing him would make her feel better.Hongdou She also believes he is very clever.Good Medicine Tastes Bitter Baizhu's reputation is so great that even the isolated adeptus Xiao is aware of him, and his employee Herbalist Gui takes great care in his work to avoid sullying the good name of Dr. Baizhu and Bubu Pharmacy.Herbalist Gui Despite his great medical skill, Baizhu is not regarded as "a man of high caliber or great courage."
After meeting her by chance in the hills, Baizhu took Qiqi in, despite her being a zombie with memory so poor she could barely sort herbs or remember his face. His acceptance of Qiqi was tied to his own personal pursuits, and Baizhu has grown increasingly more relentless in his pursuit of eternal life since meeting her. However, it is later revealed that Baizhu sought immortality in order to protect both himself and Changsheng, aware that those who made contracts with her would eventually die young and he does not want to have others suffer the same fate as them, while not wanting her to die either. Despite having some ulterior motives in taking her in, he is able to make Qiqi cancel orders she has given herself by embracing her and speaking words such as "I love you the most." However, the effect is greatly diminished because Baizhu speaks these words very lightly. At the same time, he quickly acquiesces to whatever she may request from him with no worry at all and affectionately refers to her as "my little Qiqi."Guizhong (Quest) Qiqi, who is well aware of his intentions, does not mind staying with him because of his concern.
Furthermore, he is very protective of Qiqi. Xingqiu, though interested in Qiqi's story, finds it is impossible to have a conversation with her whenever Baizhu is around. Baizhu has also repeatedly intervened in Hu Tao's attempts to lay Qiqi to rest; something that Qiqi dreads and fears. Even after Hu Tao gave Qiqi an exception, she still holds a grudge towards Baizhu for his desire to live longer.
Despite the genuine efficacy of his medical practices, his business practices tend to be shady. Changsheng remarks he is pleased to have found new people to fleece after the sale of Everlasting Incense to the Traveler and Zhongli, although Baizhu does not appear to mind her warnings. Despite Changsheng's suggestions of Baizhu's own questionable conduct, he has also had dealings with the legal advisor Yanfei about charlatans selling ineffective remedies. To Paimon, his sly attitude during their first two meetings seemed strange, yet Yanfei brushed off her concerns and claimed that Baizhu has always acted that way.A Teapot to Call Home: Part I
Appearance
The Applications of Medicine
Baizhu is a tall man with light skin and long green hair, half tied up in a bun and secured with a hairstick. He has golden, snake-like eyes and is always seen wearing a pair of gold, ornate, oval-framed glasses. Before taking on Changsheng's contract, his eyes were dark pink. Baizhu is almost always seen with his pet snake, Changsheng, draped around his neck like a scarf.
Herbalist Gui, another employee of Bubu Pharmacy, remarks that Baizhu suffers from an unknown ailment that makes him rather frail. Qiqi, despite being a zombie who has to regularly exercise in order to stave off rigor mortis, is in better physical condition than he is. However, it is later revealed that his contract with Changsheng was responsible for his frailness, though he is able to recover as long as he does not over-exert her powers.
Official Introduction
Baizhu: Living with many maladies, where will one find a cure?
Dr. Baizhu... Something is bothering him, but he won't tell me anything... He hates death, but he's always researching it... I don't understand... But that's not a problem. I know... that Dr. Baizhu is a good person.
"There's a pharmacy in Liyue called Bubu, and in it is Dr. Baizhu. His skills make all illnesses better, but his medicines are really bitter!"
This nursery rhyme has been widely spread throughout Feiyun Slope, and it has been used by countless parents to warn their children not to get sick... "or else."
However, it seems that the main character of this nursery rhyme is hardly feared by children. Instead, it is with utmost affection that he is called "Mr. Baizhu" by them.
This impression is mostly attributable to Baizhu's gentle and friendly demeanor. Interacting with him is a most refreshing experience. And no matter how anxious the patient may be, his confident smile will never fail to reassure.
Regrettably, Baizhu cannot save all his patients - himself, for example.
Herbalist Gui has mentioned that Baizhu's physical condition is extremely poor, and he often has to go back to his residence to rest after seeing patients. Even so, his smile never falters while in front of people.
When Gui asked him about this, he replied, "If the doctor looks sick himself, how can his patients face their illnesses with confidence?"
Day after day, Baizhu heals his patients. His ever-present smile hides the numerous bitter medicines he takes and the pain he suffers alone.
Character Stories
Baizhu, the owner of "Bubu Pharmacy," is a master of the medicinal arts. He is benevolent and kind, yet also shrouded in mystery and other contradictions.Despite having countless admiring physicians begging for his attention, he has insisted on choosing a zombie who can barely sort medicinal ingredients to be his apprentice.And though only a mortal, a talking snake with powerful spiritual energy is always wrapped around his shoulders.Maladies major and minor may all be mitigated with his medicine, but the physician seems unable to cure himself.Such a person does not go unnoticed in Liyue, for the greater a person's capabilities, the greater the calamity they could cause should their heart harbor any evil intent.Yet both public observation and private investigation have not only found no trace of any hidden wickedness, but have seemed to confirm time and time again that his unimpeachable reputation as a benevolent doctor was, in fact, the unvarnished truth.As for all those inscrutable secrets, Baizhu simply smiles and laughs:"Good medicine is so bitter, so it shouldn't be a problem to let a good doctor keep a few secrets, no?"
Though he was widely known by the moniker "Mr. Bai," Baizhu's last name isn't "Bai." The origins of this misnomer can be traced back to his apprentice at Bubu Pharmacy, Qiqi, and her sieve-like memory.When she first arrived at Bubu, her memory was even worse than it is now, and she would even forget to return to the Pharmacy at night after going out to gather herbs and ingredients during the day.Fortunately, Baizhu is always patient when dealing with patients, and doubly so when dealing with Qiqi. At first, he attempted to have her stay at the Pharmacy and rest, but Qiqi was always resolute and could not be dissuaded from harvesting materials, saying: "My responsibility." Helpless to stop her, Baizhu would personally go out to find her each and every time, and remind her of the fact she lived with him at Bubu Pharmacy over and over and over and...With a memory like what Qiqi sported then, remembering anyone's full name was beyond the realm of possibility. So for a long time, the names "Baizhu" and "Changsheng" were simply replaced with "that person" and "that snake."Ever one to prescribe just the right medicine for the disease, Baizhu prepared a notebook for Qiqi to write in and review whenever she had time. Finally, there came a morning when Qiqi saw Baizhu and did not cock her head and ask who he was, but said:"Good, morning. Bai... Bai..."Changsheng was ecstatic, and immediately extended her body outward, even more excited than Baizhu:"Yes, yes, Bai-what now? And how about me? Don't forget about me-""Mr. Bai." Qiqi answered earnestly. "And, long... long, snake.""-Outrageous! My name isn't 'long snake'-""Remembering things is like curing an illness. One cannot be too greedy for progress, but be satisfied with gradual improvement." Baizhu smiled slightly and nodded, as though having accepted the name "Mr. Bai."
Baizhu is not only a brilliant physician, but possesses considerable business acumen.This should not come as a surprise - it would be impossible to operate a such a large pharmacy on the strength of one's medical skills alone.The prices at Bubu Pharmacy are generally fair, and the pricing strategy for most products is one of high sales with low margins on each transaction. But there is some merchandise priced at a curious premium - such as the "Everlasting Incense," which was 2,990,000 Mora even after a discount.Usually, the customers for goods like these aren't picky about price, and only care about the quality and effectiveness.So why head to the market to haggle and search, when you can get everything you need at Bubu Pharmacy? Even if it's a bit more expensive, the peace of mind provided by Mr. Bai's reputation is worth it.Naturally, price is not Bubu Pharmacy's only competitive advantage. Many of the customers are businesspeople who have become "partners," bringing Baizhu rare herbs from across the land and exporting the medicines he develops to every corner of the world. As the pockets of Bubu's business partners began to bulge, so too did the Pharmacy's ledgers.But the objectives of Baizhu's plans do not seem to revolve solely around Mora itself. If they did, why would Bubu Pharmacy take care of someone with no positive impact on income flow like Qiqi? It makes no sense from a business perspective.When encountering unusual or novel diseases, Baizhu often accepts only a token fee, saying "It is difficult to assess a fee for such a rare ailment."As this practice has persisted, clients from far beyond Liyue have come to seek treatment at Bubu Pharmacy. Baizhu never refuses a patient, and is very willing to treat people from all walks of life, regardless of the disease that afflicts them. Thus has the good doctor cultivated a reputation as a selfless and benevolent healer who makes money elsewhere, presumably so that he can continue to perform acts of kindness far into the future.But only Baizhu himself understands the truth: Bubu Pharmacy never engages in unprofitable transactions.
Baizhu habitually has a pot of water before boiling a pot of tea after waking up early in the morning. There is never a shortage of pastries at the Pharmacy, both sweet and salty, delivered from nearby shops and from around the neighborhood. This routine has never ceased, and is unchanged through all four seasons.The snacks are divided into three portions, two large and one small. The large plates are for Baizhu and Herbalist Gui, and the small plate is for Qiqi and Changsheng. Whichever of them so desires can take a bite, and this counts as having had breakfast with everyone.In addition, the doors of the Pharmacy are always lined with fresh supplies when it opens in the morning: vegetables, rice, fresh fish, melons and fruits... there is always an abundance of food at Bubu Pharmacy.Baizhu has repeatedly attempted to persuade the community not to give him such gifts, as he does not like to take things from others for free. But the public knows that Dr. Baizhu doesn't always charge for his consultations, and offers steep discounts upon already reduced prices to the people. The child of this family, the grandfather of that household... The number of people who have benefited from his care is beyond count. Of course, since cheaper healthcare means more Mora in the pocket, using the savings to give gifts by way of thanks is a perfectly sensible thing to do. Baizhu's attempts to dissuade his well-wishers were defeated by this logic, and his only remaining response was to ask Herbalist Gui to bring all the gifts from the door into the shop.After breakfast, the clinic opens for consultations. Baizhu remains in the shop to see patients, and Herbalist Gui delivers medicines wrapped and prepared the previous night to elderly patients who have difficulty walking. Each package comes with a detailed note explaining clearly both the frequency and quantity of medicine to be taken for the convenience of the patient.When patients begin arriving at the clinic, Changsheng takes leave of her perch on Baizhu's body and wanders about the clinic. If she catches Qiqi performing her calisthenics in the courtyard, she will wind about Qiqi's shoulders and help her keep time with a "one two three one two three," and so on. If she runs into Herbalist Gui delivering medicine in the corridor, she will rest on his arm and ask after the latest neighborhood gossip.After the talking is done, the medicine weighted and packaged, and the tea has cooled, it is time for lunch. At this time, Baizhu is at leisure to personally prepare a nutritious meal and sweet soup that are both healthy and tasty for all who come to call.Afternoons in Liyue Harbor are a leisurely affair, with studying children, tottering old grandparents, Millelith carrying spears... An endless patter of footfalls. Changsheng and Qiqi lie by the pharmacy door, basking in the sun and watching the flow of people. They idly observe that the one on the left has let their hair grow too long and needs a haircut, while that one on the right has a rash on their face, and might be suffering from an internal imbalance. The sound of their chatter reaches Herbalist Gui's ears, and fearing disturbing others, he brings over a bench and moves Changsheng and Qiqi back inside the pharmacy.The commotion reaches Baizhu's clinic, and he listens to their exchange as he writes a prescription. Time is like boiling water in a copper kettle: at once both a turbulent tumult but also sitting quietly beside you.As night falls, Bubu Pharmacy closes for the day. Herbalist Gui sometimes stays for dinner, and sometimes goes home to eat with his family. Then only Baizhu, Qiqi, and Changsheng remain, and the two people and one snake may eat and drink to their hearts' content, returning to their rooms to rest by the light of the moon.One cannot call such a day anything out of the ordinary. It is simply a day at Bubu Pharmacy. Though, if Herbalist Gui suddenly had the thought to come back and take a peek before going to bed, more like than not he would happen upon Baizhu teaching Qiqi new exercises in the courtyard to keep her limber.One-two-three, one-two-three... Morning, noon, and night, spring, summer, and fall - oh, and also winter... Calisthenics and life both have their rhythm.
The storyteller rapped the wooden table, opened his mouth, and began to tell a tale of ghosts and demons. Though the public loves to hear these stories, they get old after too many tellings, and so people asked, "is there anything else? You've told the one about the jewel-seller and the one about the thief, what else is there?"At that moment, Baizhu came down the stairs, and the audience saw him and thought to themselves: Dr. Baizhu has many stories, surely, but putting them into a book might be far too difficult. Other than discussing his exemplary behavior and medical ethics, if one wishes to say a few words about him over tea or after dinner, the most that can be talked about is the Doctor's private pursuit of the adeptal arts and the like, a matter that Baizhu has never intended to conceal.There are a multitude of visitors to Bubu Pharmacy, and those with sharp eyes cannot avoid noticing the books Baizhu reads in his spare time. In addition to medical treatises are ancient tomes which record the ways in which the adepti may be sought out. In addition, the medicine chests at Bubu Pharmacy contain a multitude of rare herbs and ingredients which are of no use in treating common illnesses, but are constantly used and replenished in an endless cycle. Though the average patient may not understand the arcane implications, those from families which practice alchemy or thaumaturgical arts can instantly recognize that all of these are ingredients used to refine various "Elixirs of Immortality" spoken of in legend.For most ordinary people, "immortality" is simply too strange a concept. But there are people whose curiosity will be aroused, and who will seek to know just how Baizhu wishes to attain immortality and how far along the road he has come... But this has proved akin to walking on a tightrope at night - it is difficult to take even a single step.Eventually, news of Baizhu's quest spread. Once the news was leaked, people formed an opinion. Some coveted his knowledge, some opposed this pursuit, and others didn't particularly care about his goal of immortality, but were concerned about the trouble his methods might cause.Baizhu himself was in his clinic, but his fingers were on the pulse of the street, and he had anticipated this would happen. In the vast land of Liyue, the concerns of the third group of people would be the most difficult to assuage. He had initially planned to quietly dispel any doubts, but the name "Baizhu" had already appeared on the Ministry of Civil Affairs' persons of special interest list. Fortunately, Baizhu always conducted himself impeccably in his daily life, and is amiable and willing to chat with his patients during their consultations. From these visits, he learned that the Ministry of Civil Affairs was keeping a close eye on him.He saw through their methods, and turned the ears and mouths of the people to his own ends, letting them spread the word on his behalf that his research and approach had no ill intent and would cause no trouble.Rumors spread more quickly than the most infectious pathogen, and soon the fact his quest was benign had spread to every corner. This push and pull between Baizhu and Ministry continued for some time, but eventually he was able to avoid unwanted attention and his name avoided appearing in the top secret intelligence reports of the owner of Yanshang Teahouse, Yelan.As for the aforementioned second group of people, their beliefs are already a known quantity, and set in stone. Many are the descendants of a clan that believes firmly in the principle that some things are divinely ordained, and that the impermanence of life and permanence of death are among those immutable truths. It must be pure coincidence that the representative of this second group lives but a street away at Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.As the saying goes, neighbors are like relatives and friends, and Bubu Pharmacy and Wangsheng Funeral Parlor have had many interactions over the years, and both parties greet each other with a smile when their paths cross in the street. As for those questions of life and death, death and life, the opinion of the 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor Hu Tao is as follows: If the matter cannot be explained or settled in a couple words, it's better to have Baizhu over for dinner! And as for a sensible person like Baizhu? Of course one should attend the banquet! Season after season, year after year, without going into too much detail, the two households with very different views have spent many a day together, and could be considered close friends, albeit with each keeping their secrets.When two parties do not align closely, they merely speak of etiquette. But when they align, one may speak of duty. For Bubu Pharmacy is in the business of healing the sick, and in the course of business it is inevitable that there will be those beyond saving or at the end of their lives. Those with good fortune are cared for by their family, but those less lucky will breathe their last in Bubu Pharmacy. When this happens, Bubu Pharmacy and Wangsheng Funeral Parlor will jointly ensure their final rest is peaceful.The last rites and journey of the deceased is of great importance, and Director Hu Tao entrusts this to her most dependable consultant, Zhongli. For Bubu Pharmacy, Baizhu cares greatly for those patients who pass away under his care, and personally sees to their arrangements. The two parties hold a ceremony in a secluded thatched cottage in the dead of night. Baizhu sends the deceased there, and the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor consultant holds the ceremony and performs the final rites, carrying out each step in an orderly manner. Even if it is simply going through the motions, the departed may rest in peace.It is a pity that though the soul has passed on, no living soul will ever thank Bubu Pharmacy or Wangsheng Funeral Parlor on the deceased's behalf. But the heavens wheel ever onward, and so too does the cycle of life and death continue unceasingly. Doctor and Funeral Director and consultant are neighbors by coincidence, friends over the dinner table, but only truly meet heart-to-heart when conducting the solemn duty of seeing off the souls of the deceased. Once they walk out of that thatched cottage, they return to their former selves.
Every time the weather turns cold, the threshold of Bubu Pharmacy is crowded with patients seeking a consultation. But today, Baizhu's silhouette was nowhere to be seen. Only his assistant Herbalist Gui was at the counter, prescribing medicine and dispensing medicine. Those with recurring illnesses who visited frequently knew what this meant. It was "one of those days" again, and so they took the medicine carefully wrapped by Herbalist Gui. They offered their best wishes, such as "Please tell Dr. Baizhu to care of himself," and shuffled out the door.At that moment, Qiqi came in from the doorway and bumped into an old man's calf. Holding her hat tight, she nodded and hurried to the back room with her stiff steps as quickly as she could."It's one of those days" isn't a particular time or place, but rather is shorthand for an oft-used statement: The Doctor is ill, and cannot see patients today, so we are sorry you came all the way here for nothing, please come back some other time.It is hard for physicians to cure themselves, and this is true for Baizhu as well. Baizhu claims that it is simply a chill, but he knows that he has a weak constitution, and all of his internal organs are diseased. Though his life is not in imminent danger, nine out of ten doctors would be dumbstruck, only able to gape in wonder at the nature of this rare and incurable disease. Therefore, whenever his symptoms flare up, all Herbalist Gui and Qiqi can do is bring him hot water, cloth towels, and plates of fruit to show their concern. Baizhu does not wish others to worry on his behalf, and insists on being alone in his room with only Changsheng for company.With the curtains pulled over the tightly closed windows, the room was dark and gloomy. Baizhu lay down, tormented by the chills and following hot flashes, occasional breathing problems, and intermittent yet intense full-body pains that often came whenever his symptoms flared up. After a bout of agony, he joked to Changsheng, "If I don't make it one of these days, it'll be a giant hassle, won't it?"Changsheng slithered up the head of the bed and looked down at Baizhu's sweat-soaked visage with human-like pupils. "Oh you, oh you, you may lie, but you may not die. Who is it that wishes to live forever? You are not yet old, and haven't yet experienced a full life."A man and a snake, the snake with human eyes and the man with snake eyes. A strange phenomenon indeed. Few know the truth behind such an enigmatic anomaly. In fact, the pupils in their eyes are proof of their greatest secret - the contract between them. The result of this contract is the Baizhu of today - practicing medicine to save lives and alleviate the pains and aches of humanity, but also embedding illness deep into his own bones, where they reside forever with no hope of relief.And in the land of Rex Lapis, God of Contracts, the law is supreme and contracts must be abided by. Liyue is an ancient country with a multitude of spiritual beings and magic, and the contents and types of contracts are equally varied. But Baizhu and Changsheng never discuss the contents of their own contract, and always share the same response: Contract? It's just an agreement, you could say it's just a secret technique with a couple of restrictions on how it can be passed down. Those too old or young, those who are insincere of heart, the inhuman, all of these cannot inherit this technique... What else is there? Oh, yes. "Those not fated to cannot inherit it!"Qiqi put down the tea tray and hot water, closing the door behind her as she left. Baizhu watched her leave before let out a long sigh, as though he had a thousand worries caught in his throat, but was unable to give voice to a single one. All he could do was shift the conversation to a distant rumor-In ancient times, there was once a Mt. Yaojun, and the Herblord master of the mountain and their Fujin tea-loving friend once made a pact to wait until the tea trees on the mountain had grown, then hold a tea banquet, inviting all the adepti to partake of their tea. What a beautiful thing that might have been! But alas, of the two Adepti who made the agreement, one sank into the water like the residual remnants of tea leaves, and the other lost all ten of their fingers for picking tea, and even their memories of the past faded and were forgotten.Changsheng hissed an impatient reply: "What's so strange about that? The adepti are gone, but don't their tea trees remain? The tree and tea leaves will remember their ancient agreement in their stead. You should worry more about yourself, for if you and I leave, only Herbalist Gui, Qiqi, and the wood of the house and bricks on the floor will remember the two of us."The name of the contract with Changsheng is known as "Way of the Dragon-Dragging Jade Snake." Only the name of contract is known, and not even Changsheng can explain the details, only that she learned it long ago. If you ask who she learned it from, she cannot recall even a bit of tangential information. Talking about the distant past with Changsheng is often like this. Baizhu is used to listening to her advice, though, and understands she has good intentions. Thus did he vomit up the blood stuck in his throat before sitting up straight against the head of the bed.Changsheng glanced over: "What're you looking at me for? I don't have hands to support you with."Cradling the soup made for him by Herbalist Gui and Qiqi, Baizhu slowly drank it. He got through it one spoonful at a time, his eyes never leaving the soup for a moment, as though there was an entrancing scene of spring flowers and autumn leaves at the bottom of the bowl.The small things, one at a time. The basic essentials of daily life. Life is like soup, boiling and cooking.
In Liyue, a form of divination is often used to predict fortune and peril or ask the gods for guidance. The people of Liyue call their particular art "Zhanbu."It is said that in ancient times, medicine and "Zhanbu" were tightly linked and often confused. With no scientific understanding of birth, old age, sickness, or death, the ancestors could do naught but pray to the gods for wellness and take medicinal herbs for comfort.Over time, countless generations experiencing sickness and recovering upon taking different herbs were able to distill their knowledge into a set of rules, making breakthroughs in their understanding of medicine. Thus was medicine born, with trained physicians curing the sick.After becoming an heir to this medical tradition, Baizhu brought Changsheng to Liyue Harbor to open a pharmacy and practice medicine in the bustling port city. At that time, the following story took place:According to the traditions of Liyue, new businesses must divine an auspicious time for their grand opening using the art of "Zhanbu." By sticking to the preordained opening day, the business will prosper and enjoy fame and fortune.But Baizhu did not wait until the day of good fortune. One night, a mother brought her fever-stricken daughter to the door of the pharmacy, frantically pounding on the door....Early the next morning, the neighbors were shocked to discover that the pharmacy had opened several days early, with no fanfare or celebration."Aren't you afraid of going bankrupt and losing everything?" Changsheng's voice was full of regret. "All you did was treat an emergency case last night, why would you need to open up shop early?"Baizhu replied as he wrote a prescription: "Every day delayed is another day the patients must wait for their consultation. Besides, what pharmacy wants business to boom? We aren't hoping for more people to get sick, are we?""That doesn't mean you should just throw open the doors without even thinking of a name for our shop! And what about a celebratory message for the grand opening?""A name and a message... Then let us send the message that no matter the fortunes of this shop, or the diseases afflicting our patients..." Baizhu picked up the prescription note and faced the rising sun framed through the door. "...Or our fates, we don't need to ask the gods or use divination any longer."In the language of Liyue, "Zhanbu" is divination, but "bu" can also be the word for a refusal or negation. Thus, he chose a name that enshrined his beliefs.The rays of sunlight were shining through the door and the thin paper in his hand, with the words written by his hand clear and confident-"Bubu Pharmacy, Baizhu."
When Baizhu was young, his hometown was struck by a horrific plague.Fortunately, his Baizhu's Master master was practicing medicine there, and was able to contain the spread.But no miracle could bring back the lives that had already been lost. Having lost both his parents, Baizhu began to follow in the footsteps of his master, learning the physician's art.The world is full of strange and complicated diseases, but Baizhu's master was always able to provide treatment. Studying with his master, Baizhu learned a simple truth: Disease is dangerous, but it can ultimately be overcome with human intellect....Until the day finally came that Baizhu's master was completely exhausted by the maladies brought on by a contract, and could hold on no longer.Though Baizhu had learned much in those years, he was still unable to do anything in the face of such a complicated and serious affliction.That most intractable disease in the world, the one with no cure or answer - death - had finally come for his master.Was there really no escape from sickness and death for mortals?The memories of his parents coughing blood from his youth had grown hazier over the years, but the scene of the cold tombstone of his master was crystal clear before his eyes.Standing before his master's grave, Changsheng's normally playful words were tinged with an imperceptible sense of melancholy."Who knows how many more people will take on this contract..."Baizhu did not want to see yet another precious life slip away before his eyes."No. This contract will end with me."When he next opened his eyes, they shone with a golden light, as though they were unquenchable candles.

<title>Energy</title>
<text>Energy is the resource used to execute Elemental Bursts.
Overview
The amount of energy required for each Elemental Burst varies and can be checked in-game via the Skill Attributes section of a character's Talents menu. After a character uses their Elemental Burst, their energy is completely drained.
A character cannot have more energy than is required for their Elemental Burst, nor can a character have negative energy.
When a character is Fallen Characters knocked out, they will lose all their energy.
Particles and Orbs
Elemental particles and orbs are primarily dropped by characters' Elemental Skills and by enemies who lose HP. When particles and orbs are picked up, they regenerate energy for the entire party.
Particles and orbs only give energy once they reach a character, not when they are generated. As a result, it is possible to switch the active character before the particles or orbs are received so that a different character can recover more energy.
Particles and orbs also only begin to travel to the character if they are in range, and they disappear if not collected within approximately 30 seconds and 9 seconds, respectively.
There are also some weapons that can generate elemental particles, and the Elemental Resonance High Voltage will generate an Electro elemental particle on a 5-second cooldown if an Electro-related Elemental Reaction is triggered on an enemy. Lightning strikes may occasionally produce one Electro particle.
The amount of energy that a character gains when a particle or orb is picked up depends on the character's element, their Energy Recharge stat, whether they are on the field ("active") or off the field ("inactive"), and how many characters are in the player's party.
The number of characters in the party affects the Conversion Rate of inactive characters.Bilibili:
* For 2 / 3 / 4 characters in the party, the Conversion Rate of inactive characters is 80% / 70% / 60% of the Conversion Rate of active characters, respectively.
* In Co-Op Mode, the number is determined by characters a player can control. For 2 Players, the host is considered to have 2 characters in their party, so the Conversion Rate of inactive characters is 80%  of the Conversion Rate of active characters.
The table below shows the conversion rates of elemental particles and orbs to energy without taking the Energy Recharge stat into account. For example, if the active character picks up an elemental particle of the same element, they gain 3 Energy at 100% Energy Recharge.
Character !!colspan=3 |Particle !! colspan=3 |Orb
Same Element!!Different Element!!Non-Elemental!!Same Element!!Different Element!!Non-Elemental
Active
3 || 1 || 2 || 9 || 3 || 6

Inactive (2 characters in the party)
2.4 || 0.8 || 1.6 || 7.2 || 2.4 || 4.8
Direct Energy Generation
Energy can be directly generated through some artifacts, weapons, character talents, and character Constellations when their activation conditions are met. Direct energy generation is not affected by the Energy Recharge stat.
Energy can also be directly generated at the beginning of Event domains or through Event effects.
Direct Energy Loss
Aside from using an Elemental Burst or becoming knocked out, a character's energy may also be drained by  Enemies certain enemies; Ley Line Disorders such as High Voltage; and effects from weapons and Artifacts, such as Katsuragikiri Nagamasa and Shimenawa's Reminiscence.
Particles Generated by Elemental Skills
Energy/Data Elemental Skills
Elemental Skills can generate up to 5 particles at once or a smaller number of particles at intervals upon hitting an enemy. These particles will match the respective character's element. The particles generated will spawn at the location of the enemy hit, the player, or the construct that generated the attack, depending on the Elemental Skill. A small number of characters do not generate any particles at all.
Particles can be generated even if no damage is dealt due to an enemy's elemental immunity or a shield that prevents all damage. However, some Elemental Skills that deal coordinated attacks will not trigger against enemies that cannot take damage, thus preventing those Elemental Skills from generating particles.
The amount of particles generated by some Elemental Skills are not fixed. These skills have a guaranteed amount of particle generation (which may be 0) and a chance to generate 1 additional particle.
Some Elemental Skills have a cooldown for particle generation, which is independent of the cooldown of the Elemental Skill itself. After an attempt to generate particles from a successful hit, the particle generation cooldown will be entered, even if no particles were generated.
Hitting inanimate objects or non-hostile wildlife will not generate elemental particles, with the following exceptions:
* The press version of Razor's Claw and Thunder can generate particles upon hitting non-hostile wildlife.
* Wriothesley's Normal Attacks enhanced by his Icefang Rush and Charged Attacks enhanced by his There Shall Be a Plea for Justice can generate particles upon hitting inanimate objects.
Particles Generated by Enemy Drops
Energy/Data Enemy HP Drops
When an enemy's HP decreases to a certain threshold, it will drop Energy particles or orbs. The HP thresholds and drops vary across different enemies, with larger enemies tending to have more thresholds, and one enemy may have up to 4 such thresholds. Depending on the type of enemy, these particles may or may not be elementally charged; for example, particles and orbs dropped by Slimes are always of their own element.
Note that if a threshold has already been reached, and the enemy is healed over that threshold, reaching this threshold again will 'not' drop Energy.
Energy Generated by Normal Attacks
When a Normal Attack Normal or Charged Attack Charged Attack hits an enemy, it has a probability to generate 1 Energy for the character. Every time a Normal or Charged Attack fails to generate Energy, the probability will be increased. When Energy is successfully generated, the probability will be reset. Energy restored this way is not affected by Energy Recharge.
Weapon Type !! Base Probability (%) !! Probability Increase Per Fail (%) !! Avg. Hits Taken

Bow || 0 || 5 || 6.29

<title>Yun Huang</title>
<text>Yun Huang zh=云凰 zh_rm=Yún Huáng was the eighth head of the Yun Family who lived around 500 years ago. She was the only child of master weaponsmith Yun Hui and took over the family business after he became one of the Liyue Qixing.Blackcliff Warbow
Yun Huang and Han Ce are the main characters of the Blackcliff Series weapon descriptions.
Story
Yun Huang had been a headstrong martial artist since childhood; so when her father gave up his position as head of the Yun Family to take a position among the Qixing, instead of marrying and having her husband inherit the family business as per family tradition, Huang took the mantle herself.
However, right around that time, Liyue experienced a crisis: during an expedition to The Chasm (Subregion) The Chasm to mine crystallized blackcliff, master weaponsmith Han Wu of the Han Family, who worked closely with Yun Hui to create the Prototype Series, was involved in a cave-in.Blackcliff Longsword Sometime after Han Wu and the survivors managed to escape, massive earthquakes disrupted the land, forcing the mines to close for the workers' safety.Blackcliff Slasher The Yun Family, which relied on the mines, struggled to stay afloat and Huang began to fear that her family's legacy would end with her.
Shortly after Huang prayed for a miracle, Han Ce - Han Wu's son - appeared before with the newly crafted Blackcliff Warbow, knowing Huang specialized in archery. After testing it, she realized it was the breakthrough she had prayed for.
Sometime afterwards, an unnamed thaumaturge traveled to Qingce Village where Huang lived, seeking Huang and Ce. He presented them with a piece of Cor Purum, a gift from the thaumaturges of Liyue to repay them for their fathers' work on Prototype Amber. The two took the stone and created Blackcliff Agate, which held the power to detect tectonic movement via ley lines.Blackcliff Agate</text>

<title>Eberhart</title>
<text>Eberhart was a historical figure who lived in Mondstadt during the Timeline The Aristocratic Period Aristocratic period. He was the half-brother of Parsifal and Ingbert. Due in part to his illegitimacy and the stories he heard of the old aristocracy, he came to resent his noble lineage and yearned to restore the original glory of the aristocracy, regardless of the cost.
He was the owner of the Unnamed Gladiator and manipulated the gladiator into continuing to fight even after he had won his freedom. After his gladiator's death at Vennessa's hands, he would eventually become the mastermind behind the deaths of the Dragonspine expedition team primarily comprised of young Mondstadt aristocrats. During this event, he was grievously wounded and his ultimate fate has been left unknown.
Profile
So what if those who came after should despise me? I will do anything to achieve my goals.
Eberhart was cruel and manipulative, using his glib tongue and promises of fine rewards to entice his unnamed gladiator into continue fighting - and killing - for his sake.Gladiator's FinaleDeathmatch He used this sort of manipulation later on to persuade the rest of the Dragonspine expedition team that those lost in the snowstorm would be able to make it back safely, and incite them to investigate a different location before their intended one in the hopes of reducing the numbers of the remaining members of the expedition.Ancient Investigation Journal: Part II
Eberhart believed that the ends justified the means, and was willing to stoop to all sorts of vile methods to achieve his goals. This included goading his half-brother Parsifal into becoming a criminal who eventually fled Mondstadt, as well as manipulating and eventually killing Parsifal's lover, the Blue-Eyed Spear Witch.
Story
Little is known about Eberhart's origins or lineage, but he was an illegitimate heir to an aristocratic family, likely Landrich's.Ancient Investigation Journal: Part III According to the author of the Ancient Investigation Journals, this may have led him to plot a rebellion against his fellow aristocrats.
Eberhart owned an unnamed gladiator, and manipulated the gladiator into continuing to fight for his entertainment even after the man had won his freedom. This gladiator would eventually fall at Vennessa's hands.
Some time before the expedition to Dragonspine, Eberhart incited his legitimate brother Parsifal to become a phantom thief and then eventually deceived him, forcing him to flee. Somewhere in this same time period, Eberhart studied under the Blue-Eyed Spear Witch, becoming her disciple to better learn how to use a spear. After learning her ability to target fatal flaws, he used her love for ParsifalCrescent Pike as an opportunity to betray her and kill her. It's unclear what his reason was for killing her, but his reason for causing his brother to flee was ostensibly so that he had a better chance of claiming legitimacy.
Some time after the death of his gladiator, Eberhart embarked on an expedition to Dragonspine alongside Ingbert, Nick, Luther, and some other unnamed members. However, by this time, he already conspired to betray the aristocrats and laid several well-planned traps that dwindled the group's numbers down to only himself, Ingbert, and Luther. He attempted to slay Ingbert and Luther personally, and while he succeeded in taking down Ingbert and mortally wounding Luther, he was gravely injured himself. He made it back to his boat with little trouble and left for Mondstadt, knowing that if news somehow made it back to Mondstadt, then Priscilla - a woman who was familiar with both Eberhart and Luther, but ultimately chose Eberhart's side - would light a torch at Stormbearer Point to warn him.Ragged Records According to Luther, this plot to kill Ingbert was probably in order to move ahead in the line of succession.
Back in Mondstadt, the aristocracy ultimately discovered Eberhart's plot, and confronted and presumably killed Priscilla after she lit the beacon to warn him.Missive Windspear According to Stevens, there is no record of Eberhart returning to Mondstadt and so his fate afterwards is unknown,A Land Entombed although he has presumably died by now. It is also unclear whether the revolt he was going to be part of was Vennessa's rebellion or something entirely different, and whether he managed to take part in it or not.</text>

<text>quote  = The Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing. Keqing has much to say about Rex Lapis' unilateral approach to policymaking in Liyue ⁠- but in truth, gods admire skeptics such as her quite a lot.She firmly believes that humanity's future should be determined by humans themselves, and that they can even do better than the archons and adepti have done for them.

Personality
quote  = The Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing. Keqing has much to say about Rex Lapis' unilateral approach to policymaking in Liyue - but in truth, gods admire skeptics such as her quite a lot.
The Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing, Keqing. She is a workaholic and is subject to pressure even at her young age. One might attribute her to perfectionism when pertaining to work, causing many of their employees to resign but in reality, she has a strong sense of responsibility and tenaciousness inherited from her grandfather.
Keqing, unlike most of Liyue, is a great skeptic. She believes that humans should deal with their own problems but it all changed when the Lord of Geo retired from his duties, passing it on to the Qixing. She gained a new respect towards Rex Lapis himself, realizing the magnitude of his work to govern Liyue. As part of her so-called "self-reflection", which in reality is a way to hide the newfound respect she has for Rex Lapis, she keeps memorabilia of Rex Lapis. She was also a skeptic of Visions, viewing it as both challenge and insult and once tried to destroy it, all of her attempts failing. She'd then realized the various uses of her Vision and learned to appreciate them.
Shopping is a favorite past time of the Yuheng, often spending her free time with her friends in this sort of activity. Keqing may be an uptight and intimidating character, but she respects and cares for each of her companions close to her. It's only because of her outward image that she's unable to express how she truly feels.
Appearance
Piercing Thunderbolt Opulent Splendor
Keqing uses the Medium Female Characters medium female model. She has fair skin, amethyst eyes with oval-shaped pupils backed by a shape resembling her stiletto, and waist-length purple hair that turns into silver-purple at the ends.
Official Introduction
Keqing: With the Force of Thunder Comes the Star of Change
The Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing. Keqing has much to say about Rex Lapis' unilateral approach to policymaking in Liyue ⁠- but in truth, gods admire skeptics such as her quite a lot.
One of the Liyue Qixing, Keqing has an uncompromising belief in actions over words. If she sees something that needs doing, she'll do it herself. For example, she traveled around Liyue and carefully memorized each detail of the land so that she may one day be able to maximize the utility of every last inch of Liyue.
Keqing deals with the day-to-day affairs of Liyue, whether great or small, while Rex Lapis only descends once a year.
To many, the millennia of prosperity that Liyue has enjoyed serve to legitimize Rex Lapis' guidance of the city. But Keqing has her reservations about all this, viewing Liyue's present prosperity as akin to a magnificent sandcastle on the beach - humanity does not have the luxury of deciding when the tide will come in.
Rex Lapis has watched over Liyue for a millennium. But what about the next millennium? What about the next ten, or the next hundred millennia? How long are we expecting this status quo to last?
It is this unanswered question that drives Keqing to work relentlessly and remain diligent.
From most people's perspective, there is no point in working oneself up like this. But Keqing cannot sit by idly and ignore this hidden danger.
The people of Liyue have never considered navigating the future on their own terms. But someone must walk on the front line of the epoch and forge a new path with their own hands.
From most people's perspective, there is no point in working oneself up like this. But Keqing cannot sit by idly and ignore this hidden danger.
Character Stories
Rex Lapis has brought prosperity and plenty to Liyue Harbor, and his rule and majesty have long passed into show and song, much to the delight of the people. But for someone in such proximity to a god, Keqing seems to lack the requisite respect the most."Hmph. Let's be real here, but does Morax really know everything?"The Liyue Qixing deal with the day-to-day happenings in the Harbor, whether great or small, while Rex Lapis only descends once a year.While history has shown that following Morax's lead has been the right call, Keqing believes that humans should have their own pride, and that their views deserve equal importance.As such, she often advocates different opinions from Rex Lapis, and is the first to put such views into practice.Her radical actions have seen stellar results, but they have also attracted murmurings of opprobrium among those devoted to Rex Lapis.As Keqing sees it, such opposition are the excuses of those who have grown complacent under the aegis of their deity, and who cannot consider the future of humanity of their own accord.But someone must walk on the front line of the epoch and create a new path with their own hands - and the Yuheng star is determined to do her part in this endeavor.
Keqing is the daughter of an illustrious Liyue family with a proud lineage, and she is better acquainted than most with the influence that Rex Lapis has over the people of Liyue.Once every few years, in an almost cyclical fashion, a major reshuffle hits Liyue's economy after the Rite of Descension.Once Rex Lapis' new policies are announced, some families celebrate while other grieve. The poor hope it will offer them the chance to finally make their fortunes while the wealthy pray that theirs will not be swept away in the changing tides.Rather than carefully analyzing the economic climate, merchants are more prone to making investments based on belief.And in present-day Liyue, this is a forgivable strategy: Rex Lapis is a powerful deity and he can be relied on for all things.But Keqing has her reservations about all this: What if, one day, Rex Lapis stops fulfilling his duty? Then what would become of the people of Liyue?Liyue's present prosperity is akin to a magnificent sandcastle on the beach - humanity does not have the luxury of deciding when the tide will come in.However, Keqing has been unable to garner majority support for her views. From most people's perspective, life is but a brief insignificant moment in Liyue's long history, and there is no point in working oneself up into an existential quandary.This perspective, as far as Keqing is concerned, is a lazy and cowardly one that denies there is any value at all in the existence of the human race. "If humans really have no value," Keqing retorts, "then why should we expect the gods to care about us so much?"Unwilling to compromise on her beliefs, she cast her skepticism on everything - everything from Rex Lapis' loving-kindness, to the people's laziness, to the way that society runs.Issues affecting humans' fate should be handled by humans, and humans are more capable of handling them with finesse.Finally, the day came of her now-famous speech at the Rite of Descension."Rex Lapis has watched over Liyue for a millennium. But what about the next millennium? What about the next ten, or the next hundred millennia? How long are we expecting this status quo to last?"On hearing these words, Rex Lapis burst into hearty laughter. But as for what exactly he was laughing about, only Rex Lapis himself knows.
Some may be able to keep up with Keqing's forward-thinking ideas, but none can keep up with her pace of work.Perhaps in an effort to become a role model for her people, she demands of herself to work ten times harder than the average person, and she cannot abide by any measure of laziness or inefficiency.Humans' abilities and lifespans are more limited than the gods'. This means that one has no hope of living to see the day when humans replace the gods as masters of our own universe if one allows apathy and hesitation to slow themselves down.Because of this same mindset, she is never able to synchronize her work rhythm with the people around her. Whatever the task, she does not rest until the job is done, and when something should take half the month to resolve, she will pull out all the stops to try and get it turned around within the next 48 hours.Additionally, Keqing's notion of "completing" something is far more ambitious than simply getting it "finished" - she will make sure that every relevant detail is tied up too. To the outside observer, she seems to be both highly efficient and a perfectionist.But not everyone is as self-motivated as Keqing, No assistant she hires ever makes it past the three-month mark. She has received countless remonstrations urging her to be less impatient, but she meets each one with a stern rejection. Still, she has, to some extent, come around to the idea that high staff turnover is itself a manifestation of inefficiency, and made some concessions accordingly.Today, if you encounter an assistant of Keqing's dealing with some matter three, four, or even five years ahead of time, don't be alarmed, this is completely normal. Keqing gave them a bit of a head start, but she'll be catching up before long.
"Yesterday's experiences make me stronger today." This is one of the principles Keqing lives by.Spending all of one's time at Yujing Terrace means seeing the same old things day after day. But to be able to think and act as swiftly as lightning, one needs a huge amount of experience to draw on.So, if Keqing sees something that needs doing, why, she'll do it herself. For example, she once served for two months as a laborer to better decide how to refine a plan to improve their treatment.It's hard to imagine that this young lady with so much authority vested in her has pulled carts at the Chasm, rammed earth at the south wharf, and waited tables at small diners.In addition to working, she also once took the opportunity to gather evidence with which to report a powerful individual known for his abuses.He was apprehended without any clue as to how he had been exposed, but when he was brought to the interrogation chamber by the Millelith, there he saw a striking young lady dressed in fine robes."Hey! Haven't we... haven't we met somewhere before?" The words felt foolish the moment they rolled off his tongue, even to him.Especially because the Millelith then introduced her as follows: "This is the Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing. Know your place and keep your distance!"
Rex Lapis' departure has put Liyue Harbor through a great deal of hardship. All the duties Rex once fulfilled have been taken up by the Qixing and the Eight Trades.Now that divine rule is a thing of the past, the old strictures left behind can't simply be continued wholesale. But to establish new laws for Liyue, whose history spans several thousand years, is no mean feat.At first, Keqing was incredibly enthusiastic about this task, having long prepared for this day when she might finally show her mettle. But several months in, and she was still stuck on a single task, land infrastructure - and it was driving her up the wall.No matter how hard she struggled, the mountain of tasks was like a quagmire. She was making a difference, yes, but not nearly with as much ease as Rex Lapis."Why can I only do this much? Why... can't I do it better?" Of course, she had long understood the wherefores here. Her lack of respect for the gods had somehow received their recognition all the same, yes, but that didn't mean that she was ready to simply replace them.But she was still Keqing, resolute and tenacious. From that day on, she shut herself in, studying classics of various kinds to learn all that she needed. Placing herself lowest, she accepted all that she had hitherto not known with open arms.During this period, she gained a certain calm, slowly discarding the "opprobrium" she had long held against Rex Lapis.They were both working for the good of Liyue, after all - and two people who love the same thing need not be on opposing sides.She also seemingly came to an understanding concerning the smile Rex Lapis had given her during the Rite of Descension. It was, Keqing now believes, an expression of acknowledgement and expectation.She hasn't lost any of her forceful and decisive manner, no. But sometimes, when she feels lost, she will stop and think: "What would Rex Lapis do at a moment such as this?"
Keqing, who has dedicated a large portion of her energies to Liyue Harbor, indulges in an unexpected pastime when she can spare a moment - shopping. On her off days, she changes into ordinary clothes, contacts a few close friends, and enjoys a day of strolling around Feiyun Slope and Chihu Rock, just enjoying the act of buying things.After Rex Lapis' departure, Keqing managed to maintain this method of decompression despite her busier schedule, though with one subtle difference.On one of her shopping trips, she happened upon a small and unremarkable stall that sold cute Rex Lapis clay figurines with tiny bodies and big heads.Persuading her friends to visit the silk store opposite, she approached the stall, took a figurine in her hand, and began to examine it.She knew that she didn't have much time. So, after glancing around to make sure that no one was watching, she paid for, picked up, and packed away her prize in one swift single movement.But no sooner had she placed the figurine into her bag and heaved a sigh of relief than one of her friends, silk bundles in tow, tapped her on the shoulder. In the end, all was revealed. Her friends were quite curious: Wasn't Keqing a skeptic among skeptics? Why would she buy one of these?"For... For introspection, of course! There's nothing wrong with self-reflection, is there?" So she said, and it would be convincing, too - if Keqing didn't already have an entire shelf dedicated to Rex Lapis self-reflection memorabilia...
Though she is of noble birth, Keqing tries to keep her luxuries to the bare minimum that would befit her position as one of the Liyue Qixing.And when she is outside the borders of the prosperous city, she will often head deep into uninhabited areas to strengthen her knowledge and sharpen her will.She has experienced countless challenges, but unlike backpackers and adventurers, she does not bring anything with but her hairpin and her sword. As long as it is infused with Electro, a hairpin can become a knife with unmatched sharpness.Cutting grass, chopping firewood, skinning game and carving bone are all well within its capabilities.If faced with a drop of great height, she only needs to pin it into the ground, tie rattans to it, and rappel down.It also serves as an incredibly sensitive security device when camping out. Any unusual movements nearby will cause it, when tipped over and placed perpendicular to the ground, to alert and awaken Keqing immediately.It can be used to fish: Keqing just hurls it into the water when she's feeling peckish, and there will always be a few fish that will get knocked out by the electric shock - and of course, finding a stick to grill the fish on is not a problem either.Some narrow-minded folk have ridiculed Keqing's hairpin for being old and worn, but this does not anger her. Indeed, she considers it a point of pride. "Its weathered form is what gives it its charm."
Keqing is likely a skeptic without equal when it comes to the value of Visions.She knows that everything she has is the result of her own hard work, but that in the eyes of others, credit has been given instead to her Vision.She once believed that this purple crystal had stolen the pride due originally to her, and that it was both a challenge and an insult from the gods.In fact, she has tried to destroy her Vision countless times - she's left it in a huge fire for three days and three nights, run over it with a minecart full of rocks, and has even hurled it from the heights of the Jade Chamber.Unfortunately, she has never been successful.With no options left, and not wanting it to fall into the wrong hands, Keqing was forced to accept the Vision as part of her life.With the passage of time, Keqing came to appreciate the Vision. She realized that this item did not actually have any divine will imbued within it, and indeed had numerous practical uses, and as such chose to use it."The source of power is far less important than the character of its user."Regardless of how she may once have regarded it, Keqing's Vision and its powers have become a part of her.Thank the Archons she hadn't destroyed it back then, or she'd have regretted it for sure - oh, the hardships of being a pragmatist.

<title>Kujou Sara/Lore</title>
<text>Leader of the Tenryou Commission's forces. A charismatic woman who acts as swiftly as a storm wind and always honors her word.She bears the title of "Devotee of the Divine" and has sworn her allegiance to the Raiden Shogun.The eternity that the Shogun pursues is the cause that she is willing to fight for.
Kujou Sara is a member and adopted daughter of the Kujou Clan, who serves the Raiden Shogun. She supports her Vision Hunt Decree and leads troops to seize Visions. Kujou Sara is also described as a "tengu warrior" with "wings as dark as a raven".YouTube:
Before the events of the game, Kazuha's friend challenged the Raiden Shogun over her Decree. Kujou Sara accepted the challenge on the Shogun's behalf and prevailed against his friend in the ensuing duel which she came out victorious. Before she could claim his Electro Vision after giving him the Divine Punishment which resulted in the passing of the brave soul, Kazuha, who had just entered to witness his friend's demise, inexplicably snatched it and fled from Inazuma.Follow the Wind Sometime later, she defeated Arataki Itto and seized his Vision as part of the decree.
Personality
A general of the Tenryou Commission. Bold, decisive, and skilled in battle.
Despite being an adopted member of the Kujou Clan, she is immensely loyal to the Shogun's rule and tirelessly works to create the eternity that the Shogun desires, even if she does not live to see it herself. Those who speak to her note that she has a ruthless, yet efficient and stern attitude, fitting for her position in the Tenryou Commission. Her devotion to the Shogun's cause and her honorable conduct has gained her the respect of those under her command. She prefers doing everything herself when possible; compared to other Tenryou generals, she participates in battle alongside her men (and head-on attacks as a result) rather than remaining at the back. She despises dishonorable conduct and those who betray the Shogun's will.
Sara's dedication to the Shogun seems to stem from the fact that she believes the Shogun saved her from death when she was bestowed an Electro Vision as she was falling a great height during a battle. This action not only led to her life being spared but to the young tengu being adopted into the Kujou Clan and an unbreakable devotion to the Electro Archon. Although Sara appreciates Kujou Takayuki Takayuki adopting her, she expresses a sense of loneliness in that she can tell he doesn't truly regard her as family and doesn't treat her the same way he treats his biological children. Kamaji is the only one who treated her as his real sister.
She enjoys quick and easy-filling foods, but dislikes sweets because they put her at ease, something which she finds unfitting for her duties.
Appearance
Solemn Purity
Kujou Sara uses the Tall Female Characters tall female model. She has indigo hair cut into an uneven bob, pale skin, and golden eyes. As a tengu, she has two pairs of black raven-like wings that can unfurl from her back; these are seen in one of her idle animations and when she unleashes Subjugation: Koukou Sendou, her Elemental Burst. Additionally, on the side of her head lies a red tengu mask that resembles a crow's face with white accents, a black crest, and a hexagonal piece resembling a Tokin (headwear) tokin.
Official Introduction
Kujou Sara:Fly Like the Wind, Strike Like Lightning
I must admit, Kujou Sara is an opponent that cannot be taken lightly. Although we have opposing views, her loyalty and sincerity is truly admirable... I believe that in the entire Inazuma City city of Inazuma, she is the one with the most adoration for the Shogun.
Leader of the Tenryou Commission's forces. Bold, decisive, and skilled in battle.
If the Almighty Shogun is the sound of thunder that fills the heavens, Kujou Sara is the lightning strike against which her enemies are powerless to defend themselves - and wherever lightning first strikes, terrifying thunder is sure to follow.
As the adopted daughter of the Kujou Clan, she conducts herself with an official demeanor at all times. Ask anyone about their impression of Kujou Sara, and they will likely talk of her ruthless efficiency and stern attitude.
Yet this loyal subject of the Shogun is not as cold and indifferent as she seems on the surface. Rather, she has surrendered herself to the demands of her role, her strong sense of duty causing her to put aside her own desires in service of a greater cause.
For Kujou Sara, helping the Almighty Shogun to achieve eternity is a paramount goal. She knows that she herself may not be there in the end, but she devotes herself to this mission all the same.
"Victory will belong to all of us, even if I am not the last person remaining on the battlefield."
If people could have only one wish, this would be Kujou Sara's.
Concealed beneath her icy exterior is a heart that pounds like thunder, where passionate flames burn in secret.
Character Stories
The blood of the tengu runs through Kujou Sara's veins, but she does not dwell in the forests and mountains as they do. She was fostered from a young age by the Kujou Clan and has served since then as part of the Tenryou Commission.The Tenryou Commission is one arm of the Tri-Commission, and is in charge of the security of Inazuma. Today, Sara is a general of the Tenryou Commission, and hers is the vital task of maintaining order within Inazuma City itself.She governs well and is ever determined to set a good example for her subordinates. No matter how tough the issue, if it falls under the Tenryou Commission's jurisdiction, Sara can solve it in good time.Sara smiles little and is swift and resolute in the pursuit of her missions, and so many Inazumans consider her an inaccessible, stone-cold military person.However, such an assessment might be too surface-level for someone like Sara, who seems cool on the outside but burns within.
In Inazuma, the Vision Hunt Decree is the manifestation of the Raiden Shogun's will to pursue Eternity, and Sara is the main enforcer of that decree.Sara believes that Visions, in the hands of those with incorrectly-aligned minds, will destabilize the foundations of Inazuma, thus necessitating the Vision Hunt Decree.However, this does not mean that Sara will stoop to any means necessary to enforce it.When citizens are inevitably affected as the decree is carried out, she will expend the utmost patience and sincerity to attempt to explain the Almighty Shogun's long-term goals.She has also given clear orders forbidding the harming or exploiting of civilians during the pursuit of the decree, as such evil deeds will only drag the great name of the Archon through the mud.Unfortunately, the vast ideals of the Archon are too great for mortals to perceive, and resentment arises nonetheless, with some even uniting to resist those who enforce the decree.In such circumstances, where she has no choice but to take action, Sara often sighs helplessly before facing the enemy.
The Shogun's Army has Kujou Sara's leadership to thank in large part for the fearlessness and unity of its soldiery.Surveying battle lines, setting up training plans, selecting weapons and armor... Unlike many generals who prefer to strategize and plan from the rear, Sara prefers to do such things herself.Sara is very harsh on herself during training, with her personal regimen being over ten times tougher than that which the ordinary troops go through. Even when night has fallen and the world has gone to sleep, one can still hear the sounds of her bow being drawn echoing through the dojo.On the battlefield, she has always been at the tip of the spear, leading the troops with absolute heroism and awe-inspiring fighting spirit.When the dust has settled, she will also personally see to the wounded, and give reward and mete out punishment based on merit. Every step of the battle that passes through her hands is managed well, with missteps being very few and far between.Sara's troops are all witnesses to her words and deeds. No one who has fought alongside her does not hold her in the highest regard.The general is the soul of the army, and fine generals are hard to find. Small wonder, then, that Sara has always been the pride of the Shogun's Army.
Even when she is not training, Sara brings her austere, strict nature into her daily life.Her life seems to follow some sort of eternal, unchanging rule. She wakes up on the dot, trains on the dot, eats a fixed amount...From things as large as training regimens to things as small as food consumption, Sara has her own perspective and pursues her self-created standards to the last letter."Miscellaneous objects are to be sorted by category, and furnishings are to be arrayed in straight lines. There is to neither be dirt in any corner, nor on the ground."These are the standards Sara holds her dwelling up to.She views excellence in such matters to also be a part of her training, and handles them herself, not requiring the aid of any servants.That said, how could her servants ever just stand idly by? Every time they meet Sara, they will implore her to put the cleaning cloth down and leave the matter to them.Having repeatedly declined their offers to no avail, Sara eventually took to cleaning up behind closed doors, posting up this sign outside her room-"Training in Progress, Do Not Disturb."
Although she has grown up amongst humans, Sara still maintains the various habits of the tengu. When she leaves the Tenryou Commission Headquarters on occasion, it is mostly to go to the mountains.She knows them like the back of her hand, and has witnessed many strange creatures not often told of in human tales.Among them are many fierce and evil things, but there are also little creatures that mean no harm. To Sara, however, these are just differences in form.There was a time when a sizable spate of thefts was reported to the police station in quick succession, and they could not find the culprit. Walking through the woods on higher alert than usual, Sara quickly espied the Bake-Danuki bake-danuki running along hurriedly while carrying their plunder.Of course, bake-danuki are not evil by nature, but only steal food out of gluttony.Capturing the creatures, Sara had only this to say as she reclaimed their ill-gotten gains:"Hiding in the mountains will not let you escape judgment. Listen closely, for this is your final warning. Do not make yourself a nuisance to civilians again, or else..."The bake-danuki were chilled to the bone, nodding as they balled up in a corner. After this, they would keep to that agreement and did not again do such ill.As for the sharp-tongued Sara, she would bring various melons and fruits that could keep for a longer period up to the mountains while training there, making sure to deposit them in the bake-danuki's dwelling whenever she passed through.She did not explain herself, and in any case, did not consider this any sort of gift. If she had to describe it... then perhaps a sort of consolation to those who had turned from an unrighteous path might be the best description for such things.
Sara has been training with the Shogun's Army ever since she was taken in by the Tenryou Commission. The soldiers actually thought that she was a boy at first due to her coming to train at an early age, and they took care of her very well.Having been a little frightened of crowds at first, Sara became much more outgoing due to this warm reception, and would even play games with the other troops.However, the soldiers she played alongside were severely punished by the Kujou Takayuki Clan Head, while she was merely given a cold chastening."Not following military law and neglecting your training... I did not take you in just to have you do such pointless things."Since then, Sara would be conscientious in maintaining a certain distance from others. Rather than blending in with the crowd, she sought first to attain surpassing martial prowess, bearing in mind at all times that she would someday take command."The Raiden Shogun's helper. An example to the Tenryou Commission. The pride of the Clan Head."None of these three identities put her first in any way. But to Sara, this was her. She was a warrior whose being was calm and austerity.No one ever told her that she should give herself more consideration, and Sara did not necessarily lack such concerns either.Her chains as an adopted child and the solitude of a non-human had always accompanied her mission and status.But to stop due to such obstacles is the dilemma of the weak, and being Kujou Sara, her path would not end here. She would be the Electro Archon's staunchest adherent and the most clear-headed of her generals.
Out of their worship and love for the Raiden Shogun, many merchants have created and sold artwork related to her.The most popular product among them is the "Statue of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder," a lacquerware doll made using the deity's image as its template.Sara rose early the day it went on the market, easily becoming first in the queue to purchase the statue. This became something of a hot topic for a while.Sara would make no retort concerning any such stories. From her perspective, she bought that item with pious respect in her heart.In all matters related to the Shogun, she had never once committed a perfunctory or negligent act. Indeed, she went forth personally to select and purchase a statue and even personally prepared a shrine within which it might be kept upon her return.She placed five such statues in specially-placed display cases, and would clean them whenever she returned home. If she could not be there, she would arrange for artisans to perform that maintenance instead...To someone like Sara who lacks friends and who is too busy to have much of a private life, the Raiden Shogun is not merely a deity, but also a form of repose.The Shogun is her will, her future, her strength... even the harbinger of her fate - the confluence of all that is noble. Sara's adherence is one born out of recognition and trust.The intricately-made Archon statue makes Sara feel like the Almighty Shogun is not far off in her Tenshukaku, but is a wisdom, an ideal, a strength of heart that supports her every step of the way.These moments of tranquility bring her indescribable enjoyment.
When she obtained her Vision, she had not yet been given a name or surname.She originally lived in a quiet mountain forest that had, from a time unknown, become plagued by great evils that robbed it of its former peace.Though she had the strength of the tengu, she was still young and could not stand against the monsters alone, and was hurled from a cliff during the battle, her wings having been damaged prior.Plummeting from the heights, and unable to unfurl her injured wings, she seemed fated to fall to her death."No! It can't end like this! I... I always believed that I could protect this place forever with my strength..."When day dawned the next day, some passers-by discovered an unconscious girl by the roadside. She looked a little worse for the wear but seemed otherwise unharmed, adding to the mystery of how she had ended up here.Astonished, the people brought her back to the city and reported the matter to the Tenryou Commission immediately.That was when the Kujou Clan Head, Kujou Takayuki, noticed that the glowing item in her hand was a Vision - a thing that many desired but few ever gained.Realizing that she had gained the attention of an Archon even at her young age, Takayuki believed that she was a destined child, sent to the Tenryou Commission by the heavens.Taking her in, he named her "Sara," and would train her to become an all-around warrior, asking that she serve the Shogun and fight for Inazuma.Kujou Takayuki believed that in raising such an excellent general, the status and future of the Kujou Clan would become more secure. And indeed, all that he had hoped would steadily come to pass.Sara, armed with her Vision, would swiftly distinguish herself, rising through the ranks to become a general of the Tenryou Commission at a young age, just as many had hoped.Yet it was precisely because she possessed a Vision that Sara knew this better than anyone: her surviving that fall unscathed was due to the Archon looking upon her with favor in that instant.In but a single glance, she had been given the power that sustained her life. Everything she had, therefore, could be described as existing by the Almighty Shogun's grace.Fighting for the Shogun...Sara believed that this was neither her duty nor a result of her foster father's schemes, but was instead her truest calling.

<title>Chongyun/Lore</title>
<text>An exorcist who roams the land with Liyue as his base of operations, evil spirits fleeing wherever he goes. As the heir to a clan of exorcists, he has always possessed abilities superior to most. However, these abilities are not the result of training, but of an inborn trait - a pure yang spirit.
Personality
A young exorcist from a family of exorcists. He does everything he can to suppress his abundance of yang energy.
The young exorcist from Liyue, Chongyun. One might find Chongyun as a composed and stoic individual, though his friends might not say it is true most of the time.
Chongyun is a positive individual quite literally, as he has an excess of positive energy in him. Due to this excess in positive energy, he's vulnerable to things that warm him - fiery events, food, drinks, clothing, the sun, and even blushing. In the event he is not able to suppress those feelings, he might enter a manic state of being excited, friendly or faint. In extreme cases, he may show extreme signs of irrationality. To counter said positive energy, he always wears light-colored and light-weight clothing and usually eats cold food, though even with these methods and despite his efforts, he still has issues overcoming his unusual constitution.
Despite having a Vision, he's not as fond of it as others, believing that training is the way to become a stronger individual. Due to his intense training and the sole focus of exorcising a demon, Chongyun is extremely introverted in everything outside of exorcism.Signs of Evil He regards Xingqiu as a friend due to their similar agendas despite being pranked on by the bookworm on a frequent basis, which he usually tolerates. Even beyond Xingqiu's pranks, Chongyun can be quite gullible, such as once taking the contents of a novel to be real-life events until informed otherwise.
Appearance
Pure Spirit
Chongyun uses the Medium Male Characters medium male model. He has light blue hair reaching his ears, pale skin, and ice-blue cat slit eyes.

With Liyue as his base of operations, the exorcist Chongyun roams the land, ridding it of evil. As the heir to a clan of exorcists, he has always possessed abilities superior to most. However, this ability is not the result of training, but of an inborn trait he has come to term, "congenital positivity."
Congenital positivity is an exceedingly rare physiology that makes the body susceptible to heating up due to an overabundance of positive energy. If unchecked, those who possess such a form can easily become hot blooded. Chongyun is a particularly serious case, his shifts in mood are explosive, and he remembers nothing from such episodes. However, Chongyun's condition is also his greatest asset, for all he needs to do to expel evil spirits is to sit awhile in whatever dark corner they may haunt.
As such, Chongyun's path as an exorcist has been smooth as smooth can be. However, he himself does not approve of this manner of doing things. In his honest and upright heart, leaning on his unique physiology to exorcise evil is but a cheap trick. An exorcist must, in his estimation, perform their duties with an exorcist's arts.
To counteract this congenital positivity, Chongyun has several disciplines that he practices. He does not go out in the sun or wear thick clothes, and he abstains from hot beverages and hot and spicy food. He takes up no quarrels, and he indulges no tempers. Yet despite searching high and low, and far and wide, he has been unable to find a lasting solution to his condition.
This troubled the young exorcist. The evil spirits were expelled, yes, but if things kept going like this, how would he ever prove himself to be a qualified exorcist?
As he sits atop an ice-capped mountain chewing on a snow bun, Chongyun cannot help but sigh. The road ahead is still long indeed.
Character Stories
Throughout its long history, Liyue has never had a lack of rumors and myths regarding all manner of evil spirits and demons. And regardless of the truth of such rumors, someone has to do something about them.Chongyun was born into a renowned family of exorcists, and has possessed a natural ability to drive away evil spirits from a young age due to his pure-yang spirit. His powers of exorcism are far beyond the norm: his mere presence is sufficient to scatter evil spirits.However, this has proven to be an inconvenience for Chongyun himself, for though he has undertaken hundreds of successful exorcisms, he has never come face-to-face with a single ghost or demon.Chongyun believes in his heart that a true exorcist should exorcize evil with charms and swordsmanship. This natural ability that he has... is just not orthodox.Therefore, he has dedicated himself to the study of exorcism techniques and martial arts, as well as seeking the haunts of evil spirits to prove himself an able and professional exorcist even without his unique physical condition.Yet, when will that condition stop being a stumbling block on his path to self-realization?
When Chongyun first ventured out as an exorcist, there had been much talk of an evil spirit lurking inside Liyue Harbor.The victim of these hauntings was a woman from a family with a high enough stature to even have a word or two with the Liyue Qixing.From a time she knew not when, her sleep began to be harassed by sounds that kept her awake, but every time she tried to follow the sound, it would suddenly shift behind her, and begin ringing again in her ears.This shock caused her unspeakable distress, and she even lost weight for loss of appetite.Her wealth was enough to hire the best exorcists from all over, but no matter what they tried, they had to retreat empty-handed. And not only did the noises persist, they even grew in boldness.It was then, just when she had given up all hope, that Chongyun walked through her door."I apologize for coming just now, it has been far too sunny lately... I heard that this place houses a very stubborn ghost. Please, leave it to me."Then Chongyun brought a chair over, and sat upon it in the middle of the house for a time.That night, the strange sounds were no more.The wealthy woman finally had a good night's sleep, and she came running to Chongyun the next morning with an overabundance of gold and jewelry as a reward.But Chongyun, as was his wont, only accepted his usual fee of a few hundred Mora without an ounce of emotion on his face.Ever since that incident, Chongyun has found that his reputation precedes him for miles around. He has become beloved in Liyue for his "style and character," and indeed scholars have given him this appellation: "a heart of clear water, and a face of ice."
However, calling his mannerisms and style "frosty" couldn't be farther from the truth.Due to the abundance of yang energy in his constitution, he is constantly troubled by increased body temperature and sudden urges or impulses.He has tried everything to alleviate the issues both physically and psychologically.His methods include not drinking hot water, not eating hot or spicy food, wearing light clothes, not getting into arguments, keeping himself from being angered, staying indoors on sweltering days, and always bringing a parasol when on the job.In short, he attempted to stay away from everything that might aggravate his condition.Despite all this, his yang energy did not subside a whit.A little depressed, Chongyun began to wrestle with his own body. When he heard about an evil spirit in Dragonspine, he made for the peak wearing only a shirt.Though it was hard enough to keep himself warm, he still felt this insufficient. Digging a hole in a frozen lake, he jumped in and soaked in the icy water while waiting for the evil spirit to show itself.After staying in the lake for half a day, he finally caught a glimpse of his target.However, after pursuing it down to the mountainside, he discovered it was only a snow rabbit that had been frightened off by his flying swords and floating charms.The fever that he ran afterward lasted far longer than it would in a normal person.
Chongyun's pure-yang spirit is not only a huge obstacle in his path as an exorcist, but a constant daily hassle.He must be extra careful to stay away from "heaty" things, to which he is very sensitive, or risk his yang energy and emotions going out of control.Chongyun's clan once held a celebration party at Wanmin Restaurant. And though he waited until all the dishes had gone cold, he did not expect the tender rice balls to be stuffed with Jueyun Chili.After but a single bite... Chongyun had no recollection of what happened next.However, according to the victim, chef Xiangling of Wanmin Restaurant, many unforgettable things happened.Chongyun first jumped onto the reception desk and shouted, "Everything's on me tonight!" - never mind that he did not actually have any money on him.He then began to chat with customers at other tables as if they were old pals, bragging to them of how incredible his clan's exorcist arts were, never forgetting to taste other people's dishes on the tables before he left.Lastly, he claimed to have sensed an evil spirit in Wanmin Restaurant. This he did not find, but he did slap a charm on Xiangling's forehead and chase her around with his sword.Afterwards, Chongyun scrimped and saved for an entire month to pay Wanmin Restaurant back for the mess and any damages he might have caused; he also gave Xiangling an evil-warding talisman that he carved by hand.But Xiangling, for her part, didn't mind Chongyun's "transgressions" at all. Instead, she felt that the crazy Chongyun was the real Chongyun, without any personal walls up.
Chongyun has had the privilege of meeting a true friend in his long journey as an exorcist: Xingqiu.In contrast to the hard-working Chongyun, Xingqiu was naturally gifted, and had a more flexible way of looking at problems.After learning about Chongyun's troubles, Xingqiu came up with a possible solution."If you can't reduce the effects of your yang energy, what if you sought out an evil spirit that is immune to it?"This was a eureka moment for Chongyun. Since then, Chongyun has no longer sought to alleviate his condition. Instead, he now tries to get Xingqiu to come with him to find such a spirit."What? Sightings of the legendary Aoyin near the Sea of Clouds? Leave it to me!""The old house at Feiyun Slope has been taken over by an evil spirit? My bad. I'll attend to it right away.""A master exorcist is staying over at Wangshu Inn? I could learn a lot from him... Hmm, better go with a gift."Xingqiu usually just makes these "leads" up as he goes, and thanks to his "advice," Chongyun often comes back empty-handed, blaming his bad luck."I tried my best to look for it, and even spent quite a sum purchasing more intelligence on that evil spirit - but I wound up missing it by a hair anyway," Chongyun says, abashed.If Xingqiu has time to spare when such an occasion arises, he will encourage Chongyun, treat him to some new cold dishes he has found and then set off to get Chongyun's swindled money back.A warm and reliable companion, indeed! - So Chongyun thinks at such moments. Who could he possibly trust, if not his fine friend Xingqiu?
In truth, Chongyun wishes that he could fit in more, but he is often forced to reject the invitations of others on account of his need to control his abundance of yang energy.Of these practices, he finds one particularly incomprehensible: hot springs.Bathing and "relaxing" in steaming-hot water? Even the sound of that scares him a hundred times more than freezing in a lake on Dragonspine.However, he has also heard everyone sing yearning praises of these hot springs, praising their comfort, and asserting that they become more so the hotter they are, and that one is filled with energy for a whole week afterward.Chongyun still doesn't know if this is true or if people are just teasing him.And he would have dared to try it out, if not for the ever-present problem of his pure-yang spirit.Xingqiu once asked him this:"If you were able to master your yang energy and rid the world of all evil spirits someday...what would you do after that?"This seemingly off-the-cuff remark troubled Chongyun deeply.Perhaps he had indeed missed out on a lot in life on account of his condition.But he doesn't regret spending time. If one way of living doesn't work, he just needs to find himself another - and in any case, he already has his answer.If that day comes, well, he'll go to the hot springs then.
The tomes that Chongyun's family has passed down from generation to generation detail every evil spirit they have ever subdued.From little critters to the monstrous demons found in tall tales of horror, their varieties are almost dazzling.It was one such terrifying story that inspired Chongyun's vow to rid the world of evil spirits.But as far as he is concerned, inheriting these books has... also proved inconvenient.Other than textual descriptions, the books also contain illustrations of said evil spirits that carefully detail their unique characteristics - even if the artist may not have been the greatest talent.But Chongyun has never seen an evil spirit in his life. Unwilling to break with this artistic tradition, he was at a loss.Ultimately, he would attempt to use his imagination to draw some suitably strange images.-Thus did the Field Guide to Demons and Beasts grow ever more exotic. Best not to think too deeply about that seven-winged, five-legged chicken-beast or that half-fish, half-hilichurl demon.
"Those other exorcists at least have the courtesy to wave their swords or tack on some talismans. You just sat here for a while, and now you say you're done, and that I should pay you? Who are you trying to fool?"Chongyun faced a great deal of suspicion when he first took up the role of an exorcist.He immediately faced one big hurdle: it was a lot easier to prove that "evil spirits are present" than not.Of course he would seem a charlatan even compared to "exorcists" who just went through the motions.With all the ability in the world but no place to use it, looked on with suspicion, and needing to suppress any passionate impulses...Those who eventually apologized to him were also few.But even so, Chongyun would not go with the flow, and use some fancy act to cover for his real method of conducting exorcism.Even with his unique composition posing countless obstacles for him, Chongyun has never once considered giving up.One day, he will become the greatest exorcist in Liyue, control his abundance of yang energy, and rid the world of evil spirits.Perhaps it was this resolve that earned him the gods' favor - that said, the Vision granted to Chongyun was one of "Cryo" rather than "Pyro."As to which of his goals it was that the Vision responded to, that is also a mystery.

<title>Kamuna Harunosuke</title>
<text>Kamuna Harunosuke ja=惟神晴之介 ja_rm=Kamuna Harunosuke was a historical figure in Inazuma who lived 500 years ago. He was an onmyouji who was dual-trained by the Adepti of Liyue and Inazuma's Tengu as part of The Yougou Three.The Narukami Trail He was the person who petrified Ioroi into a statue, and the last person to perform the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual before the Traveler's arrival.
He appears as the Mysterious Man during certain Earth Kitsune Statues' flashbacks in the Sacrificial Offering.
Profile
Harunosuke was an onmyouji from the Kamuna Clan, which developed the Kamuna arts utilized in modern times by the Kairagi.Kairagi: Dancing ThunderKairagi: Fiery Might The arts include paper seals that can coat weapons with elemental energy, even when the users have no Visions. Other developments he is responsible for include the art of Onmyoudou and the creation of Shiki Taishou. He also owned an esoteric domain called the Mystic Onmyou Chamber.A Tricky Situation
Story
Harunosuke, alongside Asase Hibiki and Mikoshi Nagamasa, went to Mt. Yougou to learn the Yougou Tengu's arts from Reizenbou.Tanuki-Bayashi in the Forest The three thereafter became known collectively as The Yougou Three. He also became familiar with Takamine the Mistsplitter,Interactable: Earth Kitsune Statue Araumi Earth Kitsune Statue in Araumi'Someone's Voice: "Have you seen Master Tengu, Harunosuke?"'
'Someone's Voice: "No, I haven't. Must be out fighting... But don't worry! This is the chieftain of the Yougou Tengu we're talking about here!"
'Someone's Voice: "I'm more worried about Mr. Takamine. Is he going to be alright?"'
'Someone's Voice: "...Hey, he'll be alright. He made a bet with me, after all..."' after he became a servant of the Great Tengu in exchange for ownership of Thundering Pulse.Thundering Pulse
During the cataclysm, Ei led a campaign against the dark forces of the Abyss,Mask of the One-Horned accompanied by Chiyo, the Great Tengu, the Kitsune Saiguu, and Takamine. Harunosuke expresses his worry over Takamine to Hibiki. Over the course of the cataclysm, Chiyo was corrupted and turned against Ei,Mask of the Kijin while both TakamineMistsplitter Reforged and the Kitsune Saiguu disappeared. In the "fury of his mourning," after helplessly watching Kitsune Saiguu sacrifice herself, he left for Liyue to learn the "more powerful 'way of the adepti.'"Hakushin Ring
Some decades later, the bake-danuki Ioroi, unaware of the reason for the Kitsune Saiguu's disappearance and believing she had left him hanging during a game of hide-and-seek, ended up raising trouble in order to try and lure her out. By this point, Harunosuke had returned and was dispatched by the Shogunate to address the issue. He did so by sealing away many of the bake-danuki, including Ioroi, into stone statues.Saimon Eri However, he did not seal some of them properly, causing some of the bake-danuki to eventually escape their prison.
He also met Hanachirusato, a manifestation of the Kitsune Saiguu's memories, and performed a Minor PurificationSacred Sakura Cleansing Summary on Narukami's Sacred Sakuras. During their first meeting, Harunosuke initially mistook Hanachirusato for Saiguu before quickly realizing her true nature as "filth." Nevertheless, he decided to not purify her as well, as she did not pose a danger to Inazuma.Sacrificial Offering After finishing his work, he left locked the ward he used near Saiguu's abandoned shrine, and summoned three Shikigami (the Mysterious Shadows) to guard the ward.
At some point, Harunosuke left Inazuma for Liyue, where he took the adepti arts and fused them with his transcension techniques to create the art of Onmyoudou. He used this new art to create the Mystic Onmyou Chamber and created Shiki Taishou. The chamber was intended to be used to help train the Shogunate forces to help defend their nation from the all threats by having Taishou create replicas of himself to be carried on the samurai as they fought enemies. Magical copies of these enemies would then be stored in the chambers, allowing them to train in relative safety. However, the Shogun's intervention in protecting Inazuma eventually made the existence of the chamber pointless. Shiki Taishou eventually convinced him to let go of his burdens; seeking a new purpose, no matter how long it took, Harunosuke left for areas unknown.</text>

<title>Chi</title>
<text>Chi zh=螭 zh_rm=Chī, also known as Qingce zh=轻策 zh_rm=Qīngcè in the ancient language,Diary of Roald the Adventurer was a God who dwelt in what is now Qingce Village before being defeated and sealed away by Morax.The Quest for a Cure There still remains many legends surrounding its banishment, which are detailed in the The Chi of Yore.
The term "Chi" may also refer to a type of dragon-like sea monster that lived around the Liyue region and the oceans beyond it.Serpent Spine
The Chi of Mt. Qingce
Thousands of years ago, Chi made its nest in the area now known as Mt. Qingce and took control of the region. For this, Morax fought it at a "great height" and succeeded in slaying the beast. However, even after its death, the Chi's power continued to seep into the land. To suppress its power, Morax defeated each aspect of the Chi:
...Rex Lapis overcame the Chi, but the Chi could not perish in its entirety. Thus did Rex Lapis conquer each of its facets in turn: its spirit was bound in the north, its bones were pinned in the south-east, its flesh was incarcerated in the north-west, its soul was fettered in the north-east, and its form was crushed in the south-west...
Additionally, Morax taught the people of Qingce Village to make Geo Statues to crush the Chi's remaining power. Many of these statues can be found scattered across the area around Qingce Village, some of which have glowing features for unknown reasons. Additionally, crystalline orange adeptus amber can also be found around Qingce, which also helps suppress and crush the Chi's power.Adeptus Amber: A Striking Sight
Over time, a legend formed that the Chi's body turned into Mt. Qingce after it died, with its scales forming the terraced fields. People in Liyue believe that the Blood-Fed Trees in Bishui Plain grew by absorbing the Chi's blood, and that the area where they grew are the Chi's eyes. However, Zhongli reveals that Mt. Qingce stood long before Chi ravaged the area.The Stars Inscribe the Year's Wishes note=Zhongli's open world dialogue
During 'The Chi of Yore', the Traveler enters the vault in northwestern Qingce. Within it is a giant glowing orb suspended in midair, underneath which is the Qingce Cache mechanism. Upon activating the mechanism, the Traveler has to defend the mechanism from various Ruin Machines while rocks crash down from the ceiling. After completing the challenge, the treasure room is opened, but the Traveler and Paimon report to Granny Ruoxin that no traces of Chi were found, leaving the glowing orb within the vault a mystery.
During The Heart of Healing, the ethereal remains of Chi lingered in a cave, and was collected and converted into medicine by Jiangli, an old acquaintance of Baizhu who apprenticed under the same master, so as to treat her husband Jialiang's heart disease. However, Chi's remains were too potent for mortals to tolerate, and so both eventually succumbed to great illness. At the end of the quest, Baizhu destroyed the remains of Chi inside the cave, which cleansed the poison within Jiangli and restored her to good health.
Other Chi
The Skipper, who lived around a thousand years ago, defeated at least one Chi and turned its spine into his greatsword, known as Serpent Spine zh=螭骨剑 zh_tl=Chi Spine Sword.</text>

<title>Apep</title>
<text>the character the Trounce Domain set within the character The Realm of Beginnings
Apep is the ancient Dragon of Dendro and one of the Seven Sovereigns, who ruled over Sumeru before the arrival of the Heavenly Principles. It survived the conflicts of old and is still alive in present day, and appears during the climax of Homecoming.
Profile
As one of the original Seven Sovereigns, Apep is a powerful elemental dragon who contains an entire world inside itself, within which it birthed and protected the first and most ancient Apep's Creatures elemental lifeforms of Teyvat.Where Lies the Path Home However, Apep's attempt to accumulate forbidden knowledge to fight against the Heavenly Principles led it to become contaminated by the very power it sought, which in turn corrupted its source of power - the Heart of Oasis - and the elemental lifeforms dwelling within it.What Shape Does the Self Hold Not only did this cause immense suffering for all of them, it also had repercussions for Sumeru's ecosystem - Tumors of The Withering are the form Apep's elemental lifeforms take at the end of their lifespans due to the torment of forbidden knowledge.
Lesser Lord Kusanali purges forbidden knowledge during Chapter III, unintentionally leaving a gaping void within Apep and causing the elemental creatures to lose some of their memories. In their quest to bring the elemental creatures back to their home, Lesser Lord Kusanali and the Traveler learn more about Apep's condition and vow to restore the Heart of Oasis. They eventually succeed and Apep is freed from its millennia of suffering. It decides to rest and recover for the time being, forgoing its previous plans of revenge to observe how Lesser Lord Kusanali and humanity will develop.
Appearance
Apep's true appearance is never seen in its entirety, but its silhouette appears as a massive serpentine dragon with large, bright eyes overflowing with Dendro, and covered in numerous branch-like or root-like appendages. Its body also has two glowing streaks that shine with the same light as its eyes, extending across the length of its body.
Apep's body was originally emerald green in color, but it changed to sand-gray yellow when the divine nail caused the desertification of Sumeru and Apep adapted to the new environment.
Story
History
In the old world, Apep claimed the entirety of Sumeru as its domain and its Heart of Oasis, the source of its power, was an entire world in itself. Elemental lifeforms were born and nurtured in this space, and Apep planned to release its "children" into the world after they matured. However, these dreams never came to fruition due to the arrival of the Primordial One (the Heavenly Principles), which eventually culminated in Apep and the elemental lifeforms' corruption via forbidden knowledge.The Realm of Beginnings
When the Primordial One (the Heavenly Principles) arrived on Teyvat, it stole a portion of the Seven Sovereigns' elemental AuthoritiesCalamitous Tread and remade the world.The Byakuyakoku Collection The Sovereigns attempted to take back the world, and the Dragon King Nibelung brought forbidden knowledge to this world as a countermeasure for the Heavenly Principles' abilities. While they succeeded in gravely wounding the usurper, they still failed to overthrow it and its new order. Apep's immense adaptability allowed it to survive the war and its aftermath; to suppress forbidden knowledge, the Heavenly Principles cast down the divine nails throughout Teyvat, which wreaked havoc on the ecosystems and living beings who lived in the areas where they fell. One fell over what is now Mt. Damavand, transforming the once-lush forests into the Great Red Sand. Apep and its children, including the Wenut, adapted to their environment to survive.Setekh Wenut
Despite the dragons' defeat, Apep refused to give up on achieving what Nibelung could not. Believing forbidden knowledge to be the dragons' only hope in defeating the Heavenly Principles, it made an agreement with King Deshret - who, despite being a god of the Human Realm, also harbored a dream of breaking free from the Heavenly Principles' rules. In exchange for allowing King Deshret to build a grand civilization in its domain, Apep would gain all the knowledge he accumulated, as well as his elemental power, after his death. While this eventually came to pass after Deshret sacrificed himself to stop the spread of the forbidden knowledge he accidentally consumed,Secret of the Scorching Desert Kasala: As long as forbidden knowledge continued to exist, it would forever blight this world. In the end, the proud king of the desert... my eternal lord... Chose to sacrifice himself.Staff of the Scarlet Sands But I do not wish that the poison ingested by mistake should remain in this world. absorbing Deshret's elemental power only served to spread Deshret's forbidden knowledge contamination to Apep itself, and it spent the next few thousand years managing the pain and was unable to analyze any of the knowledge it expected to gain from the venture.
Apep's corruption by forbidden knowledge also took its toll on the primordial elemental lifeforms that resided within it, forcing them to adapt in order to survive. Most morphed into grotesque Proliferating Organisms, driven only by the instinct to consume in order to survive, but a few lucky ones managed to escape with their intelligence intact. Seeking a way to stop what they called the "apocalypse," they spent time adapting to the outside world and took the form of fungus fungi - but as forbidden knowledge took its toll on them, they would eventually transform into Tumors of The Withering as they neared the end of their lives. At some point before the cataclysm, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata took pity on their suffering and promised to bring them salvation one day, allowing them to return "home," and worked with some elemental lifeforms to create the Fire Seed, which would one day be used to restore the Heart of Oasis.
Present Day
Apep is briefly mentioned during the The Temple Where Sand Flows Like Tears, in which Liloupar, a Jinni who lived through King Deshret's era, refers to the Wenut as the "children of Apep."
During the events of Sumeru's Archon Quests, Nahida (Lesser Lord Kusanali) eliminates the forbidden knowledge from Irminsul per the wishes of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies This also purges the forbidden knowledge incorporated into Apep but leaves a large void in its wake, which can only be fixed if primordial elemental energy takes its place. If left alone, the void would cause Apep's massive Dendro elemental power to destabilize and disperse all over Sumeru, causing the rainforest to overgrow and irreversibly disrupt the balance of life.
To avoid such a disaster, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata had created a backup-plan for saving Apep by concentrating a portion of her elemental energy into the Fire Seed, intending for her successor to use it to restore Apep after the cataclysm was dealt with. While Nahida's intervention with Irminsul causes her to temporarily forget about saving Apep, she remembers after investigating the elemental fungi with the Traveler. After learning about the purpose of the Fire Seed, which Nahida had found in the Sanctuary of Surasthana, the party goes to the sandstorm in the middle of the Desert of Hadramaveth to locate Apep.
Apep is initially hostile towards Nahida's offer of help due to its hatred of the gods being amplified by the pain inflicted by forbidden knowledge, but eventually relents after hearing Nahida's heartfelt pleas on behalf of all life, including Apep's own wayward children. Despite its animosity, Apep allows the party to enter the Oasis, but they are separated in the process. When the Fire Seed's elemental energy proves insufficient to restore Apep, Nahida is about to sacrifice herself when the elemental fungi take her place, reverting to their original elemental forms and returning to Apep. Once Nahida and the Traveler subdue the Warden of the Oasis, Apep calms down and reasons that destroying The Seven and humanity serves no purpose. While it still loathes the Heavenly Principles and has no intention of having any further dealings with the gods, Apep tells its story to Nahida and the Traveler and declares its intention to merely observe the world for the time being, then expels them from its body.</text>

<title>Narzissenkreuz Ordo</title>
<text>the place The Narzissenkreuz Ordo
The Narzissenkreuz Ordo was a secret society in Fontaine established over 400 years ago by Rene de Petrichor and Jakob Ingold. It sought to harness the power of the Primordial Sea to merge the wills of countless people into a Descender, thereby surviving the prophesied destruction of Teyvat.
History
The Narzissenkreuz Ordo was established by Rene Rene de Petrichor and Jakob Jakob Ingold of the disbanded Narzissenkreuz Institute, who learned about the coming destruction of the world following the devouring of the Primordial Sea by the All-Devouring Narwhal. They ultimately believed the best way to survive it was merging people's wills into one transcendental being using what they had learned about the Golden Troupe from the ancient Remuria civilization.Canotila and the Book of Revealing Rene gathered followers from the Institute of Natural Philosophy by having Jakob perform certain tricks to convince people to join them.Enigmatic Page (V) They would create their headquarters at a tower in the Morte Region, known as the Tower of Ipsissimus.
Members of the Ordo were given various "clearance" levels, ranging from one to four depending on their work and actions. Honorary clearance levels were provided for those who could not complete a clearance level but had made significant contributions to the Ordo.
Rene visited the Director of the Narzissenkreuz Institute, who had returned to the submerged Institute and remained there after the defeat of Elynas (NPC) Elynas. Rene initially planned to build a new home and bring her over.Enigmatic Page (VII) However, during Rene's subsequent investigation, he changed his mind.Enigmatic Page (VIII) At this point, the Primordial Sea became a research subject for the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, and Jakob's research was later used as the basis for Marcel's own research into manufacturing Sinthe.When All Return to the Waters
Rene believed that the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz embodying "the wills of countless people be concentrated" was necessary, so The Ordo transformed or fused the "Circle of Four Orthants" and a "Tree of Emanation" for this purpose. Rene's plan also required an Oceanid to be involved."...After all, other than the inferior mutants, you can no longer see the original in Fontaine..." He convinced the Director to follow them to the gestalt still under construction, but the director's condition had been deteriorating. Meanwhile, Rene also obtained the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz he had been seeking.Enigmatic Page (IX) Eventually, Rene succeeded in dissolving the Director and using her as a foundation for his experiment, a radical plan to create an Oceanid which would merge the collective consciousness of all Fontainians and prevent the apocalypse. Rene then removed his own personality and was "reborn" as the Master, a fusion of both the Director and Rene himself.
Alain Guillotin and Mary-Ann Guillotin, although also former members of the Narzissenkreuz Institute, did not agree with Rene's methods and refused to join the Ordo. The society was soon deemed an "illegal extremist group", with the local authorities sealing the tower. The Master would eventually remain underneath the tower, in the Primordial Sea where a seal was created to prevent it from spilling out into the surface.
Later on at Elynas, Mary-Ann and the Ordo had a violent clash which left Mary-Ann dead and her mechanical steward Seymour heavily damaged.Limner, Dreamer, and Robotic Dog

<title>Forbidden Zone</title>
<text>The Forbidden Zone It is a secretive area of the Fortress of Meropide. It is built over Primordial Water and has a sluice gate designed to prevent the Primordial Water from flooding Fontaine. There is also a large ship in this area that Wriothesley has been secretly building.
Lore
A year prior to the Traveler's arrival to Fontaine, Wriothesley noticed that the dashboards in the "forbidden zone" were increasing, though he was not certain as to the cause.
Some time after the events of 'As Light Rain Falls Without Reason', Arlecchino sent Lyney, Lynette, and Freminet to the prison to gather information and investigate Childe's disappearance. During the investigation, Lyney revealed that most prisoners would clam up when asked about the forbidden zone. But by talking with the guards, he was able to confirm the existence of it.Fortress of Meropide (Quest)
After the Traveler and Paimon answer some of Wriothesley's riddles about the hidden rules of Meropide, Wriothesley consents to showing them the forbidden zone. In The Duke's Office, he opens a secret stairway leading down to the forbidden zone. There they can see his reconstruction project of the Golden Fortuna.Secret Keepers and Forbidden Zones
Moreover, there are three large isolation doors leading to a room with a sluice gate. The sluice gate was designed to prevent the flooding of primordial water. Ever since Wriothesley became administrator of Meropide, he had been wondering what was beyond the sluice gate. He has also been monitoring the readings on the dashboards.
Freminet attempted to track Childe's route back out to a sewer opening but discovered that the ocean water at the place was diluted with Primordial Water, allowing Wriothesley to deduce that the readings were actually monitoring the levels of Primordial Water and that the prison was built with Egeria's help to stop it from flooding Fontaine.
The Primordial Water had begun mixing with the seawaters around them. Moreover, the "secret" of the forbidden zone is that when many prisoners were exiled to the seaside, they began building the fortress under Egeria's guidance to guard her secret deep beneath the waves. The fortress then became a home for the sinners and more people joined the community. Centuries later, few people remembered the reason why Meropide was founded. Wriothesley learned this from an elderly research historian. As the prophecy says, if the vault gate fails, then Fontaine will be drowned in water, and all will be dissolved into the sea.
Soon after, the water encased behind burst down the sluice gate, but Neuvillette was ultimately able to push back the water and reseal it in the vault for the time being.Calamitous Tread</text>

<title>Takatsukasa Clan</title>
<text>The Takatsukasa Clan is a clan that supports the Kujou Clan in heading the Tenryou Commission. They have a Hidden Mountain Base on Mt. Yougou.
Overview
The Takatsukasa Clan has served the Kujou Clan for several generations. One of its members, Takatsukasa Tokibeitetsu, is the Internal Affairs Head and a Yoriki Samurai who directly serves the Tenryou Commissioner, Kujou Takayuki.Yoriki Samurai note=as 'Takatsukasa Tokibeitetsu' in Tenryou Commission Headquarters (Domain) Tenryou Commission Headquarters
However, the Kujou Clan and Takatsukasa Clan have been at odds for a long time, particularly over the leadership of the Tenryou Commission. A feud between Kujou Takayuki and Takatsukasa Isamu, the former head of the Police Station, resulted in Isamu's murder, for which Ryuuji was scapegoated. Sango and Shikanoin Heizou identified Shiroyama, another member of the Police Station, as the real culprit; Ryuuji was acquitted, while Shiroyama was pressured into committing suicide and Takayuki erased all evidence that could trace Shiroyama's poison back to him.Long-Sealed Mystery
Following the events of 'Omnipresence Over Mortals', the Tenryou Commission was destabilized following revelations about Takayuki's collusion with the Fatui. Eager to claim the position of head of the Tenryou Commission for himself, members of the Takatsukasa Clan attempted to oust the Kujou Clan by coercing Kujou Kamaji into signing a written confession that not only outlined all of the Kujou Clan's corrupt actions, but also falsely painted the Takatsukasa Clan in a positive light. The matter was eventually settled by Ei, who took Kamaji on in a duel and recognized his valor despite his overwhelming loss, and declared that Kamaji would be the temporary head of the Kujou Clan and the head of the Tenryou Commission until she reached her verdict on their fate.To Hear Mortal Hearts The clan also abandoned its hidden mountain base, which later became a Occupied Hold stronghold for Nobushi vagrants.Through the Mist, a Name Unveiled

<title>Ioroi</title>
<text>Ioroi is a Bake-Danuki bake-danuki who lives in Chinju Forest, formerly serving as its protector. He often competed with the Kitsune Saiguu up until her death during the cataclysm 500 years ago.Hakushin Ring Unaware that she had died and believing that she was simply hiding, Ioroi wreaked havoc across Narukami Island in an attempt to lure her out. Instead, he was sealed away by Kamuna Harunosuke, one of the Yougou Three and a former acquaintance of Saiguu's.
Ioroi can be interacted with following the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual series quest 'Tanuki-Bayashi in the Forest'.
Profile
Ioroi was a bake-danuki who dwelt in Chinju Forest and often competed with the Kitsune Saiguu, whom he calls "that sneaky kitsune." One day, for reasons unclear, she decided to play both Ioroi and Ei at the same time; she challenged Ioroi to pluck a Naku Weed from the Tenshukaku garden. Beelzebul caught him in the act, however, and nearly slew him. He was saved by the Kitsune Saiguu's intervention, who pleaded on his behalf and persuaded the Archon to put Ioroi under her command as Protector of the Grove.
Five hundred years ago, the cataclysm struck Teyvat. The Kitsune Saiguu decided to protect Ioroi from the dark forces by tricking him into hiding via a game of hide-and-seek. Afterwards, she went to battle and eventually died in the conflict. Ioroi, unaware of the full extent of the strife, simply believed she was still playing the game. When his usual antics failed to cause her to emerge, he began going around breaking the kitsune statues and, in one of them, found a comb used for the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual. Deciding it was probably important to Saiguu, but unaware of what it was used for, Ioroi took it.
The Inazuma Shogunate learned of Ioroi's actions and dispatched Kamuna Harunosuke, an onmyouji who had returned from Liyue after departing for several years following Saiguu's death, to deal with the bake-danuki. Harunosuke ultimately sealed Ioroi and many of the bake-danuki away into stone statues to teach them a "lesson."Sacrificial Offering
Sometime later, the Traveler would discover Ioroi after being tasked with helping Hanachirusato with cleaning the filth from the Sacred Sakura but required the comb that he originally had. Ioroi, believing them to be a fellow tanuki, began directing the Traveler to him. Upon learning that he had been leading a human, he panicked and sent a group of hilichurls to drive them off. The Traveler easily routed them and Ioroi learned that they were looking for the comb and agreed to give it to them as long as they found some of his fellow tanuki and played with them, learning why they needed it in the first place and sent Kichiboushi to help direct them to the location.
During their travels, Paimon remembered about Ioroi and convinced the Traveler to pay him a visit. Ioroi was initially terrified of their presence before quickly recognizing them. He told them that prior to being petrified, he saw a larger mountain across the ocean on the peak of Mt. Yougou which the Traveler recognized as Dragonspine. As he had been subsisting on reports from the bake-danuki that were not petrified, he did not know much about the world outside of Inazuma. He then asked them to bring Kichiboushi around Teyvat to help him train, telling the bake-danuki to follow the Traveler's instructions as he wished to appoint him as his successor when he was older.

<title>Red-Haired Warrior</title>
<text>The red-haired warrior was a key member in the rebellion against Decarabian in Decarabian's Mondstadt Old Mondstadt. He was friends with the Nameless Bard, the wind spirit who would become Barbatos, Amos,Should You Be Trapped in a Windless Land note=CinematicAmos' Bow and an unnamed knight (possibly Gunnhildr).Freedom-Sworn
Profile
The red-haired warrior was a wanderer and eventually came to live in Old Mondstadt under Decarabian's dictatorial rule. Discontent with the god's reign, he was one of the first to plan the resistance against the God of Storms and used the secret sign of Windblume to communicate with like-minded people.Windblume Ode
Around 2,600 years ago, with the aid of Gunnhildr and the Gunnhildr Clan,Biography of Gunnhildr a full-scale rebellion rose up in Mondstadt. Alongside the Nameless Bard, the wind spirit, Amos, and the knight, he stormed the terror and confronted Decarabian personally. Decarabian was slain in the ensuing battle, but the Bard and Amos were fatally wounded as well; the knight props up the Bard as they witness the fall of the old god.
With the death of an old god in the midst of the Archon War, and with Decarabian's rival Andrius choosing to pass over the position, the elf was selected as one of The Seven Archons and ascended to godhood, assuming the name Barbatos and the form of the late Bard. For reasons not completely clear, the red-haired warrior then turned his back on Barbatos.
It is heavily implied that the Ragnvindr Clan are his descendants, though the clan takes its name from Ragnvindr, who - like the red-haired warrior - raised the flag of rebellion against the tyrannical aristocracy 1,600 years after the fall of Old Mondstadt.
Appearance
The red-haired warrior has similarities with Diluc or the other Ragnvindr; he has a long red hair and fur-coat leather coat with a red gem on the ascot. He has a small red goatee.</text>

<title>Shikanoin Heizou/Lore</title>
<text>A young prodigy detective from the Tenryou Commission. His senses are sharp and his thoughts are ingenious. No matter what unsolved case he's facing, he can get to the truth in unexpected ways.
Personality
A young prodigy detective from the Tenryou Commission. His senses are sharp and his thoughts are clear.
In Heizou's youth, he was rebellious and disliked following rules.Kano Nana Despite calling himself a detective and serving the Tenryou Commission, his investigations revolve around his personal principles and appear to be unrelated to any governmental duty. Heizou's view of the term "detective" mostly stems from his belief that one should be evil's natural enemy, as the damage had already been done despite any attempt to cover it. This caused him to split with Sango. Despite appearing "brainy" to many, Heizou is one of the Tenryou Commission's strongest doushins, being a very skilled martial artist; despite this, he is not very fond of having to fight, as he considers apprehending criminals in that manner blunt.
His superior, Kujou Sara, dislikes him for this but keeps him nonetheless as he always brings back results. In Thoma's words, Heizou is "not the easiest person to get along with" despite his happy disposition. He enjoys fried food of all sorts.
Appearance
Spirited Valor
Heizou uses the Medium Male Characters medium male model. He has burgundy hair with a dark highlight, light olive green eyes, and a mole below each eye.
Official Introduction
Shikanoin Heizou:Even the most seamless cloak fears an unexpected cold wind.
Doushin Shikanoin has admirable wit and insight. While he is unfettered and unrestrained in demeanor, one should not dismiss his talents. The Tenryou Commission is incredibly fortunate to have such a man in their ranks.
A young detective from the Tenryou Commission. Free-spirited and unruly, but cheerful and lively.
At first glance, Heizou seems like an ordinary young man, but he is actually the undisputed number one detective in the Tenryou Commission.
Not only does he possess a wild imagination, but he also has a mind for meticulous logic and reasoning, as well as an extraordinary sense of intuition when it comes to solving cases.
Whenever a crime occurs, his colleagues rely on experience to help them with handling the case, but Heizou brings in an out-of-the-box perspective and gets straight to the crux of the case.
People are impressed by his razor-sharp intuition, thinking that his reasoning ability and efficiency are godlike. Here, Heizou would simply reply with his signature smile: "I don't know, maybe this is something that even the gods can't do!"
Character Stories
Shikanoin Heizou is an extraordinary young detective.Though working at the Tenryou Commission, he is at odds with the usual impression of a public servant, who is expected to be "stern," "solemn"... and "solemn" again.On the outside, he appears more well-behaved and polite than any other new hires, but on the inside, he is actually thumbing his nose at all the official mumbo jumbo.Unlike his colleagues, he does not go to the Station to report for duty on a daily basis and rarely shows up for any routine patrols.It can seem like ages since you last saw him, and you may finally chance upon him at some crime scene. Yet, judging by that ever-present grin, you can hardly tell if he is actually there working.Funnily enough, all his "unorthodox behaviors as a public servant" are somewhat acquiesced to.His colleagues are more than willing to work with him and his boss seldom criticizes him for being this unfettered.Even his boss's boss inquires after him every now and then.All this can be safely chalked up to his unrivaled prowess as a detective.Whenever the Tenryou Commission is tackling an unusually complicated case, be it a major one or a mysterious one, everyone regards Heizou as their last hope to crack the code.Even the head of the Police Station marvels at his extensive experience in solving cases, but Heizou himself has a different opinion about that."Experience is another name for people's past mistakes, and that's not my trump card.""My trump card is something I was born with."
Joining the Tenryou Commission is no easy task. Not only do you have to pass the ability test, but also a thorough background check.Therefore, candidates are usually required to declare some essential information, such as any valuable property.According to Yoriki Owada, who was in charge of the check at the time, when Heizou applied, he handed in nothing but a blank declaration form.It was a bright and sunny morning. Sitting opposite Owada, Heizou was curiously exploring the place with his eyes. Owada, who had been around the block by then, spent a moment deciphering the blank form, then looked up and insinuated,"I've met many brilliant young people. However, it's a shame that none of them made it to the Station in the end."Hearing this, all of a sudden, that seemingly hyperactive young man stopped looking around, sat up straight, and looked Owada in the eye."Right. How about a young person like me?"His switching happened so fast that Yoriki Owada was suddenly stunned, feeling like prey in the sights of some hawk-eyed predator.Out of nowhere, a strange sensation came over him, as if at that moment, he was the one being scrutinized.He said jokingly then, as though it would steady his nerves,"The Tenryou Commission does not discriminate against the poor. But if you have literally nothing to declare, then we'll make sure we pay extra attention to your background."It was followed by an unexpected silence. The one sitting opposite looked straight at him without saying a word, just as before.Owada wasn't feeling his best, his forehead slightly twitching. Maybe it was too hot. He made to wipe off the sweat with the back of his hand.However, there was no sweat on his forehead at all. Owada stared blankly at the dry back of his hand, not knowing if he should wipe again or put his hand down.The young man burst out into laughter upon seeing this. His hearty laughter immediately relieved Owada from his overwhelmed state.Heizou just leaned on the table with his chin in one hand, pointing to his head with the other. He smiled at Owada and said,"Other than my genius, I have nothing to declare."
The Tenryou Commission is in fact not where Heizou started his career as a detective.Before all this happened, Heizou once owned an agency called "Bantan Sango & Heizou Detective Agency."It was what was to become Bantan Sango Detective Agency in Inazuma City now, which was actually co-founded by Heizou and Sango in the beginning.The story of the two started with them striking an instant chord with each other, only to end with them regretfully parting ways.After the breakdown of their partnership, Heizou's name, naturally, was taken down from the old business.As for the reason behind it all, it can probably all be summed up as "they had different visions."Sango believes that a detective's entire mission is to uncover the truth, which is something of utmost significance. Most detectives also hold this belief dear to their hearts.But Heizou reckons there's more to it. That there might be something that's even more vital than the truth.Years of experience working as a detective have made him aware that when a new case comes to him, that means something unfortunate has already happened.No matter how the criminals are punished for their evil conduct afterward, it cannot change the fact that someone has already been hurt.Similarly, no matter how skilled a doctor is, they will never be able to treat a patient and pretend that nothing ever happened, telling them,"Look, all your wounds have healed, as if you were never wounded in the first place."The truth is from then on, whenever the patient sees a doctor, sees an infirmary, or sees the scars left by the operation, they will be reminded every time of all the wounds that were once on their body, hurting them.Doctors are helpless to prevent violent actions from being executed somewhere. Detectives cannot stop new cases from emerging. But Heizou hopes to break this status quo once and for all."If I can't nip evil in the bud, then I shall be its natural enemy.""The name of Shikanoin Heizou will be renowned throughout the world and intimidate anyone with malicious intent all across Teyvat.""They will realize one thing. Once they submit to the darkness, I will hunt them down to the ends of the earth."It was at that point that he made his decision to leave the agency and join the Tenryou Commission.It was the starting point for him to become the "detective" he seeks to be.
"I've read in the novels that every great detective has an assistant, just like every katsudon has a pork cutlet."At the Police Station, the new recruit Uesugi approached Heizou with a big smile on his face."So, Heizou, what do you think? Can I be your assistant? I'm very clever."Heizou eyed this chirpy young man up with a grin, then rubbed his chin and replied,"My intuition tells me that you are not that clever.""Huh? May... maybe your intuition is wrong."The sentence Uesugi just uttered seemed to have some magic to it as if it were a closing joke made at the end of a comedy. On hearing that, his nearby senior colleagues all laughed like a supportive audience.The clever Uesugi immediately realized that he had said something inappropriate, so he tried to patch his statement up."What I meant is... we can't just rely solely on intuition in our line of work!"Unexpectedly, everyone laughed even harder this time. Uesugi, not comprehending what had happened, thought to himself that maybe he should really consider being a comedian.At that moment, Heizou brushed his shoulder as if to remove the awkwardness along with the dust."I was just joking. Actually, my intuition tells me that you, Uesugi, are going to be an excellent Doushin.""And so, I suggest that you find your own assistant should you have the time."No sooner had Heizou finished his sentence than he had run away like the wind, leaving a still-baffled Uesugi and his guffawing colleagues behind...."You've still got a long way to go before you can be Doushin Shikanoin's assistant.""I was just trying to help since I noticed that he has no assistant...""Of course he does. He mentioned his assistant many times.""What?! Has he?""Didn't you hear him say 'my intuition tells me' multiple times?""Huh?! Are you saying... that his assistant is... his intuition?!""Exactly! That guy can solve cases merely with his intuition. Isn't that wild?"
When it comes to performance, Heizou should've been promoted many a time, considering all his achievements.However, in reality, Heizou has been a Doushin ever since he joined the Tenryou Commission.On the other hand, many among his colleagues and superiors have risen through the ranks as a by-product of his achievements.After Heizou's cousin, Kano Nana, heard about it, she came to Heizou and determined to stand up for him."You may be a brat, but this unfair treatment you've suffered is way worse.""I'm going to give those goons a piece of my mind!"Heizou knew his cousin very well, so to save her from any trouble, Heizou patiently explained the reasons behind this situation - a rare thing for him."Cuz, don't consider me lesser than them.""Wanna take a guess at how many inmates at the Police Station Jail can name the Yoriki?"Heizou spread his fingers of one hand, palm facing her. "This number at most."Having no idea what he was getting at, Kano Nana replied hesitantly, "Five?""What about the ones who can name this genius detective right in front of you?"Heizou spread his fingers of the other hand, this time palm facing himself, "This many at least.""Five again? What's the difference?"Heizou laughed, "Cuz, I'm talking about the number of hairs on my hands!""Just like we have no hair on our palms, none of the inmates can name all the Yoriki.""But the inmates who can name me are as many as the hairs on the back of my hand!""Now that my influence has far exceeded that of those Yoriki, what's in it for me to get promoted?""On the contrary, staying close to the front line means that more criminals will be intimidated by the name of Shikanoin Heizou - that's my ultimate goal.""So don't worry about me, cuz. I have never strayed, and I will never stray from my path!"
Just as Heizou claims, the most well-known name at the Police Station Jail is not that of any Yoriki, or even that of the General of the Tenryou Commission... But is instead the name of Doushin Shikanoin Heizou.Here, at least, even the name of the Raiden Shogun herself might be lesser in stature compared to his.After all, none of these criminals, great or small, have ever been personally nabbed by the Shogun, but a great many of them are surely here on Heizou's account.This is how things panned out:It started with some arrogant crooks boasting while temporarily out from behind bars of how elite their criminal skills were and how they had sent government officials off on wild goose chases, seeking to gain the admiration of their fellows.But when asked why they were caught in spite of their great skills, they would often blame, through clenched teeth, the matter on "that detective.""Not that I didn't try, mind you, but he's just too cunning!"Thus did the detective's name spread throughout the prison.Even later on, the situation would again change when the criminals discovered that the detective who caught them was someone named "Shikanoin Heizou."It was one thing if a single detective could catch some skilled crooks. Perhaps he was just a good detective.But if countless high-level criminals were seized by this one man, then surely he could not be an ordinary person.In that moment, everyone present imagined something similar.A trickster god in the guise of humanity, scheming and cunning beyond compare, seeing into the hearts of mortals with contemptuous ease.Why, a change of sides would see such a fellow become the greatest criminal in history!Those who were unwilling to take part in further affray spoke no more, while even the most hardened and wicked amongst them secretly thought:"It might be best not to take him on, or to speak more ill about him than we should."Even the fiercest criminal lords no longer use his name even when they wish to boast, instead using the pseudonym "Cyclone."When the Doushin on guard duty heard this new title, they would ask what it meant.And some petty criminals would reply, "A calamity! A plague upon all us crooks!"
The way Heizou sees it, detectives are to destroy their opponents' defenses using their intelligence.Using force to subdue criminals is, inevitably, the inferior way of doing things, and so Heizou does his best to avoid this in his daily work.As such, his reputation at the Police Station was, for the longest time, one of a brainy but dainty character.Thus, everyone was all too sure that he would be in for a tough time at the internal martial arts contest held by the Station.This would be a no-holds-barred contest: neither limitations on schools nor restrictions of weapons would hold any sway here. The only rule was that the one to knock their opponent from a fifty-pace ring would triumph.To everyone's shock, however, the "brainy" Heizou would show up to this contest without using Vision, and he carried no weapon but his two bare fists, which in turn carried him to the final.During that match, Kujou Sara, who had arrived upon hearing rumors of his prowess, assessed that the match was over even before it began."Doushin Shikanoin moves lightly and his fists are the match of any weapon. It would be hard to match him in melee - and only a skilled bowman would triumph."As she predicted, Heizou's opponent would concede defeat after taking seventeen punches to the left side, with only a streak of Heizou's hair sliced off to show for it.But just as he was about to be crowned champion, Kujou Sara herself walked into the ring and picked up a training bow, requesting a match with Heizou.There was a brief uproar. Most of the people participating in the tournament were rather junior Doushin, and no one had expected that General Kujou herself would attend.Heizou narrowed his eyes. He had originally only come to test his skills, such that he might not be found wanting in the extreme situations where his wits alone would not be sufficient.But at this moment, his blood was up and the spirit of competition had descended on him like it often does on youths, and so he gladly accepted. In a flash, the atmosphere heated up and everyone was flushed with excitement."Great going, Heizou!" Doushin Uesugi yelled from the stands, Yoriki Owada quietly pumping a fist from beside him.After a moment's preparation, both parties entered the ring. The rules were slightly different this time: neither of them would use their Visions. This would only be a contest at fifty paces between Sara's arrow and Heizou's fists. Whoever touched the other first with their weapon would be declared the victor.The atmosphere by now was practically bursting at the seams. The battle was about to begin. Yet few realized that in a battle between experts, each move was peril itself, and that the match would be ended in a single shot.Sara let fly, and fifty paces away, Heizou was seen with his right hand clenched in front of his chest, tightly gripping an arrow that quivered but two finger-widths from his heart like a striking serpent."It's my loss. What a frighteningly fast shot," Heizou said with a laugh, before throwing the arrow aside. "There was no time to evade, General, so I was forced to touch your weapon.""I won by dint of the rules alone. I have met very few who could catch one of my arrows barehanded. I doubt the result would be so certain, were this a real battle."Sara's eyes glimmered as she spoke such praise."Doushin Shikanoin, you are skilled in both mind and hand. You will do great things, should you be more disciplined."...Half a month later, a champion's medal specially made by the Tenryou Commission arrived at the Grand Narukami Shrine, along with a handwritten note."Here's a little something, cuz, for you to give to my old man when you've got the time. Y'know, just to let him know that I haven't completely made a mess of his teachings and all."
Heizou mentions his childhood very little, for it was not a happy one.He was born in a remote village where his ancestry was rather prominent and his father was a martial artist of some small repute.But just like every other rebellious child in the world, he only wished to escape having to take up his father's work, even as he was forced to learn martial arts alongside him.This state of affairs would persist until Heizou made a friend who claimed to be from a wealthy merchant family at a festival.This friend was a bright and agile mind, and would often bring all manner of new gadgets for Heizou to play with, saying that they were from his family's storehouse.Books from Sumeru, mysterious toys from Fontaine of all sorts... These toys injected significant vibrance into Heizou's otherwise monotonous life.The friends grew closer as they grew older, but Heizou also began to notice a problem.His friend's clothes were always filthy, hardly the sort of image a rich merchant's son should have.He thus decided to have an honest talk with his friend. They would have a conversation like proper adults.Unexpectedly, his friend immediately admitted to having deceived him, and even confessed that all the gifts he had given Heizou were stolen from the local merchant's guild.He even went so far as to relate that he had originally met Heizou at the festival with the intention to steal some valuables from the latter, only for them to have become friends instead.He laughed as he confessed these matters, as if this was some interesting tale.Heizou was furious, though he knew not what he was angry at: was he angry at having been deceived by his best friend? Or was it because his best friend was a criminal?Regardless, he reprimanded his friend harshly: "We're not friends anymore!"Fuming, he returned home, sought out each and every item he had been given, and threw them all out, till nothing but a single green pebble remained.This was one of a pair of "treasures" the two of them had fished out from a small stream, and each of them had taken one. This item alone was not tainted by theft, and was perhaps purer even than their friendship.Gazing upon it, Heizou hardened his heart and threw it out the window... only for it to strike the window lattice and come flying back, rolling under his bed.Now irate, and seeing how even the heavens were conspiring against him in this endeavor, Heizou, in a fit of growing pique, dumped himself on the ground like a frog with a punctured belly, refusing to move.Looking at the ceiling despondently, he told himself that he would one day put these ill things out of his mind. Yet the world is such that the more we wish to forget things, the more they shall refuse to be forgotten.A year later, when the festival where he and his friend first met rolled back around, Heizou happened to rediscover the pebble, and had it on him as he traveled to attend the festival.He knew not what he was expecting, but fate already had an answer on hand... though it was not the one Heizou expected.Heizou would meet his friend again that day, collapsed by the roadside in a pool of his own blood amidst the screams of the crowd.Just a moment earlier, his friend had gotten into an altercation with a ruffian who had angled to steal his Mora purse, and who then in a panic had plunged a dagger into his heart.Heizou dashed over to check on his old friend, the pebble in his hand falling by the wayside. Catching sight of it, his friend's dull eyes lit up just a little."Come here to see me, did you... Heizou?"Heizou tried to keep pressure over his good friend's chest, but the blood kept seeping through his fingers, and he was again filled with fury, even more so than the year prior."Just shut up! Shut up!" He yelled at his friend.His friend shook his head, and with great effort opened his purse. There was not a single Mora inside - nothing but the green pebble that had belonged to him.Squeezing the last ounce of his strength out, he held the pebble out to Heizou with a smile broader than when they had parted."I... I came to see you, too..."...Heizou did not recall how he had returned home. His mind was blank, filled with nothing but rage and disgust.But in that moment, his intuition told him that he felt rage and disgust at a certain thing, and that he and it had always been foes.This thing had mixed deception into friendship, and it had caused life to be cut short before its time. "Sin." That was its name.But it was not his friend's sin of deception or theft, nor was it the murder that the thief committed. It was something more abstract, something of a higher order.It was the culmination of all the sins in this world, hovering over all like a titanic shadow covering the skies, fixing its cold and unfeeling gaze on all that was good in this world, and seeking ways to snuff it out.One morning, one month later, Heizou sneaked out of doors to travel afar, leaving a farewell note behind. He had found his enemy, and he would now embark on a journey to make war against it.Accompanying him on this journey was a green stone, but it was not the pebble that symbolized friendship, but instead a Vision that stood for his resolve.

<title>Kamisato Ayato/Lore</title>
<text>Current head of the Kamisato Clan and, accordingly, the Yashiro Commissioner. He always has a way of attaining his purpose in a well-thought-out manner. However, few people understand what that "goal" he holds most dear is.
Personality
The young but highly accomplished head of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan. Cultured and polite, he is a man of many ways and means.
Ayato is a person that does not like to show his face in public often, preferring to work on his duties as the Yashiro Commissioner. A well-known fact about him is that he's extremely busy and stressed, as he has to deal with corrupt government officials while juggling his duty as the leader of the Shuumatsuban. Due to his duties, he loathes small talk, wanting people to get to the point. He uses a large array of methods to deal with corrupt officials, usually within legal bounds.
While he is not particularly well known due to his preference to remain behind the scenes, those who are familiar with him note that he is incredibly kind and has inspired loyalty from many people. For example, Hirotatsu states that he continues to serve the Yashiro Commission to repay the generosity that he showed him and his master and it is strongly implied that Ayato was the one who inspired Thoma to the point the latter received a Vision. Ayato has stated that he highly values loyalty and obedience (hence his preference for dogs), as strongly implied that there were numerous assassinations against him in the past, hence why he values those two traits so much to protect himself from rival clans and organizations.YouTube:
Despite his succession as the family head at a young age, he appears to be a mature and determined man, notably even more than Ayaka, who's known for her steadfastness. Like Ayaka, Ayato cares for the well-being of the common people. He is also a family man, as he had taken the position of Commissioner per his parents' wishes to also protect Ayaka, stating that he would not forgive any who would harm his family and wanting to ensure that Ayaka had others to rely on when she needed it.The Wind Settles He also risked his life to smuggle the Watatsumi Army into Tenshukaku for the sake of doing a "small favor" for her.
Ayato is also known to be cunning and mischievous, as both Raiden Shogun the Shogun and Yae Miko note him as unpredictable and tricky to understand, with the latter strongly disliking him as a result. Nonetheless, he is tolerated by both for upholding the Shogun's will for the former and their duties generally aligning for the latter. Hiratsuka notes that whenever he hangs out with Thoma, he ropes him into eating strange food, causing Thoma to become terrified whenever he sees him. Itto remarks that Ayato is a "warrior" with great charisma, and that the two are "on the same wavelength". He is also able to find Sayu with ease despite not appearing to have much ninja training, even though the rest of the Shuumatsuban have difficulty locating her.
Appearance

Ayato uses the Tall Male Characters tall male model. He has long pale blue asymmetrical shoulder-length hair, pale skin, and light purple eyes. He also has a small mole under the left corner of his mouth.
Official Introduction
Kamisato Ayato:Pillar of fortitude, a new branch of emerald glory
The game of politics is fraught with peril. Saying too little is not good, but saying too much is also bad. But don't get me wrong, my Lord does not take any joy in these 'battles.' For him, it's just... a matter of duty.
As the head of the Yashiro Commission, Kamisato Ayato is committed to maintaining the prosperity and stability of the region.
At a glance, he is low-profile and graceful. He is not a fan of public appearances and does not seek to show his skills overtly.
But those who do know him understand that he is not to be underestimated. Long ago, when the Yashiro Commission fell on hard times, and when the Kamisato Clan was on the verge of crumbling, it was this young man who rose to the occasion and stabilized the situation.
He could not have achieved his position without extraordinary resourcefulness and cunning. But perhaps, that impenetrable smile belies darker waves.
However, the most intriguing thing is that in most of these negotiations in which he participates, he is not ruthless nor competitive, and is even willing to share the benefits so that everyone can get a relatively satisfactory piece of the pie.
"What exactly is he up to?" is usually what people are thinking after all is said and done.
However, now that everyone has a piece of that pie, perhaps what is on Kamisato Ayato's mind isn't so important.
Character Stories
As clan head of the Kamisato Clan, one of the great clans of the Tri-Commission, Kamisato Ayato is a household name in Inazuma.However, people do not have quite the same clear impression of him as they do of the Shirasagi Himegimi, the elegant and kind Ayaka.Most only know that he is an important figure in the Shogunate and the head of a famed noble house. But as for the details, there's little that they can say for sure.Some people say that "the Yashiro Commission's festivals and events are ever meticulous and have been full of consideration for the people. Surely the Commissioner's hand is in all such matters."But others also say "ah, but there is much to politics that should never see the light of day. And how could he have kept such a lofty position without a few tricks up his sleeve, hmm?"Ayato himself is unfazed by such comments."Well, I consider myself merely a serious, dutiful public servant who owes his allegiance to the Raiden Shogun Almighty Shogun."
Kamisato Ayato, as the eldest son of Inazuman nobility, was greatly loved from the moment he was born.Though his parents were too busy to always spend time with him, they took good care of him, and in any case the "young master" never lacked for people around to look after his every need.When he was somewhat older, he would, at his father's request, begin a complex and strict training regimen as the family successor.But not all went as well as they might have hoped, and the pressures in the court and at home would weigh heavily on his father's health, resulting in an early passing.The young Ayato was thus thrust into a battle for the survival of the clan's position.In those days, none were impressed by this inexperienced youngster. Ayato went from being an elegant and refined princeling to "the poor young master of the Kamisato Clan" amongst the people, and "that greenhorn" amongst his political opponents.Time, however, would prove these people wrong.With extraordinary courage and some first-rate tactics, he did not leave the clan to languish. No, indeed, the Kamisato Clan's position would grow more stable than ever.The heavy workload, malicious deceptions, and attempts to frame him at every turn he parried away, even turning them to his own advantage.The passage of time has only increased the standing of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan in the Shogunate and with the people.Today, Ayato is a clan head that a great house like the Kamisato Clan would be proud of, and a Yashiro Commissioner acknowledged by all.
The Yashiro Commission is in charge of ritual matters on Narukami Island, and must also attend to matters of cultural leisure in such a manner that deities and the people alike are pleased - and they do, honoring their commission.But with greater responsibilities come greater amounts of work.Fortunately, his sister Ayaka shares much of the clan's responsibilities, with most of the interactions between the Commission and the people falling to her, allowing Ayato to spend most of his time on matters of governance.Dealing with Shogunate officials is no easy matter. People come from different Commissions and clans, and their perspectives are very different. Any single task grows harder as the number of people involved grows.Ayato's great strength lies in his ability to handle such matters. The way he sees it, people are driven by interest. Find leverage, and the other side will cooperate.Find some goal that will bring the other party around to your logic, then pacify them with a few choice platitudes for the occasion, and most problems can be resolved.And when dealing with the stubborn, one merely needs to appeal to a higher power to bear - after all, what mortal could gainsay the light of heaven itself, no matter how high their status or arrogant their attitude?Over time, the knowledgeable and decorous Kamisato clan head gained quite the name for himself in the Shogunate."Hmm... this matter seems quite hard to handle. Should we ask the Yashiro Commissioner?"So people would often say.However, while Ayato is indeed full of ways and means, he will not simply help at any given moment.Firstly, not every task is related to the Yashiro Commission. Secondly, it is simply not worth it for the Kamisato Clan to get itself involved for the sake of others' petty profit.Mostly, Ayato will simply tag along as a junior figure, teacup in hand, doing little more than smiling."Ah, come now, Sir Nagaoka Hidemitsu Nagaoka. We are all loyal servants of the Almighty Shogun. Nothing more to it. We just need to be open with each other, and I'm sure we can resolve this issue together."
Being limited by his station and work, Ayato does not often appear in public, nor does he have much time for any sort of leisurely walk. However, these obstacles cannot hinder him from learning of new and interesting things.Perhaps in the morning, he might spy one of the Yae Publishing House staff poking her head around the place, seemingly here to "report for work." In which case, he may as well pretend not to notice, all the better to hear what new methods she has for skipping work... and then "accidentally" let slip his newfound knowledge to Guuji Yae.In a meeting with those old fogeys at Tenshukaku, there is no need to speak too quickly. After all, watching grown people argue till they are red in the face over petty issues is quite amusing.While walking through the streets, he might suddenly consider a certain unique snack stand. Going up to the owner, he'd ask if they are selling anything new, how business is going, buy a drink or two to try... and if he finds it interesting, he'll buy a few back for the rest of the household.Lately, he also lent some encouragement to the Arataki Itto young oni who frequents Hanamizaka due to the latter's bug-fighting troubles - out of the goodness of his heart, of course. He also discovered that this crimson oni did not know what the name "Ayato" signified... which was fine, of course. No need to explain such things.On the way home, he might pass Chinju Forest and see passers-by having tricks played on them by the bake-danuki, in which case he will point the illusion out. If the bake-danuki should hone their changeling skills further on his account, why, they should thank him for the inspiration.And of course, even one so talented as Thoma might sometimes struggle to think of what to make for dinner. Such occasions are perfect for a hot pot game! After all, Ayaka always puts the most unexpected things into the pot - and how proud he is of his sister for that!Yes, these things are indeed the spice of the Yashiro Commissioner's life.
Between the butler and the housekeeper, the Kamisato estate is always spick and span, inside and out... except for one location.Kamisato Ayato's table is always a terrible mess after he uses it.Books are strewn about, open and even dumped face-down on the table, while documents of uneven size are stacked haphazardly. The ink on the inkstone is never really properly kept, and one might even sometimes find chess pieces or cards under the table.Each time the clan head gets off work, the servants always need some time to clean his study up.In the process, they discovered that assorted notes are often clipped between these pages. Upon closer inspection, they are written in different hands, and their content also varies."Clan Head, the servants have sent a new batch of flowers. I have placed them in a flower vase in a corner of the table. Please take care not to knock it over again.""Clan Head, a shrine maiden from the Grand Narukami Shrine came over today, saying that the Lady Guuji wishes to see you. It seems important, as it involves the requisitioning of land in Ritou. She invites you to the Shrine to discuss the details.""Lord Commissioner, the Momoyo flowers have not withered. The branches grow yet. Do not worry.""Dear Brother, I learned a new recipe while attending festivities with the Traveler. Considering that she is from another land, do you think... that I might need to make some changes to said recipe?""Clan Head, the servants have been reluctant to tell you this, so allow Furuta this old lady to say it. If you wish to eat something, please leave it to our Thoma housekeeper. Also, please refrain from using the ingredients in the kitchen... How could we make you cook for yourself, after all?"Ayato's work often sees him leaving home early and returning late. As such, the people of the Kamisato Estate will communicate with him through these means.This was a method that Ayato came up with himself, and this is how the Kamisato household is run, via these small notes.Unfortunately, their use has seen the clan head's already messy table become messier still... Oh well, just a small sacrifice. Nothing worth writing home about.
In Inazuma, people will sometimes pray to deities by offering certain kinds of cypress leaves.But as such rituals lack scale, they are often forgotten amidst the many, both large and small, that are conducted throughout the land.Though some time has passed, Ayato still remembers his Kamisato Kayo mother mentioning that though these cypresses are evergreen, their leaves are not needle-like.Instead, they have large, crisp leaves that will not wither and fall even when new ones grow.As such, it is associated with the concept of "prosperity," and was often used in ancient times as ritual plating for food offerings.Today, people no longer use leaves as mats upon which to spread food, but the habit of offering cypress leaves persists nonetheless.Perhaps it was just a hobby of hers, or perhaps she was just well-read in general, but whatever the case, his mother always had a great deal to say about festival affairs."Perhaps the Kamisato Clan of the Yashiro Commission were born to protect the deities."In his younger years, Ayato had not fully agreed with this statement.He believed that the Kamisato Clan was the Kamisato Clan, and that it belonged to the family's members. That was the reason for its existence, and any service to the gods was a job, a matter of circumstance.But such presumptuous words could never be said out loud, and in any case, Ayato could not bear to interrupt his mother when she looked so excited.No matter how long she would go on, Ayato would always sit in front of her and listen in silence, even if his legs might fall asleep in the process.With the passing of years, Ayato's days would be taken up by swordsmanship and books. The one giving the "lessons" was now his father, and the lesson content would turn from ritual affairs to matters that the clan's successor should be concerned with.His duty to the clan would be something that would occupy yet more space in Ayato's life. Nor was the Raiden Shogun just a mere symbol as she was in his childhood. Now, she was the Ogosho, the mighty defender of Inazuma's eternal peace."The Kamisato Clan stands today because of Narukami's mercy. As such, the Clan must defend the road to Eternity, and follow the Shogun eternally.""This was our agreement, and it is the unchanging rule of our clan. Remember this well."As for the specifics of what happened, Ayato had already gleaned some of them from reading their ancestral teachings. It was the Kamisato elders' failings that had resulted in the nationally-important Raiden Gokaden to suffer great loss. If not for Guuji Yae's intervention on their behalf, causing the Shogun to show them mercy, the Kamisato Clan may have joined others in falling from grace and ceasing to exist.This was the grace of Her Excellency, and at the same time, it was a warning from Her servant.As such, Ayato never snubbed his father's teachings. Though he still believed in protecting his clan above all else, he also understood that Inazuma was sustained by the Electro Archon's protection. Only peace in Inazuma could guarantee the longevity and prosperity of the clan.No matter how things might change in Inazuma, the Kamisato Clan alone would never betray the Almighty Narukami.Even if his heart said differently, he could only bury it deep beneath well-maintained appearances.Just as his mother said back then-"The divinely-protected cypress will sprout new leaves from ancient branches.So, too, can the camellia in the courtyard remain fragrant even in the most bitter winter."
Even Kamisato Ayato himself could not have expected that calligraphy practice, which he had found most boring in his youth, would eventually become a favored pastime of his.He had slogged through much penmanship practice to better play the part of the Kamisato Clan's eldest son.But nowadays, he transcribes a few poems from time to time to clear his mind and think in silence.Of course, this also lets him seem like he is busy with official business even while idle, all the better to avoid seeing some people and doing certain things.With time's passing, it became agreed among the servants waiting on him that he not only liked to play chess but was also fond of calligraphy.Such talk would spread widely via word of mouth. As such, Ayato often receives excellent brushes as gifts during festivals or birthdays.Some of the more speculative have even bought him exquisite and expensive quill pens from overseas.Ayato has never attempted to clarify this matter, but instead had a lovely wooden case made in which he stores such stationery.He has always been interested in all things new, and trying out these new pens is indeed fun.Moreover, these gifts often say much about the person who sent them. Such information thus becomes one of the means by which Ayato can get a handle on them.That said, though he claims to have bought this case to store stationery, there are three pens that Ayato has never placed inside it.One of them, slim and well-crafted, is placed on his desk. It shows signs of some wear and tear, but it writes well, and is used for writing petitions.The second is stored in a drawer at the bottom, its fine tip having seen much loving use in the past when Ayato was practicing calligraphy. Its beginner-friendly nature also saw it borrowed quite often by Thoma and Ayaka back in the day.As for the third, it is stored deep within a wooden cabinet used to store antiques, sealed within a silk bag. Excellent of make and design, it was presented to him by his mother during his adulthood ceremony.
One night, many years ago, Ayato's gravely-ill father summoned him into his presence.That night, his father seemed a little different from the illness-weathered figure he had become. His expression was solemn, and yet the concern in his eyes was all too clear.Forcing himself to stay alert, he asked Ayato: was his training done? Had he eaten enough for dinner? How was his swordsmanship progressing?As Ayato replied, his father nodded with a smile, seemingly satisfied. Yet, his expression would quickly darken, as if there was something he wanted to, but could not say.After much hesitation, and under his wife's melancholic gaze, his father would finally speak, his voice heavy:"Ayato... Remember, no matter what happens to the Kamisato Clan in the future, you are our eldest son, Ayaka's elder brother... A successor the Kamisato Clan is proud to have."After reminding his father to rest well, Ayato would take leave of his parents and return to his bedroom.The moment he opened the door, he saw the shining Vision lying on his desk.Ayato had heard since he was young that Visions are signs of the gods' favor, born of human wishes.Since his youth, he had longed to become the family's pillar, not for any great work, but to ensure that the clan would prosper, and to protect them.That this Vision should appear now... meant that, perhaps, the time had come for him to take up this burden.So thinking, Ayato did not call for the servants to light the lamps. Instead, he merely sat down beside the table.Many things flowed through his mind then like a tide:His father was gravely ill, and his mother was also unwell. The clan was leaderless, and its competitors eyed its position and power hungrily, as they had for some time now.His sister was still young, and he had to ensure that she grew up safely. The Shogunate courts were like a sea full of hidden reefs. One had to tread most carefully there...They could not let go of the Shuumatsuban, command over which had passed down through the family for generations. As for the servants, some few might still be trusted should the Kamisato Clan's strength wane...And as for Thoma, who had come from a different land, though he was a friend and useful ally both, would he consider other options should the Kamisato Clan truly fall?These scattered thoughts would gradually straighten themselves out in Ayato's mind, and at their center was his still-unchanged conviction-He would use any means at his disposal to secure the safety of his family and its future. Obstacles to that goal would be cleared away, no matter the cost.That night, the Vision was the only light that accompanied him.And when the first light of the next dawn alighted upon the desk, the young heir was already prepared to face the world.

<title>Delusion</title>
<text>the object the Archon Quest in Chapter II: Act III Delusion (Quest)
Delusions are powerful, Vision-like objects produced by the Fatui. Their production method and the number in circulation is unknown, but it appears to utilize the remains of deceased gods and other powerful beings. Like Visions, Delusions grant their wielders the ability to manipulate certain elements, but are supposedly far more powerful than Visions in exchange for draining the user's vitality or backfiring on them.Those Who Yearn for the Gods' Gaze
Knowledge about Delusions is scarce and it is a closely-guarded secret even among the Fatui. According to the Fatui member Viktor, few members beyond the Eleven Fatui Harbingers possess one, and they are personally granted by the Tsaritsa herself.Tales of Winter In recent years, Fatui agents have secretly been distributing mass-produced Delusions amongst commoners of the seven nations.
Overview
Based on current knowledge, Delusions utilize the remains of ancient gods and other powerful entities; the Delusions produced at Yashiori Island's Delusion Factory used Crystal Marrow, which contains the Tatarigami curse originating from the slain god Orobashi.Delusion (Quest) The Delusion used by Crepus and Diluc in the Manga was created alongside Barnabas' experiments on directly injecting archon residue - the remains of ancient godsDue to translation adjustments made since the manga's release, the term "archon residue" is an inaccurate translation of the original Chinese term, 魔神残渣 tl=demon god residue. 魔神 tl=demon god refers specifically to gods before the rise of The Seven. - into human subjects like Collei.Observing the way Jean holds the burnt papers in Chapter 6 (Part 2), pages 2–3 reveals that it is a single, folded document which details both Crepus' Delusion and the syringe used to inject Collei with archon residue, which is seen in a flashback in Chapter 10 (Part 1), page 18. The Knights could not have written the document since the syringe's side was written in an ancient language which none of them could read, which makes it a Fatui document by process of elimination.
A Delusion's abilities seem to depend on the type used. Ones used by the Fatui largely contain elemental powers and allow their users some degree of elemental manipulation abilities. The archon residue imbued in Collei and in Crepus and Diluc's Delusion is considered as having a "neutral" element despite manifesting as black fire, as their effects do not resemble that of any known element. During the investigation into the Black Fire incident she caused, Collei's fire was described as having a "great hunger for anything living," and people who touched it were "devoured" and all that was left of them were "charred remains."
The Knights of Favonius conducted some research on Delusions following the incident resulting in Crepus' death, although their documents on them were partially destroyed by fire. The little information Jean, Lisa, and Amber could salvage from the tattered documents revealed that Delusions emit the smell of Mist Grass upon use.
Side Effects
Delusions are extremely powerful, but potentially equally dangerous for their user: Crepus was either killed by using one, or left in such agony that Diluc chose to take his life to spare him the suffering. Some members of the Watatsumi Army who used Delusions suffered from rapid aging as a result of their vitality being drained, with some like Teppei dying from its effects.
The side effects of Delusion usage seem to vary from person-to-person. Crepus and Teppei died relatively shortly after taking up the Delusion, while Diluc used Crepus' Delusion for three years without any obvious consequences. The Delusion-users among the Resistance were unequally affected, but there is too little information to draw any conclusion on why that was so.
Too little is known about Fatui personnel to tell whether they suffer from the same Delusion side effects as non-Fatui users. Neither Childe nor Signora have displayed any physical drawbacks from using their Delusions, although neither are ordinary humans and so there are many potential reasons as to why. Childe has only been seen suffering the repercussions of using his Delusion in conjunction with the Abyss technique Foul Legacy Transformation. Signora's Delusion is explicitly different from most other Delusions, as she had previously transformed her body with the art of living flame and her Cryo Delusion - created with the Tsaritsa's "grace" - prevents it from consuming and killing her.Stainless BloomNarukami Island: Tenshukaku
It has been suggested that Signora's Delusion warped her already-unstable mind. Signora's memories of her past were suppressed upon gaining her Delusion,Hellfire Butterfly and the "delusion" Pierro gave her when he did so convinced her to join the Fatui.Molten Moment
Types of Delusions
Crepus' Delusion
In the manga, the Delusion in Crepus' possession takes the form of a red orb fitted onto a left-handed glove with a ring on the middle finger. The symbol inside the orb is not an elemental symbol or the Fatui emblem, but is instead a large circle with another smaller circle towards the bottom. When activated, it forms barbed chains that sprout from the palm of the glove, allowing them to grapple even large and powerful creatures like Ursa the Drake. These chains can also be conjured from magic circles, allowing more chains to be produced at once.
These chains can optionally be surrounded by black fire, as seen when Crepus used it to fight Ursa the Drake. When Diluc uses it to apprehend Krupp, the black fire is not present, but it reappears when he fights the Fatui personnel while posing as the perpetrator of the Black Fire incident.
Mass-Produced Delusions
The mass-produced Delusion confiscated by Gorou is a round glass orb with the Fatui insignia inlaid in it, encased in a jagged-edge frame. When Gorou displays it, the orb appears black while the Fatui emblem takes on a light gray color. Because no member of the Watatsumi Army is seen using a Delusion's power on-screen, it is currently impossible to discern how their Delusions' abilities manifested. Teppei, who used a mass-produced Delusion and never received a Vision, guessed that using a Vision would be similar.
The Delusions used by Agents, Cicin Mages, and Mirror Maidens is visually identical to those distributed to the Watatsumi Army, although their orbs are colored based on the elemental abilities they bestow. Childe's Vision, and by extension his Electro Delusion, uses the same casing as mass-produced Delusions, although the true form of his Delusion has been obfuscated (see below).
Childe's Delusion
Childe's Delusion appears to change forms, making it difficult to discern its true appearance. Pierro "pinned" it on him when he became a Harbinger, but Childe's regular character model has nothing that looks like his Electro Delusion. Instead, his Hydro Vision is held in the same casing used to encase mass-produced Delusions. When Childe enters the Delusion Unleashed phase of Enter the Golden House, the Hydro Vision on his belt appears to be supplanted by his Electro Delusion: The orb turns Electro purple and bears a Fatui symbol instead of the Hydro symbol. His clothing also changes color, although it is unclear whether that is directly related to his Delusion or not.
In his Foul Legacy phase, his Vision and Delusion change places again and he is capable of wielding both elements at the same time. The positions of his Vision and the badge along his right shoulder swap places; his Vision, bearing the Hydro symbol once again, can be seen on his shoulder, while the badge - which had no elemental color or symbol up until this point - moves down to his belt and bears the Fatui emblem with Electro purple colors.
Signora's Delusion
The appearance of Signora's Delusion is unconfirmed and she does not wear anything resembling an orb-type Delusion. Hers is also unique, in that her Delusion was bestowed to suppress her flame-based power rather than amplify it.
Based on her animations during the Narukami Island: Tenshukaku fight, the catalyst-like object that floats around her is probably her Delusion. At the start of battle, she uses it to activate the Cryo snowflake-like field under her feet, within which she could create icy blades while surrounded by a barrier. While preparing her transformation, she dispels the barrier and briefly remanifests the catalyst above her head before immediately using it to encase herself in an ice cocoon. After completing her transformation into her Crimson Witch of Embers phase, the catalyst cannot be seen on her, but it returns after she is defeated and she returns to her normal appearance.Duel Before the Throne

Story
Manga
Three years before the events of the manga, Crepus, Diluc's father, obtained a Delusion. While the exact circumstances behind how he obtained it is unclear, it seems to have been part of an overarching plot by Il Dottore's subordinates, which may include Krupp and Barnabas. Crepus planned on gifting to Diluc on his eighteenth birthday, but with Diluc's preternatural skills, Crepus deemed it unnecessary. When the Fatui lured Ursa the Drake to attack them on their way back to the Dawn Winery, Crepus wielded it to save Diluc, but its power backfired and left him in incredible agony. In the manga, Crepus disintegrates and disappears; however, Kaeya's Kaeya Lore Vision character story says Diluc put Crepus out of his misery by killing him. It is unknown which rendition is the truth.
Diluc ended up taking the Delusion for himself, and departed from Mondstadt to search for the Delusion's origins. He eventually traced it back to the Fatui and likely used the Delusion to fight them during his three-year journey across Teyvat. For reasons not fully known, the Delusion never backfired on Diluc, but it may be because Diluc was a Vision bearer while Crepus was not. Kaeya also learned about the Delusion, although he wouldn't be made aware of its origins until investigating the Black Fire Incident.
Upon Diluc's return to Mondstadt, he used it to ambush Krupp during the party at the Dawn Winery. Dottore silenced Krupp using an unknown weapon but decided not to make the incident public after taking an interest in Diluc's Delusion, which he calls a "Vision." He was likely unaware of the Delusion's nature, given his general apathy towards his subordinates' actions until they provide results that pique his interest.
Following the Black Fire Incident and the discovery of the link between the Delusion and Collei's archon residue powers, Diluc and Kaeya concocted a plan to derail the Fatui's plans. Taking advantage of the shared origins between the Delusion and Collei's black fire, Diluc posed as the perpetrator of the incident to lure the Fatui guards away from Collei, the actual perpetrator.
While Barnabas was not fooled and quickly caught up with Amber and Collei, Diluc arrived late into the fight and pinned him down with the Delusion's powers as Amber delivered the incapacitating blow. Before losing consciousness, Barnabas expressed his surprise upon seeing that Diluc was wielding the Delusion. Kaeya and the Fatui guards arrived on the scene and "captured" Diluc to bring him back to Dottore. However, Diluc escaped and sent Dottore the broken delusion, much to the Harbinger's consternation.
In-Game
When Signora attacks Venti and the Traveler, she creates a blizzard capable of instantly freezing Venti's legs. This is later shown to originate from a Cryo Delusion, given to her to suppress her Pyro abilities as the Rosalyne-Kruzchka Lohefalter Crimson Witch of Flames. She would continue using it during the Duel Before the Throne.
During the Heart of Glaze Golden House battle, Childe uses his Delusion. His Delusion's element is Electro, indicating that Delusions are not bound to its user's Vision element, if they have one.
While investigating claims of accelerated aging among the soldiers of the resistance, Gorou manages to seize the "secret weapon" they were using and shows it to the Traveler, who immediately recognizes it as a Delusion. Due to the Sakoku Decree, the Fatui had been making the Delusions in Inazuma by utilizing Crystal Marrow, supplied by the Kanjou Commission. The factory is later raided and razed by the resistance.

<title>The Yougou Three</title>
<text>The Yougou Three is a name Inazumans use to refer to three historical figures who trained under the Yougou Tengu five hundred years ago: Asase Hibiki, Kamuna Harunosuke, and Mikoshi Nagamasa. Following the various personal tragedies they suffered during the cataclysm, the three parted ways.The Narukami Trail
Story
The motivations Harunosuke and Nagamasa had for seeking the Yougou Tengu's teachings are unknown, although it is known that Hibiki wished to further her training as a shrine maiden. During their training, three dwelt in Araumi for a time and later discovered the Empty Boat of a Thousand Gates,Empty Boat of a Thousand Gates which was originally the Great Tengu Reizenbou's mansion.Interactable: Earth Kitsune Statue (in Araumi)'Someone's Voice: "To think that Master had a mansion here. I suppose we should have expected nothing less of the Yougou Tengu."'
'Someone's Voice: "Hmph, of course- Blergh! This place reeks of fox! Bleh!"'
'Someone's Voice: "Haha, it seems that the Lady Saiguu passed this way as well."' The three also became acquainted with Takamine the Mistsplitter, who also learned the Tengu arts during his period of servitude to the Great Tengu.Thundering Pulse However, he does not seem to be considered part of the group.
When the cataclysm struck and monsters from the Abyss ravaged Teyvat, four figures who had a great influence on The Yougou Three went off to battle alongside the Raiden Shogun: Takamine, Reizenbou, the Kitsune Saiguu, and Chiyo, Nagamasa's mother. Of them, only Reizenbou returned intact; the Kitsune Saiguu perished, Takamine disappeared, and Chiyo was corrupted and went mad. Reizenbou, enraged by her own inability to protect the Kitsune Saiguu despite being her bodyguard, withdrew from the world.
Deeply grieved by this turn of events, The Yougou Three split ways. Harunosuke left for Liyue to pursue the path of the adepti, Hibiki returned to Asase Shrine on Seirai Island, and Nagamasa joined the Shogunate to restore the Mikoshi Clan's reputation.</text>

<title>Jinni</title>
<text>The Jinn (singular: Jinni) are a mystical race of elemental spirits that were created by Nabu Malikata.  After the goddess's death, they turned to serve King Deshret. Besides bottles, Jinn are also stated to indwell items such as weapons.Xiphos' Moonlight
Overview
I'm a creation of the sky, yet also a creature of this world. I'm an exile of the ages, a faithful servant to my great lord. I'm an elemental spirit who will not bow to flesh and blood, an eternal prisoner content with the illusion of comfort...
Jinn are elemental spirits and have translucent bodies; while the female jinn described in legends are implied to have human-like features, the jinni in Dori's lamp has a distinctly non-human appearance and instead appears as a spherical creature with a grinning face.
Jinn are believed to be capable of possessing a human's body, which one Jinni uses as a threat against the human boy she dubs "Raven."The Shepherd and the Magic Bottle Normally, however, they reside in items such as magic lamps or weapons.
History
The Jinn were born after Nabu Malikata was cast aside by the heavens, said to be birthed from "intoxicating dreams and the bitter memories of loss." Nabu Malikata wandered the barren wastes for seventy-two nights, her heels worn through by the gravel. The blood that gushed from those wounds turned into springs and streams, which subsequently flowed into gardens. The Jinn were born from the water lilies that grew in those gardens. The Jinn begged her to stay with them, and she agreed.Artifact, Flower of Paradise Lost: Ay-Khanoum's Myriad
Eventually, Nabu Malikata met King Deshret, and together they built the city of Ay-Khanoum, a name which means "City of the Moon Maiden" in the Jinn's ancient language.Oasis Garden's Mourning In stories that do not include the Goddess of Flowers, it is instead believed that King Deshret learned about the Jinn's story after capturing them and, afterwards, built Ay-Khanoum as a gift to the Jinn; in return, they built the entrance to the Mausoleum of King Deshret.
The Jinn allegedly became willing servants of King Deshret in his endeavor to rule over the world, entering the silver magic bottles he created for them and becoming marked by his seal. Afterwards, they engaged in acts of creation and exploration on his behalf. According to Liloupar, King Deshret had deceived the Jinn to gain their servitude, telling them that the Goddess of Flowers had not perished but was instead locked in a deep slumber in The Orchard of Pairidaeza, and that he could awaken her with the Jinn's aid.</text>

<title>Apep's Creatures</title>
<text>Apep's Creatures '(unofficial name)' are elemental creatures generated from the abundant elemental energy inside Apep, the Dendro Dragon. The dragon is their creator, and also their home. They are encountered in Homecoming.
Overview
The Traveler's analogy describes Apep's creatures as small Dendro Slimes generated from Large Dendro Slime (Apep). Inside Apep was an entire world, which its creatures considered the greatest place ever. Apep once promised that the creatures could start life in a new world once they were mature enough. However, that day never came. The apocalypse, also known as Forbidden Knowledge, accumulated by Apep's desperation, and later by consuming Amun's body, corrupted Apep and its creatures. Many of Apep's creatures could not make it out of the dragon's body, so they suffered the greatest. The gruesome adaptation to the apocalypse turned them into Proliferating Organisms. Some creatures were luckier and were able to escape, and they desperately tried to find a way to cure Apep and go home.
When outside of Apep's body, all of the creatures adapted into the form of Fungus Fungi due to their suitable adaptation to Sumeru's land. Even when they escaped the dragon, all creatures were still infected with the apocalypse, and later became one with the apocalypse itself. When they had suffered enough and reached the end of their life, they became the tumor of the decay phenomenon known as The Withering.
The escaped creatures eventually came to Greater Lord Rukkhadevata and requested her aid. However, Rukkhadevata was weakened after the suppression of the forbidden knowledge caused by King Deshret. Despite this, she still agreed to help the creatures and Apep, and they together made a special device known as the Fire Seed to reactivate the Heart of Oasis inside Apep's body. However, since she was weakened, the Fire Seed was unstable. She also blessed a certain creature with life forces so it could survive in The Chasm, so it could "transform" the Forbidden Knowledge into something else due to the power of a Divine Nail residing there. She predicted that if the Forbidden Knowledge were eradicated, Apep's creatures, which had "become" the apocalypse, would also lose a part of themselves. So if the creature can change the Forbidden Knowledge into something else, they can still remember it.
It is unknown if the second spread of the forbidden knowledge in the cataclysm affected Apep's creatures and caused them more suffering than they already were.
In the present day, after Lesser Lord Kusanali removes the presence of Rukkhadevata and the forbidden knowledge in the Irminsul, both she and the creatures have their views greatly altered. Nahida does not know about the promise and wonders about the Fire Seed found in her Sanctuary of Surasthana, while the creatures lose many memories and life forces due to the void left by the removal. They eventually remember it due to the special creature in the Chasm, and they set out to save Apep. However, the Fire Seed has been broken, and the creatures sacrifice their growth and themselves to reactivate Apep's Heart of Oasis. The guardians and the proliferating organisms also got turned into elemental power. Apep assures that the creatures will be reborn when the dragon's condition has been stable, but their knowledge, memories, and emotions have been permanently lost.
Powers and Abilities
Apep's creatures are Dendro elemental life forms that originated from the Dendro Dragon Apep, so they inherited their progenitor's great power of adaptation. As shown by their Fungi transformation, they were a perfect mimicry. They were able to blend in the population, communicate with fellow Fungi, and even "have" a child Fungus, although it is unspecified about the reproduction of Fungi. Even when suffering from the apocalypse, they could still exist as Proliferating Organisms thanks to the most gruesome adaptation.
As they have become one with the apocalypse, they were able to spread the disaster against their will. The Withering, and arguably Eleazar, were the result influenced by forbidden knowledge.</text>

<title>Snapshotting</title>
<text>The term snapshotting refers to the state in which attributes are fixed on a long-lasting ability, effect, entity, or summon based on the character's attributes during the ability's activation. A snapshotted ability will not receive the additional buffs the character obtains after its activation.
For example, Xiangling's Pyronado will receive the Attack ATK Bonus for the entirety of its duration when cast inside Bennett's Fantastic Voyage field - even if Xiangling walks outside the buff's area of effect or it expires prematurely. However, the ATK Bonus will not affect Pyronado if cast before Bennett's Fantastic Voyage - regardless of whether Xiangling stays in the buff's area of effect.
Non-Snapshottable Buffs
While most buffs function by modifying the target character's stats and can be snapshotted by the correct abilities, there are certain exceptions.
Such buffs do not modify the damage dealer's attributes, and instead directly apply to real-time damage calculations. Therefore, these buffs are 'unable to be snapshotted'.
Note that as a general rule, if a buff results in a visible change in the target character's stat menu (e.g. ATK buffs, Elemental DMG Bonus buffs), it is snapshottable. If a buff does 'not' result in a visible change in stats (e.g. Elemental Burst DMG Bonus buffs, Additive Base DMG Bonus buffs), it is non-snapshottable. Exceptions are All DMG buffs provided by Serpent Spine, Iron Sting, Primordial Jade Winged-Spear, The Alley Flash, and Song of Stillness, which are snapshottable despite not appearing in the menu.
The following tables are an exhaustive list of non-snapshottable buffs provided by character abilities and equipments. Any buffs not listed here are snapshottable.
Talents and Constellations
Elemental Reaction !! Uses Snapshotted EM
MeltVaporize || yes
OverloadedShatteredElectro-ChargedSuperconductSwirlBurningBloomHyperbloomBurgeonAggravateSpread || no
For example, the Superconduct damage triggered by Ganyu's Celestial Shower will be boosted by Sucrose's Catalyst Conversion even after Ganyu's talent is cast. Prior to the version changes, the Superconduct damage would only be boosted if Sucrose's talent was triggered before Ganyu's burst.

<title>Gaming/Lore</title>
<text>Personality
Guard of the Sword and Strongbox Secure Transport Agency, and the head of the "Mighty Mythical Beasts" Wushou troupe.
Gaming is a young and energetic man working for the Sword and Strongbox Secure Transport Agency. He has a very strong work ethic, eagerly completing whatever his clients may ask of him and will fiercely protect their cargo regardless of the situation. He also enjoys Wushou Dances, something which he practices regularly on a daily basis, wanting to become a professional dancer. This practice has made him nimble and proficient in martial arts, despite the numerous injuries he obtains doing so. As such, he is well-liked by the people of Yilong Wharf, who see him as reliable and optimistic.
In his youth, his energetic personality made him renowned as a troublemaker and oddball. He is fond of his mother, having picked up her manner of speaking (which includes gesticulations) and carries her letter in a book she gave him, though he misses her dearly after her passing. After being shown a wushou dance by his Yip Tak father, Gaming became inspired to become one himself, causing him to be at odds with his father, who wanted him to continue the family business. This nearly resulted in a fistfight, though he ended up leaving home to fend for himself. His father had only opposed the idea because he felt that the family could provide for him, but after witnessing his show firsthand and a talk with Zhongli, reconciled with him and agreed to let him pursue his own path.
Outside of work, if not practicing Wushou Dances, Gaming enjoys drinking tea and eating small bites. He does not mind eating any food, as long as they taste natural.
Appearance
'(To be added.)'
Official Introduction
Gaming: Stalwart Strider
He sees and hears everything, as if he  had the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox, like some kind of mythical  beast. Fighting tooth and nail, he drove away bandits and ruffians like  devils with all the auspicious momentum of the suanni.
If you happen to hear the sound of drums and  gongs as you're walking through the streets of Liyue Harbor, let your ears lead the way. With a bit of luck, you might just be fortunate enough to  witness a performance of Gaming's remarkable Wushou Dance.
When he puts on his mask, he shakes his head and blinks like a waking  beast. The vast array of emotions he conjures up, the unpredictable twists and turns... Following his every move with rapture, the audience can't help but cheer and applaud.
"Thank you for your support, everyone! And remember, if someone you know's thinking of booking a Wushou Dance, don't forget to recommend the 'Mighty Mythical Beasts'!"
It's just a shame that, more often than not, he receives nothing but applause in return. But Gaming doesn't let this get to him — he laughs it off, saying that the audience's attention is all the recognition he needs.
Once the crowd has dispersed and his mask is off, Gaming swiftly returns to being a "guard" and thinking of work matters once more: How many cargo shipments still need delivering? Which clients does he need to escort? And so on...
Usually, when there's nothing urgent on, he heads to Xinyue Kiosk to while away the time with some dim sum — a pot of tea, a selection of bite-sized nibbles, and leisurely chatter in the company of good friends.
As a guard, the task of escorting goods from Yilong Wharf to Liyue Harbor couldn't be easier for Gaming. But as the head of the "Mighty Mythical Beasts," his dream of making the Wushou Dance a regular occurrence in Liyue Harbor still has a long, long road ahead of it...
So in the meantime, why not sit and enjoy another cup of tea?
Character Stories
Goods flow through Yilong Wharf round the clock, and the merchant convoys and their cargo have need of guards to escort them through the various regions of Liyue to other lands.Since ancient times, such escort work has been no easy task. Even in an era of relative safety on the roads such as this, any one escort run could involve any number of variables.Perhaps this employer might change the route on an ad hoc basis, or perhaps that customer will nitpick and refuse to accept the goods, never mind how the roads do not lack for all manner of petty crooks if one is fortunate, and big-time bandits if one is not.Although the Sword and Strongbox Secure Transport Agency has no shortage of capable, skilled staff, were you to comb through all their roster, the only one among their ranks who can keep clients happy while beating any brigands down is Gaming.The merchant guilds, for their part, are quite eager to have this young, competent guard to escort their cargo, and Gaming is no less popular on the streets outside of work than he is in his professional capacity. Indeed, any and all friends of this busy fellow will rate him two thumbs up."It was a piece of cake! Come see our Wushou Dance when you're free! Don't worry, just enjoy the show, and we'll call it even. Thanks in advance, haha!"Whenever someone on the receiving end of his help wants to return the favor, this will be his jocular reply.
Gaming was born in Qiaoying Village, a place famous for its tea, and his ancestors had been tea farmers for several generations, only switching to mainly selling tea leaves during his father Yip Tak's time. With his parents working together, their business was getting better by the day, and of course, any father would hope for his son to succeed him in the family business.Thanks to his father's hard work, at least Gaming no longer had to experience the backbreaking daily grind of farm work, nor would he have to start a business from scratch. But as they say, "like father, like son" - Gaming turned out to have his own ideas about which road to tread, just as his father had chosen to diverge from Gaming's grandfather's decision to keep growing tea.The two were at an impasse, with neither accepting the other's view. Only Gaming's eventual departure from their home put a stop to the arguments between father and son.For his next haunt, Gaming chose the bustling Yilong Wharf, having planned out how he'd make his living a while back - through a passion of his that had burned since childhood, Wushou Dance, of course.Filled with enthusiasm and confidence that created complacency, the young man blazed through creating all the relevant props, even printing flyers introducing himself and booking performance venues... He planned to plant his feet first in Yilong Wharf, then conquer Liyue Harbor, and finally, to introduce Wushou Dance to Teyvat at large...Suffice it to say that the diligent youth's passionate pursuit of his dream sent all of the business startup funds he had saved up before leaving home up in smoke, leaving him quite broke in short order."Making Wushou Dance your career? As if! Forget making a living, hah, you'd be lucky not to starve!"Hungry as he was, Gaming now understood his father's words.With the mindset "What's done is done, let's focus on getting a meal first," Gaming had little choice but to find a job that could put food on his table.Fortunately, fate has a habit of giving right after taking. Lantern Rite was just around the corner at the time, and the good-hearted young man led a Fontainian merchant to the Sword and Strongbox Secure Transport Agency just as a lead guard was fretting over a manpower shortage. Gaming took the opportunity to recommend himself and was promptly taken on as a temp employee.Thanks to his daily Wushou Dance training, he had a strong foundation in martial arts and tenacity in the face of hardship, and was promptly asked to stay on as an official guard for hire after finishing that escort run.All in all, that definitely counted as feeding himself through Wushou Dance... right? That was how Gaming saw it, anyway.
Language is one of the most important tools for communication between people, and Gaming's distinctive way of using this "tool" is especially interesting."Well, my friend, I do hope you stay in warm waters and on the wall.""Why, you ask? Well, warm's just the way we like it, and your wall's a good fit, isn't it?"And whenever the other party gets confused, Gaming will try supplementing his explanation through different methods, complete with various gesticulations to demonstrate his point.This manner of speaking, he explains, he got from his mother, who married into Qiaoying Village from afar, and to whom he was quite attached after his birth. He would follow her just about everywhere, and in his doings and interactions with others, he would pick up many of her habits and interests.Nothing to do? Get some dim sum. Feeling hot and woozy? Brew up some cooling tea. Eating a meal? Got to have some greens... and no, melons and fruits are not greens.These habits are not ironclad, of course. If a friend came up with some new suggestion, he would be game to try it out. People from all lands were brethren, after all, and it is Gaming's way to treat all with sincerity.He can easily shoot the breeze with just about anyone in Yilong Wharf, young or old. At first, most think his polite speech to just be pretty pleasantries, but after some time, they will find that he is being perfectly earnest. He will introduce the itinerant handyman Duqin to work opportunities, assist the ever-busy Zhigui, fetch medicinal wines from Liyue Harbor for his fellow guards, and even get Dip Yeuk to give a Suanni-themed toy to a child whom he himself has never met, all because Dip once mentioned that the boy liked watching Wushou Dance...Priceless is the friend who knows your heart, and so everyone returns the favor to this big-hearted lad. They always invite him to come in and rest his feet when he comes by with a delivery, and there is always a seat for him at a dim sum table - well, on the condition that he doesn't say "I'll foot the bill."Gaming often claims that he'd never have gotten far in Yilong Wharf without everyone's help, but those familiar with the humble, earnest lad know that he would have been fine no matter where he was.
Practice makes the professional. As such, no matter how busy work gets at the transport agency, Gaming will take time to train.At meals, Gaming may be found tussling cheekily with his colleagues over dishes, wielding his chopsticks like a seasoned duelist, while under the table his knees are bent in a low horse stance, sturdy as a mountain. After the cargo is packed, he will rarely get a cart to move it to a warehouse but instead will lift it all himself, box by box, to train his arm strength.The lead guard knew that their work was hard and laborious, and so from time to time would call for suggestions on items that might be added to the office for relaxation purposes.Soft beds, comfortable pillows, Genius Invokation TCG decks...At that moment, Gaming cleared his throat and said: "If possible, could we have some Plum Blossom Poles installed in the front yard so we can train better? Bet if we firm up our fundamentals, it'll make our work a whole lot easier!"His words were met with silence. Everyone was just discussing where to go after work, and here was someone saying that overtime was the best break. Why, this was a crime most heinous, and "punishment" was in order! So they gathered about him like bees in a hive, some "screeching," others "pleading," still others pretending to "advise" him, laughing and cavorting."Have mercy on me and accept my apologies, brothers, and thank you for giving me my minute of glory. How about this, then? How about I treat you all to some dim sum? Will that make amends?"This sort of horsing about happened every so often among the guards, of course. Everyone knew that Gaming wanted the Plum Blossom Pillars for Wushou Dance practice, and everyone was just playing along with him, wagging their tongues and fingers and feigning their reactions so his birthday surprise wouldn't be spoiled. In truth, they had already stacked those pillars up outside - all that remained was for them to put them up together.During their downtime, Gaming also often invites his fellow guards to take up Wushou Dance, and everyone has indeed tried it at least once on account of it "looking totally dope," though almost none have persevered for long, with one of them even joking that:"If we put suffering on a podium, we guards would get bronze, Wushou Dance masters silver, and Gaming would get gold, since he does both!"Not wrong, in truth.
"Our kid from another family." This is the highest of the glowing evaluations Gaming has received from the streets of Yilong Wharf. And little wonder. He's a mature and decent sort, and having left his home, he has earned his status and reputation without relying on anyone else.Only those aunts and uncles who saw him grow up know that he was once the notorious "demon king" of Qiaoying Village.If he wasn't climbing up the roof tiles, he was grabbing at the bird nests in trees, and he would go into the fields with the adults to harvest tea, to the point where his father paying damages to the neighbors for those incidents was practically routine.In truth, however, he climbed up the house beams to help his father store a private stash of Mora, and he rummaged through bird nests to help his mother collect feathers for head ornaments, and he was thrashing in the fields trying to capture pests and harmful bugs...As an oddball, Gaming's head is always full of strange, bright new ideas, leaving others quite dumbfounded, and so his parents only ever spoiled him more despite his mischievousness.Having heard that a somewhat famous Wushou Dance troupe from Yilong Wharf would be performing in Qiaoying Village, his father had handed work over to his assistants long beforehand, preparing to get Gaming one of the best seats to the watch the spectacular show.But on the day of the dance itself, he tarried too long at the tea table as he dined on dim sum with his friends, and by the time Gaming had pulled both parents before the stage, it had already been ringed by spectators thrice and thrice again. There would be no watching the Wushou Dance today, it seemed."Daddy's a cheat and a fibber! You said we'd go see the big Suanni!"There was no comforting him by this point. Even attempts to placate him with promises of purchasing toys were drowned out by his cries."Little kids who don't listen to their parents will get eaten by the Suanni! Check out how fierce it is!"So saying, Gaming's father lifted the boy atop his shoulders. At that moment, the Suanni onstage leapt onto a tall pillar, and it turned and looked, locking eyes with Gaming.All at once the boy stopped crying, staring with wide eyes and open mouth at the dance taking place onstage. After the show had ended and the crowd dispersed, Gaming continued to gaze back in the direction of the stage the whole way home. Only then did his parents see that something was amiss. Could he have been frightened so by the words spoken previously?"Ah, Gaming, no need to be scared. That wasn't a real Suanni! There were people inside, and they don't eat children...""Daddy! I wanna watch the show again! I wanna be like that big Suanni. Raaaarr!"From that day forth, Gaming, once whimsical (some might say half-hearted) in all his fancies, became utterly consumed with Wushou Dance, often badgering his father to take him to see shows, and his indiscriminate mischief-making gradually turned to (what he thought was) meticulous and well-planned Wushou Dance training.At least eight bamboo baskets became casualties of his road to mastery in lifting the beast's head, cruelly felled by kicks.As for the various rice and soup spoons that went missing around the house, they were no doubt taken to be used for drum practice, dragging not a few basins and benches down with them.Once, Gaming went with his father to purchase a batch of new tea from the farmers, when a bamboo basket was passed to him, he performed a "Suanni's Salutation" on reflex, raising the basket and beginning to dance. The tea leaves were scattered everywhere, and Gaming wound up being chased around the village with his father in hot pursuit. And when the father finally returned, pulling his son by the ear, their meal had already gone cold, and the mistress of the house had long been waiting expectantly at the door for their return, rattan rod in hand...In spring, autumn, winter, and summer, his parents would sit at home, his father nursing some tea and his mother snacking on melon seeds, and watch their son jump up and down, beast-head in hand...It is a pity that such days, so ordinary they could not be more ordinary, can now only return in dreams.
Children really do change as they grow up, and that little child engrossed in watching Wushou Dance grew to become a spirited youth. The one thing that did not change was his passion for Wushou Dance, and still he dreamed of making it big in Liyue Harbor one day. But compared to Yilong Wharf, things were different there. In Liyue Harbor, Wushou Dance was seen as a new-ish folk practice that originated in Chenyu Vale - it was appreciated, sure, but it was no money-maker, and certainly not ingrained in people's hearts in the same way Liyue opera was.The more Gaming's father watched his son bustle about tirelessly, the more he worried about the youth's future, and not a few times did he speak seriously with the boy about the difficulties of starting a business. And each time, Gaming would retort that staying in business was harder yet, and declined to succeed his father in the tea leaf business. In earlier years, when his mother was still around, any impasse between the two could be broken up around the dinner table, but after she passed from illness, it was as if the glue from this father-son relationship had come unstuck, and they grew distant.Gaming's father blamed her falling ill on the immense amount of labor she had put into starting the business with him, and by extension, himself. If something were to happen to their only son, how could he ever face her? And thus, when Gaming was once again injured when practicing Wushou Dance, he could take no more, and gave all of his son's equipment away, leaving only the beast head his wife had made. To his shock, Gaming left without a word the very next day, taking said head with him.In truth, his son's departure did not only leave him angry, but also stewing in a melange of emotions and wavering reflection. He had in fact been constantly asking those close to him at the Communications Office to help take care of his son over the years, but whenever Gaming came up in conversation, his words could be brutal and blunt - nor would he put aside his pride to proactively mend relations.Leong, an assistant to the business, would write to Gaming come every festival, discussing some awkward matters that were neither here nor there - and of course, even a witless twit could guess that he was doing so at the behest of Gaming's father. Even so, Gaming was not as headstrong and free-spirited as he often appeared, and he never exposed Leong, instead going along with the letters, even asking after matters at home, intentionally or otherwise...To Gaming, reading Leong's letters was akin to defusing a bomb, and in truth, he sometimes hoped to receive nothing at all. Just as he once feared that the villagers might come and say "Your father's on his way to give you a good whooping," he now feared that someone might say "Your father was at home when he had a fall"... Whether then or now, no news was good news.Thus did father and son continue to be stubborn, each seemingly convinced that the other would understand them in time... Gladsome was it, then, that ever-ardent Ms. Xianyun would intercede before such reticence could turn to regret. With the bridge she built, and with the aid of able allies, Gaming's father was finally able to center himself and find calm, finishing watching his son's masterful, exciting Wushou Dance performance. From awkwardness to active dialog they went, and at last, they were again able to open up to each other, with Gaming's father accepting his son's career choice."Well, remember to come watch next time I perform in Liyue Harbor.""I don't need you to tell me that.""In that case, don't chat too long over dim sum, or you might not be able to squeeze your way in when you come late...""You rascal!"
Gaming doesn't like reading, but he has kept a book under his pillow for years. Tucked inside its pages is the only letter his mother ever wrote to him."...The thing I'm most worried about after I'm gone is that you and your father will get into arguments every day. All this agitation is simply no good for anyone. Don't blame your dad, he's more bark than bite. He's just concerned that you'll have a tough time on your own in the future and doesn't want you to go through such hardships. Do you remember that time when you sprained your leg? Your father was so anxious that he ran frantically to the physician, with you on his back. He was worried sick, and he secretly cried under the blankets that night. You are a big boy now, do show some consideration for your dad and let him have his way sometimes. Don't quarrel with your dad if you can help it...""...Don't worry, I'm not against you learning Wushou Dance. In fact, I'm glad that you found something you like and enjoy doing while you were young. But you have to promise me to be careful and not force yourself so you don't get hurt! And please be careful not to eat anything too heaty, cold or raw, and don't be too picky about what you eat and drink... Remember to wear more layers when it's stormy and raining, don't neglect keeping yourself warm just because you want to look cool!""...As you step into society, you have to stay true to yourself. Don't let yourself or others down. The worst thing you can do is to make empty promises and be someone who is 'all talk, no action.'""There's no harm in knowing more people. If you find a friend who you can really connect with, you absolutely must treat them well with a sincere heart. It's not about the number of friends you have but the quality of your friendships. You should count yourself lucky if you find someone you can rely on. I know you won't want to talk to your dad about things that are bothering you, so just find a friend whom you can share your woes with. No matter what you do, don't bottle up your feelings, and definitely don't do anything silly, alright?""I'm feeling a little tired, so I'll take a rest now. I know I always say, 'You little rascal, I wish I'd given birth to a chunk of char siu instead of you,' and you always sulk when you hear it... But I want you to know that you're not a little rascal and that you're so, so much better than a piece of char siu... You will always be my little boy that I cherish and love most in the world..."Judging from the creases, the letter has been opened and put away again and again. Placing it between the pages of a book was indeed a clever way to preserve the letter.The book in which he kept the letter had been used by his mother as a coaster for her teacup, and now that it had passed down to Gaming, he too had found a new purpose for it."Mom actually told me I should read more. Please, has she ever opened the book herself? Oh, oops, pretend I didn't say anything! Otherwise, Mom will give me a good whacking in my dreams!"Gaming never cries when he talks about his mother in front of others. He knows she would have wanted him to be optimistic and happy and move on with his life. And that's exactly what he did.It's just that the wind always blows sand into his eyes when he's alone and when he's thinking about his mother, even when he's in his bedroom, where there's neither wind nor sand.
A certain question had always vexed Gaming - what does a Suanni look like, exactly? Having asked his seniors, he found out that they had never seen a real one either, and they had relied on their teachers to hand down the art of Wushou Dance to them. If he really wanted to find out, it was going to be an adventure unto itself.Random chance allowed him to borrow a few old texts about the solitary Suanni hidden in the mountains from Xingqiu. Several nights did he do battle against the unfamiliar words that rushed his position like a relentless army of ants, only to be defeated at last, remembering only a few key phrases like "fierce," "majestic," and "untamed."A giant beast of most heroic bearing indeed! He was sure that if only he could lay eyes upon it, he would gain much inspiration for his Wushou Dance performances. It was with this belief that Gaming would often poke about the locations the books mentioned. And when he came to Mt. Lingmeng, he sensed an oppressive aura about, as if a pair of eyes hidden in the bushes were watching him. This was it, Gaming intuited.Before dawn broke the next day, he made himself presentable, and brought his favorite beast head and a big bag of food offerings into the mountains. Suddenly, a strong gust blew by, and before he could react, a dark shadow had swooped about him, looping around him in circles. He immediately closed his eyes and clapped his hands together, stating his intent in a reverent and loud voice."O Great Suanni, Gaming greets you! I came here simply to witness your majesty... and I brought lots of good food for your enjoyment, too! Now, ah, if you don't mind, could I open my eyes?"Hearing no more movement, he slowly re-opened his eyes, only to witness a large... difference between how he had imagined a Suanni to look and this cute little creature that sat proudly upon a giant stone."Whoa, seriously!? You're so tiny! And cute! Who's a good Suanni? That's right, you are! C'mon, let me give you some headpats, and..."In his excitement, Gaming overstepped and displeased the Suanni, and though it was indeed very small, it had an extraordinary energy about it, and like a furious flame it jumped all around the young man until he grew dizzy, the items he had brought dropping from his hands. Almost unconsciously, Gaming grabbed at the beast head and began dueling the creature. What the Suanni would do, Gaming would imitate, and so they continued from daylight till dusk - to a bystander, they might even have seemed like playmates meeting again after a long separation. Finally, the Suanni seemed to acknowledge him, and as it shook its head about, a shiny stone popped out of its mane."Really? A Vision, too? Is this what they mean by 'good things come in pairs'?"Carefully did Gaming approach that stone, finding it to be an absolutely real, positively genuine chunk of ore that had only shone under the glare of the setting sun.Ah, a misunderstanding, then. It was a shame, of course, but it did not dampen his mood - indeed, it was from this moment that the "Mighty Mythical Beasts" troupe was formally founded.From that day onward, Gaming and Man Chai were inseparable, and he quickly forgot about that whole Vision affair...Some time later, Gaming was escorting a merchant caravan when he encountered a ruthless gang of bandits. The merchants advised him to retreat - lost cargo could be written off as a cost of business, but lost lives could not."Hah! I've never been able to stand those who steal and rob for a living. Even if I wasn't on the job, I'd give them a piece of my mind, and as it happens, making them regret their life choices is my job and I'm on the clock. You go first, boss, and I'll hold the line here. I guarantee not one crate will be lost, nor will a single hair on your heads be harmed!"Thus did Gaming go one against ten, and though he sustained numerous injuries, he persevered until all the brigands were bound, and both the Millelith and his colleagues had arrived, before allowing himself to slump over.The merchants would later inspect their goods, only to find that, indeed, not a single item was missing, and there was even something that had not been in the manifest - a Vision.They wrapped the item carefully before having it delivered, alongside the thank-you plaque they gave Gaming, to the Sword and Strongbox Agency.Gaming was caught completely off-guard by the gem, with only surprise and not gladness registering in his heart, which was instead overwhelmed with a series of questions."What, really? Is this mine? I mean, I was just escorting some goods, nothing special. I mean, don't I do that every day?""Should I return it? But to whom? The caravan? No, wait, they said it wasn't theirs... Could it have been... that no-good low-down crook's?""No, no, what am I thinking! Well, in that case... I guess this Vision really maybe probably might be mine, then?""But I've heard that they have to do with strong wishes. I didn't get it back when I was dancing in front of Man Chai, and now I just... randomly got it on the job. Does that mean... that I was always meant to be a guard, but I was led astray by Wushou Dance?""Is this a hint that I should give up on it? In that case, I'd rather not have this Vision at all!"This lasted until he got the wrapping cloth off the plaque-And then he saw it, shaped as it was: like a beast of good omen, ears and eyes on the alert, seeing and hearing all.The defeat of these crooks, he realized, was a deed that made him akin in spirit to the monster-subjugating Suanni.Only then did the doubt clouding over Gaming's heart clear, and in response, he cleaned his hands on his clothes before accepting this Vision with all due ceremony.</text>

<title>Khaenri'ah/Culture</title>
<text>The nation of Khaenri'ah is marked by being a "pride of humankind" which "never had a god to begin with".
Life in Khaenri'ah
Agriculture
Khaenri'ah is dark underground and mostly barren of natural life. This led Khaenri'ahns to focus on artificial creation of life itself by developing the Art of Khemia.
Architecture
According to Dainsleif, Inverted City the ruins in The Chasm: Underground Mines look somewhat similar to those of Khaenri'ah, and their civilization had ties to the one of Khaenri'ah.The Grave of the Guarded
The remnants of ancient Khaenri'ah like the Ruins of Dahri, giant Ruin Golems in Sumeru or an Viewpoint Forge of the Abandoned Foundry Azosite factory located in the Girdle of the Sands all share a grandiose scale. Furthermore, the Golems, the Azosite factory and the Madinat al-Nuhas testing facility share the same industrial, brass feel on the inside.
Education
Khaenri'ah possessed a Royal Library, to which nobles (no information about others) such as Chlothar had access. They were still forbidden from accessing the banned texts which the library held, among which were those that involved recipes that required the power and blessings from the Seven, as they were considered taboo.Fortune-Mocking Pedigree
Technology
Khaenri'ahn technology before the cataclysm was advanced enough to allow production of automatons known as Ruin Machines, which were considered weapons of war. These machines could remain active for hundreds of years, mostly due in part to a self-repair system. They took on the forms of various wildlife on the surface and could even imitate some of their functions.
Khaenri'ahns used Azosite as a form of energy, drawn from pure elemental energy from Ley Lines,Sumeru Azosite formed into Energy Blocks for use and produced in the factory located in the Girdle of the Sands.Rene's Investigation Notes This workshop was the last in the entire kingdom to use an Azosite-powered system.Interactable: Gavireh Lajavard Ragged Engineering Notes Ragged Engineering Notes
Khemia was also an advanced art, compared to widespread alchemy.
Designs, Motifs, and Symbols
Symbols in Teyvat
The following designs, motifs, and symbols are largely exclusive to the Khaenri'ah or Khaenri'ah-affiliated parties.
Four-Pointed Star
's talent, Homuncular Nature]]
The four-pointed star (unofficial name), is a recurring astroid star. It is a recurring symbol on Khaenri'ah-adjacent characters' clothing and design. Notably, pure-blooded Khaenri'ahns have pupils that take the shape of a four-pointed star. The shape can be found on Albedo's neck between his collarbones. This symbol is also prominently used in association with the Traveler.
Eight-Pointed Star
150x150px]]
This motif is a recurring symbol tied to Khaenri'ah, present on Chlothar's and Halfdan's clothes, The Black Serpents' armors and on Gate of Zulqarnain. The eight-pointed star shape also appears on or around the 'eyes' of Ruin Machines.
Fashion
Men's Fashion
Royal Guard Armors
This is the present state of armor of degraded husks of The Black Serpents.
Languages
With the influx of the immigrants, Khaenri'ah likely used the Teyvat Language common language. It is also likely that the nation used a version of now-associated with the Abyss Latin-Based Language.
Politics
Before the cataclysm, Khaenri'ah had been a monarchy with a stratified society, by class and likely by nationality (native Khaenri'ahns contrasted with the immigrants). Around the time of the cataclysm, the political power of the Eclipse Dynasty waned, allowing the noble Alberich Clan to usurp power with Anfortas as the regent.
Following the gods' invasion of Khaenri'ah, the current leadership is unknown, but people still continue to live in the nation and struggle against the curse inflicted by them. Kaeya was intentionally abandoned in Mondstadt near the Dawn Winery for the sake of an "ancient plot".</text>

<title>Childish Jiang</title>
<text>Childish Jiang zh=小姜 zh_rm=Xiǎojiāng is an NPC found in the Sea of Clouds region, northwest of Liyue Harbor, Liyue. He starts the World Quest 'A Little Game', where he plays a game of hide-and-seek with the player.
Profile
Jiang'er is the son of Shaoyuan and Duan'ya. While loved by his parents, Jiang appears to suffer from a mental illness that causes him to think and act like a child, which earned him the name Childish Jiang. His father served with the Millelith and inquired with Bubu Pharmacy to discern what was afflicting Jiang'er.
His father was eventually called upon to serve what he hoped was his final mission, but died in the process. He had expressed an intention to take him and his mother away to another place to live in should his resignation be declined. His mother, who learned of her husband's death, chose not to reveal what happened to Jiang'er, instead opting for a game of hide-and-seek. Jiang'er's mother soon left and died sometime later, not wishing to traumatize her son. When he heard extra voices on the mountain, he believed she had brought help and hid even more. Jiang'er never hid too far from the home and would occasionally return to eat, but he never saw his mother ever again.
Jiang'er would survive his childhood thanks to assistance from Uncle Tian (who calls himself a "distant" relative) and his father's fellow Millelith, with both the Tianshu and the soldiers themselves coming to visit Jiang'er from time to time to check in on his well-being. Jiang'er himself is unaware of his parents' deaths, even after the Millelith had placed gravestones on the property.
Appearance
Jiang'er is a plump, grown man with shaggy dark brown hair and brown eyes. He wears the Liyue long men's attire, in blue, with a green bamboo shoot printed on its front and back.
Interactable Objects
Shaoyuan's Tomb
(The writing on this tombstone is dense, recording the dates of birth and death of the deceased as well as some details about their life. It's in excellent condition, and there's the smell of wine in the area - someone must have cleaned this tombstone recently and also made an offering of wine.)
Duan'ya's Tomb
(The writing on this tombstone is dense, recording the dates of birth and death of the deceased as well as some details about their life. It's in excellent condition, and there seems to be some flower petals scattered around - someone must have come to pay their respects here recently.)
Notes with Missing Pages
Notes with Missing Pages: "I have gone to Bubu Pharmacy to seek a cure for Jiang'er's troubled mind. I believe we should have the results in a few days..."
Notes with Missing Pages: "Once I have finished my last mission, I will retire from the Millelith and move back home, away from this life of diligence that borders on hypervigilance."
Notes with Missing Pages: "I've given most of my life to the Millelith. If I want to enjoy life a bit now, I doubt the Ministry of Civil Affairs will deny me."
Notes with Missing Pages: "If they don't, it's fine. I'll just take Jiang'er and leave Liyue for good. We'll live carefree lives somewhere else."
Notes with Missing Pages: "Still, I am a Millelith for now, and I must serve until my final watch. Don't worry. Just take care of Jiang'er and wait for my return."</text>

<title>Lingyuan</title>
<text>Lingyuan is an NPC that first appeared in the Chenyu's Blessings of Sunken Jade. After completion of The Cloud-Padded Path to the Chiwang Repose, she can be randomly found at the west of Chizhang Wall and at Mt. Lingmeng with Little Mao. After finishing Rainjade's Benediction, she can also be found at the outside of Qiaoying Village with Fujin.
Profile
Lingyuan is a suanni that presides over Chenyu Vale. She is a friend of the Adepti Fujin and Herblord; however, unlike them, Lingyuan never became close to humanity, preferring to live as a wild beast in the mountains. When the Archon War came to Liyue, Fujin's master caused the Bishui River to flood in a final attempt to defeat Rex Lapis Morax, an act which would have destroyed Chenyu Vale. Seeing this, Fujin and Herblord defected against their god, banding together to save the people of Chenyu Vale. Lingyuan joined the fray in order to back her friends, helping to herd the people of Chenyu Vale to safety. Their efforts would save Chenyu Vale; Fujin "sank into the sea," losing much of her strength, while the Herblord left.
At some point, Lingyuan intervened when Little Mao was being attacked by beasts, saving and befriending him.
In the thousands of years since the war, Lingyuan began to miss her old friend Fujin. Knowing that she was still alive in a weakened state, Lingyuan planned to bring back Fujin's power by disrupting the spirit veins, thereby causing Chenyu Vale to "return to nature." This miasma, if left unchecked, would bring the soil, waters, and forests of Chenyu Vale back to how they were thousands of years ago, letting nature seize control over the land once more and ruining Qiaoying Village's tea industry. During the World Quest series 'Chenyu's Blessings of Sunken Jade', the Traveler and Fujin are able to convince Lingyuan to acquiesce, allowing Fujin to perform the Rainjade Rite and clear the miasma. However, this drains Fujin of her adeptal energy and she reverts back to her original form as a giant carp, returning to her abode at Carp's Rest to recover.
After Fujin leaves to recuperate, Lingyuan asks the Traveler their thoughts on humans going against their purpose, much like how nature does. After their response, the Traveler then asks Lingyuan about her views on humanity, though she is unable to answer. Later on, Lingyuan tries to enter Fujin's abode to check on her friend, but finds herself locked out. This is eventually revealed to be a misunderstanding, as Fujin was embarrassed to have others see her in her original form and had forgotten to unlock her abode while recovering.
Appearance
Lingyuan takes on the appearance of the Solitary Suanni; however, her fur is a darker shade of blue and her whiskers transition from yellow to orange at their tips.</text>

Description
Ruin Machines are ancient machines from the lost nation of Khaenri'ahWe Will Be Reunited and can be found across Teyvat, particularly in the ruins of ancient civilizations. However, these Ruin Machines do not come from the same source as the ruins they inhabit, with a time difference of up to several thousand years.Ruin Guard
Humanoid Ruin Machines take on a Cyclops-like design, though they differ in terms of size and build. Except for Ruin Graders, they speak in an unknown language when attacking. By targeting their weak points - their glowing eyes or, on Ruin Graders, the weak points on their back and feet - they can be stunned, causing them to be temporarily disabled and lie defenseless on the ground. These weak points are immune to attack when circular runes or text appear around them. Ruin Graders are significantly sturdier and are not left as defenseless as their other counterparts.
Ruin Sentinels take on forms of various animals from both real life and in-game. By targeting their weak points - their oculi - they can be stunned, causing them to be temporarily disabled. While not as strong as a Ruin Grader, Ruin Sentinels are more durable than most humanoid Ruin Machines, in that they may need their weak point struck twice, as the first successful hit may simply stagger the machine, whereas a second hit outright disables them like the humanoid ones suffer. Unlike their humanoid counterparts, the Ruin Sentinels willingly expose their weak spot while performing specific attacks.
Ruin Drakes can be find winged or wingless, being modeled on vishaps geovishaps. While performing their signature attack, if it is not interrupted, the Ruin Drake will "infuse" the element they were harmed with the most, causing them to gain increased resistance to that element and apply it to their signature attack when they use it again. If no elemental damage had been inflicted, no infusion is made. Like the previous ruin machines, they can willingly expose their weak spot(s); like humanoid ruin machines, a single hit to the weak spot(s) will disable them instantly. This will also remove the infusion should they had done so previously.
They are usually given distinct letter-number "serial codes," followed by 5 digits. Ruin Guards have a prefix is "Hu-"; Ruin Hunters have a prefix is "Fo-"; Ruin Graders have a prefix is "Ra-"; Ruin Sentinels have a prefix of "Ald-"; Ruin Drakes have a prefix of "Faf-."
Origins
The people of Khaenri'ah called them Field Tillers, a codename based on the saying "The land is not to be tilled with farming tools, but rather to be fought for with steel and blood". Following the fall of Khaenri'ah, the Ruin Machines wandered aimlessly across Teyvat for hundreds of years, mostly ending up in the ruins of former civilizations, causing the people of the present era to mistake them as the guardians of the ruins, hence terming them "Ruin Machines". Some have completely broken down, while others remain active and roaming, or inactive until they sense people nearby.
The first known automaton was a prototype Weird Statue Field Tiller, which Dainsleif states to be stronger than the many created after it, despite sharing the same appearance as them. It is unknown if the Ruin Hunters or Graders were variants improved from the mass-produced series.
Interacting with the inactive Ruin Guards in the Record of Serial No. puzzle gives the decoded message: '"For the nation, we can't forgo this Celestia skyborne power, but we failed."' It is unclear whether these Ruin Machines belonged to the main civilization that dwelt there, Sal Vindagnyr, but current Dragonspine lore attributes the fall of Sal Vindagnyr to Celestia and the dropping of the Skyfrost Nail.
Ruin Machines (Ruin Guards and Ruin Hunters at least) were already being made during or before the Archon War, as the realm created by the adepti in Liyue to store '"several ancient and evil artifacts"' acquired by Guizhong contained Ruin Guards and single Ruin Hunter.Voyage to the Sanguine Sky
As part of the Fatui's research into The Abyss, the Harbinger Il Dottore built a Ruin Guard The Wonderful World Of Mr. Cyclops research facility in Liyue, which remained operational after he deserted the facility out of boredom. According to Tartaglia Childe, these machines are not built by the Fatui, but have some connection to the Abyss Order. He is not clear if the Abyss Order created them or simply took advantage of them.Defender of Childhood Dreams
Ruin Sentinels are animal-like machines which are particularly prevalent in Inazuma alongside humanoid ruin machines. They were also brought into Enkanomiya by the people of Khaenri'ah.
Ruin Machines also appeared in The Chasm (Subregion) The Chasm, with both normal and sentinel-type machines being dug up in the area.Voyage PrepYouTube:
In Sumeru, massive Ruin Machines known as Ruin Golems once prowled the land, who were sent with the Schwanenritter for reasons unknown. These machines dwarf over all other known models; while most features are unknown, they were manually operated by a human crew and were tedious to maintain in part due to their huge size. Three golems currently exist; one at Devantaka Mountain, another at the Valley of Dahri, and a final one at the Desert of Hadramaveth. In addition to Ruin Golems, Ruin Drakes can be found roaming Sumeru alongside the other models.
In Fontaine, a small group of Ruin Machines can be found in Elynas.</text>

Never cook Silk Flower and Sweet Flower together! Turns out it's so sweet it'll give you toothache for three days straight...
Liyue is home to two rival culinary traditions, conveniently named the "Li" and "Yue" styles. Foodies in Liyue are staunch supporters of one style or the other, and have long been embroiled in a bitter battle to prove the superiority of their style.
In this war waged by culinary snobs, ostentation is everything, flavor gets forgotten, and nothing is a simple matter of taste. Much to the consternation of Liyue's chefs, the Li vs. Yue debate eats up all of the region's rare cooking ingredients in the pursuit of ever-more-pretentious dishes.
Born into a restaurateur family, Xiangling inherited her fair share of this consternation. But she also chose to inherit the Wanmin Restaurant and become one of the few to push back against the status quo.
"Good food is good food, period!" Xiangling's mantra is an antidote to snobbery as she sets about creating her imaginative and unconventional dishes.
From a pinch of Mist Flower and a drop of Slime Condensate to a handful of unidentified flying insects and even hilichurls' wooden clubs, Xiangling is known to be somewhat adventurous with her choice of cooking ingredients.
Naturally, her unique approach leads to the occasional disastrous dish. But Xiangling never gives up, because of what her father has always said to her: "There are many secrets to cooking; the most important of which is passion."
Character Stories
"Coming, coming! Here's your Stir-Fried Filet! And your Mora Meat. And Fried Radish Balls, as you ordered."In Liyue, there's a place called Chihu Rock, and there stands a restaurant known as Wanmin Restaurant.One must remain focused if they want to keep moving forward on the bustling streets of Liyue.Unsuspecting newcomers to this place are often lured away by wonderful culinary aromas or lead to peek inside stores by curious sounds.Xiangling, who is both chef and waitress at the restaurant, delivers steaming, delicious dishes to the tables."Sit anywhere you'd like. I can make whatever you want, even if it's not on the menu!"The workers at Wanmin Restaurant can recognize a regular, if not by their face, then by the first sentence out of their mouths.A customer that orders without needing a menu has been at least a few times before. However, if they ask "Is Xiangling the chef today?" then they're definitely a regular.
Xiangling has destroyed many a wok in her time. Either the insides would become irreversibly charred from the heat of a Pyro Slime, or cracks would appear due to flash-freezing from a Mist Flower - or, at some step in Xiangling's unconventional cooking process, a small-scale explosion would reduce it to scrap metal. After some heavy consideration on the part of Chef Mao Xiangling's father, he ultimately decided not to banish his daughter from the kitchen, despite the destruction she caused.As reckless, imaginative, and uninhibited as she may be, it was exactly these traits that led her to create her most successful dishes. "Maybe this isn't so bad..." He tried to convince himself.Suffice to say that payment for a new wok is a regular feature of the restaurant's monthly ledger.
"There are many secrets to cooking; the most important of which is passion."When Xiangling decided to learn to be a chef, her father handed her his own handwritten cooking journal, his life's work. That line was written on the title page.If she was any other person, she would likely have regarded it as some cheesy inspirational quote. However, Xiangling regarded it as a priceless treasure.To her, her father only secured his footing in the forever-ongoing war between the Liuli Pavilion Li and Xinyue Kiosk Yue cuisines by upholding that principle.However, at that time, the conflict between the two styles was white-hot, with many restaurants feeling the pressure that arose from it. Wanmin Restaurant was no exception."Good food is good food, period!"The monopoly on luxurious ingredients such as matsutake and crabs infuriated Xiangling, her angry response to which was to take over in the kitchen.It was time for her to build upon the foundation her father gave her and make some changes."I'm gonna make super-delicious dishes out of any ingredient!"
Xiangling's liveliness is disastrous for the hilichurls of Jueyun Karst. They one day awoke to find their fighting clubs gone.Of course, the flora in Dihua Marsh did not fare any better.After all the work she put in, she finally created some new recipes, such as Hilichurl Club BBQ Fish and Horsetail Sticky Rice and Meat...She'd never create anything new if she just stuck to the recipes of her predecessors.One must break with common conception if they are to carve their own path.When Xiangling finally created her crowning achievement, the Chef's Special Cold-Dressed Fowl, her father paid the price, needing to resort to simple white congee for two days following."Mint and Qingxin Flower seem to induce diarrhea..."She learned a valuable experience to add to her journal.Strange. She ate her own dishes, but nothing ever happened to her. Xiangling did feel guilty though.Maybe it was because she was young and healthy, or had somehow built up a resistance to certain toxins... One may never know.
Whenever a customer asks what exactly was the perplexing creature that follows Xiangling around is, she tells them the story:There was a sudden downpour one day when Xiangling was on her way to fetch some Violetgrass. Halfway there, she was already tired and hungry. She stumbled into a cave, and came across a strange shrine.So she sat down by the shrine, and took out two pieces of Chili-Mince Cornbread Buns spicy cornbread.She gobbled down one, but left the other one on the shrine, intending to eat a little later, but then promptly fell asleep.When she woke up, the other spicy cornbread was gone and a mysterious creature was sitting in front of her, staring."Was it good?"It nodded."More?" She took out some jerky from her backpack.The mysterious creature nodded once again.This was how Xiangling made a new friend. It seemed to be drawn to Xiangling's cooking, as the creature started following Xiangling around wherever she went.Xiangling named it "Guoba," after her favorite Jueyun Guoba childhood snack.
After sampling every dish there was in Liyue, Xiangling's culinary skills drastically improved. Her specialty spicy dishes earned the praise of even her father, a veteran chef with over two decades of experience.She created her unique and complex flavor profile through a generous helping of chili peppers mixed with fruits and herbs for increased aroma. She also created what became the signature dish of Wanmin Restaurant: Black-Back Perch Stew, which combines the richness, color and strong flavors of Li cuisine with the fresh aromas and nutritional content of Yue cuisine.Some have tried to copy her recipes, but try as they might they can never quite reproduce the way her cooking tastes."Braise fresh Violetgrass overnight. Dry, then grind to a fine powder. Sprinkle into any dish for an aromatic boost."This is one of Xiangling's secret recipes, arrived at through a painstaking process of trial and error.In Xiangling's case, that means countless bouts of diarrhea, countless bruised knees bashed on rocky cliffs, and countless wasted potfuls of food that didn't quite turn out as expected.
This map of Teyvat is lined with dense notations in various colors, and if you read closely, you can find the places where Xiangling has been, and where she intends to go in future."The shellfish of the shallows around Guyun Stone Forest are unmatched in their freshness. They say that 'here be sea monsters'?""Sea monster meat tastes great. Should look for Beidou to go fight another one. Will steaming them with eggs make them taste better?""There's a Dvalin dragon in Mondstadt? Great! I just need three days of provisions to get there.""Valberry Valberries are sweet. Lots here. I'll bring a basket. Take some back. See if they'll grow.""This Good Hunter Mondstadt restaurant's Sautéed Matsutake is way too luxurious! They should just sell the matsutake. Ooh, what if I fry some with Jueyun Chili? Sounds good already. Might as well borrow a kitchen tomorrow and give it a go.""Haven't found the dragon yet. Am I in the right place?"...
"You can make something super delicious out of any kind of ingredient."Xiangling earned the approval of a Vision by shouldering this ideal in a wholehearted and unreserved manner. Even when she would make dishes that could be called "horrifying," her desire to keep trying to match ingredients would never waver."Ugh... Qingxin Fried Lizard is actually kinda bad. I think lizards should just be stone-grilled in future.""Slime fried rice is also rather ordinary. Maybe we'll try putting mushrooms in a slime jus next time."Though her friends fell around her during the epic battles with the taste of her dishes and advised her to turn back, Xiangling never stopped thinking about how to turn these "special" ingredients into delicious food.In Xiangling's innocent and persistent heart, as long as they were not poisonous, there were no good or bad ingredients.Her Vision, after all, proves that even the gods approve of such thinking.

<title>Yashiori Island</title>
<text>Yashiori Island ja=ヤシオリ島 ja_rm=Yashiori-jima At some point within the last two thousand years, the island was attacked by the Watatsumi Omikami Orobashi Orobashi no Mikoto, an ancient god who created Watatsumi Island.As a result of the heavy concentration of Tatarigami energy, the island suffers from torrential rainfall and frequent thunderstorms in the open, which in turn applies constant Hydro Wet status. Getting hit by a thunderstorm while raining can cause Electro-Charged. Until the quest Orobashi's Legacy is fully completed, this abnormal weather will remain on the island.

The skeleton of Orobashi a great snake rests on this island. The presence of evil is palpable here. Version 1.5 Special Program
Lore
After Makoto and her twin sister Ei united Inazuma under their rule, none of the remaining gods sought to claim any territory that was not theirs lest they be eradicated by the Archon. Orobashi no Mikoto, known as the Watatsumi Omikami, was one such god. However, for unknown reasons, it suddenly came into conflict with the Shogunate. Orobashi and Ei fought at Yashiori Island, where she slew it using the Musou no Hitotachi and split the island into two, creating the Musoujin Gorge. Orobashi's lingering hatred turned into the Tatarigami, which she suppressed using her wards. The people of Watatsumi Island begrudgingly accepted Baal's rule afterwards, although they continue to worship Orobashi even in the present.
Along with the wards, the Kitain Clan, descended from Kitain Bunsou, took the mantle of the Yashiori Guardians who suppressed the Tatarigami. However, the Kitain bloodline came to an end due to Kitain Hideie's escape during the cataclysm.Absolution-Seeker's TestamentOrobashi's Legacy: Part V
With the implementation of the Sakoku Decree and Vision Hunt Decree, tensions between the Shogunate and the people of Watatsumi escalated into war as the Sangonomiya Resistance formed to openly resist the Shogun's rule. A radical group within the Resistance, without their leader Sangonomiya Kokomi's knowledge or permission, disguised themselves as Shogunate troops to get close to Baal's wards and destroyed them. They believed this would restore Orobashi's "dignity,"Interactable: Narukami Pillar Waterlogged Note Waterlogged Note but all it served to do was unleash the Tatarigami upon the island. Whether they were aware of this would happen or not is currently unclear.
Without the wards to keep them at bay, the Tatarigami began wreaking havoc on the island. The people of Higi Village began succumbing to mysterious illnesses and madness, leaving the village abandoned by the time the Traveler explores the area. Shogunate troops stationed in the area were also badly affected, causing General Kujou Masahito to send a report to his father, Tenryou Commissioner Kujou Takayuki, about the Tatarigami disturbance. Takayuki was furious over what he perceived to be Masahito's incompetence and dispatched an investigation team to report the "truth." Based on the findings of this investigation team, Takayuki was going to consider demoting Masahito and assigning Kujou Sara to the area instead.
Over the course of the Lost Texts found throughout Yashiori Island, the investigation team discovered that Masahito was neither lying nor exaggerating about the effects of the Tatarigami. They began succumbing to the Tatarigami influence and the entire group is now presumed dead or missing.

<title>Foul Legacy Transformation</title>
<text>Foul Legacy Transformation is a combat technique utilized by Tartaglia. He has used it during his boss fight, Enter the Golden House, as well as in a cutscene during his Story Quest Mighty Cyclops' Adventure!. He attempted to use this technique during the events of As Light Rain Falls Without Reason following his guilty verdict by the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale Oratrice, but he was instead incapacitated by Neuvillette before fully transforming. During the events of Masquerade of the Guilty, he would use the technique to prevent the All-Devouring Narwhal from consuming Fontainian civilians.
While under the effects of Foul Legacy Transformation, Tartaglia is able to wield the powers of his Hydro Vision and Electro Delusion at the same time. However, using this ability is extremely draining on him and has lasting repercussions on his body; his fight with the narwhal left him severely injured, resulting in him returning to Snezhnaya in order to recover.ApocalypseFinale

<title>Ayame</title>
<text>Yuna "Umigozen" Ayame ja=「海御前」菖蒲 ja_rm="Umigozen" Ayame ja_lit='Honorable Ocean' Ayame was a historical figure from Watatsumi Island, Inazuma, who lived around 2,000 years ago. She and her older twin sister MouunThe Life of Mouun the Shrine Maiden were descended from the Yuna Clan and were famous across Inazuma as warriors who participated in the Narukami-Watatsumi War.
Ayame was the original wielder of Wavebreaker's Fin. It was separated from her during the war and confiscated by the tengu,Wavebreaker's Fin while Ayame's mansion, the Palace in a Pool located within Suigetsu Pool, was left abandoned and its entrance later sealed after it was covered in seawater.
Profile
Mouun and Ayame were twins born to Watatsumi Island's Yuna Clan, whose lineage began in the depths of Enkanomiya. The two of them took on Akuou as their apprentice and taught him the Yuna Clan's arts, including whalesongs and the rites of Watatsumi.Debates on the "Viceroy of the East" When the Watatsumi people took up arms against Yashiori Island and conquered it for its resources, Akuou, Ayame, and Mouun led the invasion.Everlasting Moonglow At the end of the war, she disappeared into the ocean and never resurfaced.
Story
While Ayame and Mouun were both raised in the Yuna Clan, Mouun became a shrine maiden while Ayame became a diver, making livings by selling the pearls she collected. After Akuou - then a nameless orphan of unknown origins - was taken in by Orobashi, the twins took him in as their apprentice and taught him the Yuna Clan's arts. While the three were close, Akuou and Mouun became lovers and are much more closely associated in historical texts than Akuou is with Ayame.
Narukami-Watatsumi War
Watatsumi Island, having been formed from coral broken off Orobashi's body, never had proper conditions for raising crops. This led to outbreaks of famine and disease, and the Watatsumi people began to view invasion of the neighboring Yashiori Island as the only way to sustain their livelihoods. While Orobashi refused to agree to an invasion out of fear of the Narukami's power (in this case, Ei's),A Preliminary Study of Sangonomiya Folk BeliefTreasured Tales of the Chouken Shinkageuchi he eventually relented to their pleas and suffering. As Watatsumi Island prepared for war, the Divine Priestess at the time put Ayame and Mouun in charge of leading their first navy.
The initial invasion was a success. The Watatsumi forces conquered Yashiori Island and turned it into a vassal state, with Akuou - who at the time became known by the Watatsumi people as Touzannou, or King of the Eastern Mountain - as its king. This attracted the attention of the Narukami Shogunate. Ei took a force with her to repel the invaders, with her tengu general Sasayuri accompanying her.
After a brutal war, the Narukami forces proved superior, although Sasayuri's life was among their casualties. Ei used Musou no Hitotachi to slay both Orobashi and Akuou, while Mouun was ambushed and killed by Sasayuri's subordinates when she attempted to retreat after hearing about the deaths of her god and her lover. Ayame disappeared at the end of the war, leaving her ultimate fate a mystery.</text>

<title>Yelan/Lore</title>
<text>A mysterious person who claims to work for the Ministry of Civil Affairs, but is a "non-entity" on the Ministry of Civil Affairs' list.Elusive, enigmatic, erratic - all of these are Yelan's hallmarks.
Personality
A mysterious person who claims to work for the Ministry of Civil Affairs, but is a "non-entity" on the Ministry of Civil Affairs' List.
Yelan is said to be quite secretive and mysterious; while claiming to work for the Ministry of Civil Affairs, she's frequently absent from work most of the year. Despite this, Ningguang tolerates her general absence while Keqing appreciates her work, although the latter wonders as to where she gets her intelligence from. She employs psychological tactics to catch her targets and get all the information she needs from them.
Outside of work, Yelan approaches life at a calm and carefree pace. She frequently enjoys napping whenever possible, but will adjust her schedule as needed for the day's tasks. The reason for this is because of her physical frailty, a hereditary trait within her family. When handling particularly troublesome cases, she tries to save up her energy to complete everything in a single go.
In the presence of others, she is said to be very pleasant and polite. When alone, she's said to show a far different side of her as an extremely reliable, powerful and intelligent woman. She also has a high tolerance for spice, eating raw or dried Jueyun Chilis after deeming Xiangling's spiciest dish not enough for her. She dislikes sweets, claiming that they're too easy to get addicted to and disrupts focus.
Appearance
The Waning Point
Yelan uses the Tall Female Characters tall female model. She has pale skin, light emerald-green eyes, and dark blue hair and asymmetrical bangs that are lighter at the tips.
Official Introduction
Yelan:The world is vast and infinite, the solitary one comes and goes as she pleases
Oh, you're looking for Yelan? Hmm, I'd like to suggest that you treat her as an ordinary person, but if you do, it's easy to lose control over negotiations. There are some things that really depend on her impression of you.
Yelan's identity has always been a mystery.
Like a phantom, she often appears in various guises at the center of events, and disappears before the storm stops.
The people who are caught up in trouble look forward to meeting her. For some reason, most of them think she will help them, and if not, they want her to be their ally.
But the problem is, their opponents harbor the same idea.
Every one of these people has met a Yelan who goes by a different name and identity, and each of them thinks they can reach a partnership with her. However, everyone has been kept in the dark.
Who does she want to help? When will she tell the truth?
Once she acts and intervenes, nothing can be trusted.
When she reveals her true identity and speaks the truth, those who are eager for answers may not have the chance to hear it.
Character Stories
Liyue's Ministry of Civil Affairs is an organization marked by transparency - from ordinary staff members of the Eight Trades to prominent officials of Yujing Terrace, every employee has their basic information documented in the Ministry's lists.Yelan, despite claiming to work for the Ministry, is the sole exception. Most of her colleagues have never heard of her, nor is her name anywhere to be found on any rosters.This does say something about her character - elusive, enigmatic, and erratic.She is a ghost who walks in the middle of many crises under various names. But before the storms can come to an end, she has already disappeared without a trace.Sometimes, she will pick a side in some conflict to offer her help, but those who receive her aid would be fools to celebrate prematurely, for they soon find that the same help has been extended to their opponents.Having stepped into her trap, many have vowed to take revenge, yet none are able to tell what she is planning, let alone know where she stands.Many believe that she is a spy who works for some mysterious organization, and that her forte is stirring things up in the dark, which she then relies on to attain what she wants.Some even go as far as saying that she is a frenetic follower of disorder who neither serves any organization nor holds any meaningful purposes.Even if she does, all she wants is to add fuel to the already spreading flame and drag everyone down into a world of madness created by her.With so many theories and guesses circulating, she has become a mystery. As for the truth, you could only hope to get an answer from Yelan herself.But unfortunately, this is no easy task either - for it is always she who finds you when she wishes to, not the other way around.
Bubu Pharmacy Pharmacies in Liyue Harbor occasionally receive curious patients.On some days, it might be a Sumeru mercenary, on other days, a Fontaine adventurer, and there might even be some Mondstadt fisher who accidentally fell into water and bumped her head against a rock...These people are of different ages, statuses, and origins, but there is something equally peculiar to them, that is, they all share a slight addiction to pain.They like the stinging sensation when pharmacists apply herbal remedies to their wounds and enjoy the dull pain caused by pressure on their bruises.They even seem to care little if anesthetic is used or not when they are put through painful therapies.Surprised by their extraordinary endurance, novice pharmacists are sufficiently distracted, such that they fail to notice that all their patients are actually the same person.They are, all of them, Yelan in disguise. A master in this art, she always manages to avoid attention.As for the wounds on her person, these are the inevitable result of her constant exposure to danger from mission to mission.Despite the curious job, Yelan herself is not very curious about the world.She eats, sleeps, and lives just like everyone else, but few things can really pique her interest.She is well-read, but she is no avid reader. She always knows what to say to achieve the best result, yet she takes no pleasure in playing mind games.She travels far and roams the lands, yet the traveling and roaming are bland to her.In Yelan's eyes, these things are not hobbies, but a means to an end.She even prefers to roll the dice to decide how she will pass the time.Just as someone who is so used to spicy food might lose the ability to enjoy ordinary dishes, Yelan finds that only spicy cuisine can bring her satisfaction."Blandness is synonymous with blindness, while thrills afford clarity."Acting upon said philosophy, she chooses an acute style of life, venturing into many places while hiding in the shadows.She dances with danger, secrets, and a strong sense of achievement - these are the vivid proof of her existence.
Shorn of her masks, Yelan is a special intelligence officer who reports directly to the Tianquan Ningguang.The title itself is not entirely accurate, for it only covers the scope of her work but not her relationship with the Tianquan.Deep in her heart, Yelan does not think of herself as anyone's subordinate. The way she sees it, she is not so much working for Ningguang as making good on her end of the deal, or rather... she is honoring a certain pact.She plucks the fruits of intelligence from the tree of danger for Ningguang, and in return, all she asks for is danger itself and the sense of achievement.None know when their collaboration began.The only thing certain is that Yelan has long made her presence felt in lands outside Liyue.From other nations in Teyvat to even the perilous Abyss...Every secret and perilous demesne shall become a garden where orchids bloom.Stealthily she roams the night, stars shining upon her in the skies.
Yelan spends much of her time patrolling and roaming The Chasm (Subregion) The Chasm, where she often stares into the darkness deep below.Her family's history dates far back into an ancient age, and her ancestors once fought in The Chasm against a great cataclysm.Wanton death was dealt during that battle, and even Bosacius a yaksha met their end there. Only a few survived the grueling bloodshed.Boyang One of her ancestors died, while the Rongzhao other went insane, constituting a huge blow to her family.Yelan has always wanted to find out what happened back then. Despite her better judgment, she can't help feeling attracted to The Chasm.It almost feels like something that runs in her blood - something inexplicably ominous - has been summoning her to The Chasm.Perhaps she will plunge into that darkness one day, and the ill fate that once befell her ancestors shall find her too.The ominous calling that runs in the family shuts down her fear and turns on her craving for danger. This may be the reason for the peculiarities in her character, Yelan presumed.She had never doubted it until she came of age, until the seal on The Chasm was lifted.With the help of her companions, she unveiled the hidden past of her ancestors.That moment marked a new chapter in her life:In the past, she was a wild beast driven by pure instinct. Drawn to danger, she walked into darkness.From that moment on, she has found the true meaning of her instinct.That which hides inside her, that constant calling, is not only a source of worry but also a light of guidance.It is the blood of heroes which has been howling for 500 years.She has no fear, for the courage within her makes her strong. She craves danger, for the heir of heroes is meant for a great adventure.Some day, she will embark on the path her ancestors once took.She is the descendant of heroes, and she shall become the hero for many who will come after her.
The Ministry of Civil Affairs has a Special Attention List.The list isn't long, but everyone on it is truly extraordinary:For instance, the Beidou unbound and forthright leader of the armed fleet and the Traveler capable outland traveler with a broad range of skills.The list even includes some reclusive adepti in Liyue whose names still bear great weight today...These people could easily bring storms upon Liyue, their intentions notwithstanding.As such, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, ever on guard against risk, still watches them closely.On top of that, there is also a more classified Secret Intelligence List.Those on it are the real threats to Liyue.So who are they exactly?Eleven Fatui Harbingers The Fatui Harbingers? Figures from the Abyss Order?Or perhaps, are even the names of gods listed there?Other than the Qixing, Yelan is likely to be the only one who can answer these questions, for she is the very person who compiled the two lists.The results of such work please her greatly, and day after day, she perfects the lists, as crows embellishing their nests with shining trinkets.That said, while both are equally obsessed with collecting, Yelan must sweat and even bleed to secure what she is after, while crows need only flap their wings to achieve their aim.Fortunately, this does not bother her at all, for she believes that the intelligence is worth whatever cost she is going to pay.One day, the information will come in handy - Liyue will never plunge into disaster without any clue of the danger like it once did 500 years ago.She will see to it that Liyue is not caught unprepared.
Don't play dice at Yanshang Teahouse.If you can't help yourself, play with someone you know.If a lady whom you've never seen before invites you to a game, just ignore her.Heed this earnest advice from veteran gamblers.Do not try your luck with that terrifying woman unless you want to have a gloomy day.The invincible lady of Yanshang Teahouse is none other than Yelan herself, and one of her guises is that of the owner of this teahouse.A while ago when she came back from abroad, Liyue had just weathered the Osial crisis, and the Fatui who had occupied Yanshang Teahouse were now largely out of the game.Yelan seized the opportunity to take it over, turning the teahouse into a secret base.On the one hand, with people from all walks of life to be found here, the teahouse serves as an ideal source of intel. On the other hand, as Yelan has no issue with occasionally giving herself a break, she will pretend to be a regular customer, drinking some tea and playing a few rounds of some game.Every round of finger-guessing is a tiny adventure, and every roll of dice sends sporadic thrills down her spine. Even the smallest challenge is something she can never get enough of.As an intelligence operative, Yelan takes pride in her skills - she is confident that she can read her opponents' eyes and roll the dice such that they fall outside the rules but well within her designs.If there is a draw, that could only mean one thing: Her opponents are cheating too.Don't try to reason with her. The very concept of "reasoning" is simply foreign to the Yanshang Teahouse, nor does it exist in Yelan's vocabulary.Be good and choose between the pain of losing and the disgrace of cheating.You want to have neither, huh? Then why don't you turn the clock back to the very beginning? Don't play dice at Yanshang Teahouse!
Throughout Yelan's intelligence career so far, there has been one memorable operation that fuses both failure and success together.One could say that it was a failure because she lost a family heirloom named the "Fascinating Bracelet" during that operation.The inside of the jade bracelet is engraved with a spell passed through her line that turns the heirloom into a simple communication device. However, the spell requires a pair of such vessels to work. Now that only one bracelet is left, it is no more than a mere accessory.However, the operation also proved a success for Yelan because her enemy did not get the upper hand, either. And this enemy of hers was no ordinary character - it was none other than "Regrator," Ninth of the Fatui Harbingers.Yelan infiltrated a secret trade route that was run by Regrator behind the scenes, intercepting the goods and picking the most precious one of them as compensation for her bracelet.Now, there once existed a strange mystical beast in times of old. A robe made from its fur would be worth a fortune, and due to its rarity, such a robe is exceptionally hard to procure.In fact, the beast is so powerful that although it died centuries ago, its body remains intact today, and its fur still emits a mysterious fragrance.Regrator had intended it as an offer to the Tsaritsa, yet Yelan unexpectedly intercepted it.Not only that, she also rejected the style that Snezhnayans had chosen for their Tsaritsa - she yanked the fur off, combined it with Liyue's Ramie yarn, and made a rather fashionable sleeved mantle for herself.This series of happenings could be seen as significant or insignificant - depending on one's perspective. Ultimately, it all boils down to three words: gains and losses.The cycle of gaining and losing is a rather accurate summary of Yelan's life.None of that really bothers her though. Instead, she takes immense pleasure from it.
Yelan wasn't always on her own. Many years ago, she once had a team who watched each others' backs.There were a small group of people who for various reasons chose to tread a path in the dark with her.But back then, Yelan had not yet realized that her clever tricks and ingenious traps, the skills that she took pride in, could not solve everything for her.Enemies with a strong sense of self-control would not bite her bait, opponents with cunning and calculating minds would not fall for her schemes, and those with overwhelming power would simply strong-arm their way out of her traps.Therefore, Yelan and her team paid the price - one by one, they perished along the way, though they had long foreseen and prepared themselves for such a fate...Still, after a mission to investigate the Abyss, Yelan eventually found herself left alone. For the first time in her life, she stopped, for a long, long time.This state of affairs persisted until one day, when Ningguang visited her in her wood hut personally."You haven't been back to Liyue Harbor for a while. Something must've happened. I can understand if you want to quit."Ningguang stood outside the door, with a serious look on her face but her voice still casual and relaxed."But it's alright. I work with those I trust, and I trust those I work with. I'm willing to believe that you're here trying to find a way out. All postures, aggressive or defensive, are all means to an end, anyway."There was no response, but only a suffocating silence. A long time passed before Ningguang finally heard an answer from behind her:"We both made a mistake: We shouldn't have involved ordinary folk in what we do.""Ordinary folk?"Even as Ningguang was formulating thoughts, a flash of blue shot towards her, stopping as it passed her by.In a display of great control from the archer, the arrow quickly shattered into pearls of water and broke into glistening shards of light before touching the ground.Ningguang turned around and saw Yelan walking up, a bow in hand, blood dripping down from her fingertips.One could only imagine the days and nights of grueling training in archery Yelan had gone through for all her fingers to bleed.Knowing Yelan well, Ningguang also understood that she must have been through an uncommonly tough situation. Only that could explain Yelan's uncommon determination to lock herself up for this grueling re-training.Yelan aimed at the mountain in the distance, a gesture that was also an answer to Ningguang.She released the arrow. Like lightning it shot into the skies, piercing through clouds with might that could shatter the dome of heaven itself. As if responding to the call of an unknown power, waters in the mountains growled and howled, then swirled their way upward in the form of countless arrows.When they met halfway in the sky, they exploded into a curtain of water, bringing down a squalling shower like those that adorned summer nights.As the sky cleared, there was no rainbow, no butterflies to be seen, only a faint pillar of light that fell into Yelan's palm.According to Ningguang, the Vision carries a message: "From today onward, leave all matters to the extraordinary Yelan."

<title>Knights of Favonius</title>
<text>the faction other uses Knights of Favonius (Disambiguation)
An order responsible for protecting Mondstadt and its belief of freedom. Despite its members are known as knights, none has been knighted by any royalty - knighthood is a title they earned from the noble duties they assume. Map description
The Knights of Favonius is the order of knights that protects Mondstadt, founded by Vennessa with the help of Barbatos 1,000 years ago, to prevent aristocrats from ruling the land, as Barbatos originally intended.
The knights act as the lawmen of Mondstadt, keeping its citizens safe and creating and upholding laws for all.
Varka, the Grand Master of the Knights, is currently out of Mondstadt on an expedition with his squad; during his absence, the Dandelion Knight and Lionfang Knight Jean was appointed as Acting Grand Master.
Members follow a strict code of conduct based on the core principles of the Knights, as detailed in the Knights of Favonius Handbook - 5th Edition Knights of Favonius Handbook.
Although they are considered separate institutions, the Knights also help manage the Church of Favonius, which is led by Seneschal Seamus Pegg.
Hierarchy
The Knights of Favonius are traditionally led by a single Grand Master.Sounds From Afar (Quest) Should the Grand Master be unavailable or otherwise indisposed, a second-in-command position exists as a reserve and shall step in to perform the Grand Master's duties as an Acting Grand Master.
Knights of Favonius tradition dictates that the titles of 'Lion' and 'Wolf' were reserved for those of great leadership potential, and that such individuals would one day assume the position of Grand Master.Favonius Sword As such, it may be assumed that the current Grand Master and Acting Grand Master's titles, 'Knight of Andrius Boreas' and 'Dandelion/Lionfang Knight' are specialized variants of the 'Wolf' and 'Lion' titles.
The highest-ranking positions under the Grand Master and Acting Grand Master are the Captains. There is a total of ten Captains, four of which are currently known (Albedo, Eula, Hertha and Kaeya.) Knights typically belong to a company led by one of the Captains or a special group like the Outriders. Although, there are a few exceptions to this like Klee, who doesn't belong to any company and is taken care of by everyone in the Knights of Favonius.
Becoming a squire can be part of the path to knighthood. 16-year-olds are eligible to become squires.Guy
Having a position in the Knights of Favonius doesn't require a person to be a knight either. For example, Sucrose holds the Assistant Alchemist position, but she's not considered a knight.A Riddle Amidst the Crowds

<title>Hu Tao/Lore</title>
<text>Hu Tao is the 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, a person vital to managing Liyue's funerary affairs.She does her utmost to flawlessly carry out a person's last rites and preserve the world's balance of yin and yang.Aside from this, she is also a talented poet whose many "masterpieces" have passed around Liyue's populace by word of mouth.
Personality
The 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. She took over the business at a rather young age.
At first glance, Hu Tao appears to be a quirky and cheerful girl. She enjoys pranking people and despises sitting around and doing nothing. She wishes to live her life to the fullest. Her eccentric and off-the-wall personality often leaves people with a negative impression of her, especially Qiqi, who states that she has a "punchable face" and should be stored in the fridge. In contrast, Xiao enjoys her sense of humor, finding it irritating but interesting.
On the other hand, when handling funerals and last rites, she becomes more solemn and constantly reminds her employees to never deviate from the client's requests. Due to the importance and traditions of the parlor's duties, she expresses a distaste towards people treating her or her employees with suspicion whenever they go to work at night.
Despite her negative impressions, Hu Tao is knowedgeable about the adepti and Liyue's past, having suspected Zhongli to be an adeptus. However, she usually keeps this a secret from those who are unaware for their own safety. Hu Tao accepts death as a natural part of life and tells others to enjoy their short lives. However, she tends to be too excited about death for the means of increasing business.The Mysterious Wangsheng Parlor She also loathes those who try to prolong their natural lifespan, such as Baizhu, though she does not appear to be aware of his intentions for doing so. She also appears to show a lack of interest in her Pyro Vision.
Appearance
Plum Blossom Bouquet
Hu Tao uses the Medium Female Characters medium female model. She has a fair complexion; bright scarlet eyes with white, blossom-shaped pupils; faded red makeup painted at the corners of her eyes; and long dark brown hair fading to crimson at the tips.
Official Introduction
Hu Tao:Look out, Hu Tao's coming through!
It would be best not underestimate someone as whimsical as her. However, should you enjoy surprises, then I believe a visit is in order.
At first glance, she appears to be a quirky and cheerful girl. No one would think that she is actually the renowned and illustrious Hu Tao.
Whether she is acting as the Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor or as Liyue Harbor's "famous" poet, Hu Tao's nature is exceedingly eccentric. Like lightning or sparks of flame, she always comes and goes in the blink of an eye, igniting everything around her.
She pens poems by the oil of midnight and flits across mountains and seas by daylight. She appears at any time and at any place. From bustling streets to barren alleys, to derelict mountains and desolate peaks, in radiant and refulgent skies, or shadowed and starless night... Anything is possible - anything can become full of wonder.
Hu Tao is an undecipherable riddle, but people don't lament their lack of an answer. If asked, they would say, "This is the natural order of things, right? After all, no one can outrun the wind or take hold of a flame!"
She walks the line between life and death, shouldering responsibilities unknown to most mortals.
Be careful around Hu Tao, lest she leads you by the nose!
Character Stories
The 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, a young lady managing the parlor's operations. Despite her position, she's an amiable person who puts on no airs.Her antics are as plentiful as the sand on Yaoguang Shoal. She never ceases to shock people with her countless bizarre ideas.Hu Tao may seem like all play and no work, spending every free moment on leisure and being widely considered a laissez-faire business owner.It is only during funeral ceremonies, when she personally leads her undertakers through lamp-lit alleys, that she shows her dignified and solemn side.
Funeral ceremonies allow mortals to leave this world with dignity. And Liyue's Wangsheng Funeral Parlor is said to be painting the last strokes on the scrolls of people's lives in the most respectful way.Traditional funerals include multiple steps such as holding a wake, burial, putting up a memorial plaque... All of which are subject to strict rules.Regardless of their social standing and level of wealth, all who depart deserve a ceremony that would do them honor. This is the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's client service philosophy.One would think that such a reputable organization ought to be led only by an individual of utmost learning and sagacity.Yet the heavy mantle of the 77th Director has fallen on the shoulders of a young lady like Hu Tao.She has got quite a reputation in Liyue. Whenever someone mentions Hu Tao, their neighbors find it extremely hard to navigate the conversation.Although she is widely praised for her wit and shrewdness, her eccentric notions are not as welcome, as she often lets her imagination run wild.As a three-year-old, she would read through volumes of classic texts while doing handstands. At six, she would cut classes and fall asleep in coffins. When she was eight, she started living in the parlor and learning the etiquette of funeral ceremonies...One would never use the word "measured" to describe her behavior.During her teenage years, Hu Tao was tasked with conducting a funeral ceremony for the first time.The parlor's undertakers and consultants were anticipating her debut with their stomachs in knots as if they were suspended over the peaks of Jueyun Karst.
Fortunately, Hu Tao treats the parlor's operations with the utmost importance and is always looking to grow her business."At the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, the living give us Mora to see the dead on their way. We have a responsibility to both parties, so we gotta make sure both sides are happy."When it comes to the parlor's rules, Hu Tao knows them all like the back of her hand.Each day when the parlor closes its doors, Hu Tao invites consultants from different walks of life to pass their teachings on to the undertakers."The funeral tradition is like science. It cannot be performed based on impressions and personal habits."Of all the lecturers, Zhongli is the most revered one. As such, his lessons have proven to be the most effective in cultivating the competence of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's undertakers.Despite often being teased by Hu Tao due to his old-fashioned style, he is also the person that she trusts the most.Apart from that, Hu Tao always instructs her undertakers to respect their clients' wishes and not insist on any particular form of funeral."Some clients want nothing more than a peaceful ceremony, some opt for a more lively style of event. There are also wealthier clients who would request a funeral arrangement of the most pompous kind. The services we provide have to be tailor-made according to the clients' needs."Ever since Hu Tao took over, the parlor's operations have been solid and reliable, with ceremonies conducted so tactfully that quite a few superstitious people in Liyue have changed their attitudes towards funerals.Even so, Hu Tao still has a tendency to wander off, disappearing as soon as her undertakers are busy listening to lectures.The hobbies and interests of this young director are just as eccentric as her personality, and yet it is difficult to say with certainty if those activities are of a purely leisurely nature.Hu Tao's shadow can be seen in the moonlit docks or at the highest, most precarious viewpoints in the mountains, where she's likely to take in the scenery and shape her thoughts into beautiful poetry.She loves to roam freely at night, looking for inspiration. When it strikes her, no matter where she is, she cannot help but compose a poem on the spot.If they are particularly lucky, the traveling merchants taking respite around the Huaguang Stone Forest can spot a mysterious girl keeping herself amused in solitude.Hu Tao can play a four-player card game accompanied by no one for hours on end.That said, the joys of engaging in such activities remain a mystery to all but Hu Tao herself.
The Ministry of Civil Affairs is guarded by two life-like stone lions, a symbol of power and authority.However, Hu Tao, who happened to be passing by the ministry building one day, saw them in a different light. At first, she examined the lions with a thoughtful look, but soon enough, her pensive face gave way to a wide smile, as she slapped them on the fore-paws.From that moment on, Hu Tao often visited and petted the stone statues. Not only would she talk to them, but also give them pet names - Whiskers for the one on the left and Mittens for the one on the right.On occasion, she would even bring a bucket of water and a big brush to bathe them, each move so careful and deliberate that one might think that they were her actual pets.As it happened, another feline, a living and breathing calico cat, could be found enjoying the local delicacies in front of Xinyue Kiosk, not too far from the ministry building. One day, some city folk came to play with the restaurant's favorite, providing an interesting foil for Hu Tao's peculiarities. Met with befuddled gazes of the bystanders, Hu Tao showed unwavering confidence."Sure, your kitty's cute, but the same can be said about my Whiskers and Mittens. Their fur might be harder, but they're still just as fluffy! Any animal that brings people joy may become a pet. And when it comes to majestic looks, your little fur-ball simply can't measure up to my lions!"Suffice to say that this explanation was met with even greater consternation from the onlookers.Yet the group of people shocked the most and most often by Hu Tao's antics were the ministry guards. Soft footsteps could often be heard in front of the building at around midnight. Initially, the guards suspected that it had been a thief preparing to rob officials. To their unceasing surprise, it would turn out to just be a young lady playing with the stone lions.The guards were faced with an even bigger conundrum when, once everyone had reluctantly got used to her presence, Hu Tao discontinued her visits.That meant that the responsibility for cleaning the statues fell on the guards' shoulders once again.Subsequently, they decided to keep guard by the lions for many days, anticipating Hu Tao's return. Once they finally had the opportunity to ask her why she would not visit anymore, they received the most absurd of answers."Whiskers and Mittens are adults now and can take care of themselves! Excuse me, I'm running late for my heart-to-heart with a Statue of the Seven regarding the meaning of life!"
Not long after her initial meeting with the little zombie, Hu Tao decided that, as her self-proclaimed true friend, she should grant Qiqi eternal peace.Hu Tao would go on to kidnap Qiqi several times following much deliberation in every instance, including calculating the most auspicious time for the ceremony, aiming to follow the standard procedure of cremation, after which she would place Qiqi in a tomb on the outskirts of the city.In fact, she would have succeeded already if not for Baizhu's timely interventions.Each time the Bubu Pharmacy's owner managed to catch up with them, Hu Tao had already had Qiqi packed in a bag, with only her head sticking out, staring in utter confusion as Hu Tao was vigorously digging a hole for the pyre.Afterwards, Hu Tao sent Qiqi an apology letter, in which she expressed deep regret that she had not been able to lay Qiqi to rest fast enough.In Hu Tao's eyes, Qiqi passed away a long time ago, but has been trapped in this world and cannot free herself of her eternal suffering.Baizhu, for his part, had grown ever more relentless in his pursuit of eternal life after meeting Qiqi. This act of defiance against the cycle of life and death was unacceptable to Hu Tao.She wanted to bury Qiqi not only out of consideration for her friend but also to restore the natural order.But Qiqi could not disagree more, as she was afraid of death and disliked Hu Tao for her attempts.Because the struggle between Hu Tao and her had been going on for so long, Qiqi has experienced a breakthrough. She has started to remember places where she might hide to avoid being captured by Hu Tao.Perhaps it was due to those desperate survival efforts that Hu Tao decided to do something unusual and dig deeper into Qiqi's past.The story of her accident and the mystery of the adepti... That series of coincidences filled Hu Tao's heart with hesitation.Since Qiqi's will to live is so strong, she should not be forced to move on. Given the circumstances, she could only be treated as a rare exception that eludes the natural laws.Ever since, Hu Tao's attitude towards Qiqi has changed drastically, to the point that she would pamper her.Unfortunately, the damage has been done and Hu Tao has become Qiqi's bugbear. The little zombie may need several years more to let go of her grievances.
Hu Tao is not, in fact, best known for her role as Director, but for her other great accomplishment: the creation of poetry.She dubs herself the "versemonger of the darkest alleys," and free verse flows forth untamed from her mouth whenever she has free time to be out on the streets.The "Hilitune" is Hu Tao's most famous work, well-loved not only by the people of the harbor, but ever on the lips of children as far as Qingce Village as well.Hobbyists and critics alike were greatly surprised by the simple but profound originality of the "Hilitune" and its creation, and went to Wanwen Bookhouse in droves to search for the works of this great poet. Unfortunately, Hu Tao's anthologies, named "Fiddlesticks" and "Of Common Lives" respectively, have yet to be published.Xingqiu, ever immersed in books, also wanted to meet this strange person, and so chose an auspicious date to visit, bringing a gift with him.The two hit it off immediately, and they exchanged pointers and impromptu poetry in Wangsheng's main hall - and when faced with the poetry of Xingqiu's traditional, artistic bent, Hu Tao could always return in kind with some strange and marvelous verse.And there was meaning in the chaos, indeed, a rhythm to the bizarre that anyone could perceive, and it was catchy, too.Thus did she "beat the old master with untrained fists," leaving Xingqiu at a loss for words.At length, the poetic spar ended amiably, and they have been friends ever since, reading and composing poetry with one another when they have the time to meet.Over time, Chongyun, too, was pulled in to serve as an umpire, their laughter filling the streets.The poems born from these sessions would also be recorded by bystanders.If ever you should hear a pair of matched verses, one strict and the other playful, you are most likely to have heard one created jointly by Hu Tao and Xingqiu.
This hat is somewhat on the hard side, and the insignia of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor adorns its front.It is said that this hat was passed from the 75th Director to Hu Tao. However, that director was large, musclebound, and had a head at least two sizes larger than hers.Ultimately, Hu Tao had to spend an entire day and night to modify the hat with her own hands such that its dimensions would fit hers. When she meets others, she tells them: this hat is magical, upholding good and repelling evil, and is a bringer of peace!The undertakers laugh and leave it at that, but the 77th Director clearly does treasure that hat.No matter the rain or storm, or if Hu Tao returns late covered in muck, that hat will remain spotless and clean.The plum blossom that adorns the side of the hat is plucked from a plum tree that Hu Tao planted and grew herself.Its creation process is as follows: pluck and air-dry, then paint, lacquer, and outline carefully before sun-drying for three days and voila - a beautiful accessory, soft to the touch and bearing a delicate fragrance.
This tale should begin with the funeral of Hu Tao's grandfather.Ten days before the funeral itself, Old Hu had passed away following a bout of illness. For its 75th Director, Wangsheng Funeral Parlor held a grand funeral, in accordance with the last wishes of the old man himself, to be conducted by Hu Tao.Only thirteen at the time, Hu Tao, who would later go on to become the Director in turn, made all the arrangements herself to the highest standard, greatly impressing the undertakers.After the funeral, the thirteen-year-old Hu Tao grabbed her traveler's bag and crept out alone in the dead of night. In her bag were only a few rations, some water, and a means to create some light. She was headed to a mysterious and seldom-seen frontier.Heading straight from Wuwang Hill, one may arrive at the "border." It is the line that separates life and death, the secrets of which have been managed by Wangsheng Funeral Parlor for generations. According to legend, it is a place where the souls of past relatives and the spirits of those with unfulfilled aspirations linger. For Hu Tao, this journey was a chance to see her grandfather once more before he departed forever.For two days she journeyed unceasingly before finally arriving at her destination, yet was unable to locate her grandfather upon arrival. Between the innumerable spirits she walked, but not one of them resembled the old man.She stayed there the whole day before falling asleep in exhaustion, awakening to a night sky and heavy dew. Around her were gathered a few lone spirits, clapping and laughing:"Silly girl, why would Old Hu be here of all places? What were you thinking, looking for your relatives here?"Not one to be swayed so easily, Hu Tao continued to wait, day after day. Her rations gradually disappeared and her water supplies drained away, but her grandfather did not appear. In the end, it was a little old woman who came to her.She laid eyes on the exhausted Hu Tao and smiled as she spoke: "Look at your stubbornness, you're exactly like Old Hu. It's a shame, but none of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor Directors would ever linger here. You come from a family of plain speakers, so let me return the favor... Go back. Go back to where you came from."The old woman bid farewell to Hu Tao, before passing over the border and into the distance. Hu Tao watched as the figure of the mysterious woman grew smaller and disappeared, as a sense of doubt tinged with relief manifested itself.At last she came to the conclusion: her grandfather's absence was due to him having passed over the border as soon as he'd arrived, to the place where he was bound. He had been open and honest in life, leaving behind no regrets, so was it right for his departure to be framed in regretful terms?With a smile, she set forth on the return journey.The faraway moon had been casting a thin light on the way over but had now been replaced by the bright light of dawn. As she walked, Hu Tao thought of a saying that her grandfather had often quoted: "Live in life, die in death. Follow your heart, do what you can."It was noon when Hu Tao arrived home. She climbed over the wall into the rear courtyard, went straight to her room, and unpacked her travel bag.With her food and water long gone, and the rest of her belongings unpacked, the bag she had taken for empty instead contained a colorful Vision. Just when had it arrived?As one of the few living that had dared to visit the border, perhaps Hu Tao's actions had moved some unknown god.Perhaps this then constituted a heavenly gift... the ultimate recognition of her strength.

<title>Coppelius</title>
<text>the playwright the boss fight Icewind Suite
Coppelius was a playwright and historical figure in Fontaine who lived around 500 years ago.Interactable: Institute of Natural Philosophy Ancient Notes Ancient Notes
Profile
Coppelius displayed a talent for playwriting as a child and wrote numerous works, often based on preexisting legends and historical figures. Later in his life, his works all included "eternal beauty" and "eternal love" as themes, which critics in his lifetime noted.Lumidouce Bell His last opera, "Clockwork Coppelia," was never published as the opera house was destroyed on the day that it premiered. Coppelius was presumably among those who died that day.Flowing Purity
Story
Coppelius wrote plays that were either based on true stories or simply from his creativity. One play was loosely based on the fallen noble Parsifal and the Blue-Eyed Spear Witch, who lived during the Mondstadt Aristocracy period, and inspired the stage names for Parsifal the Great and her sister, Josephine.The First Great Magic
"Golden Hyperborea," written later in Coppelius' life, is a fantastical tale about a homesick Lumidouce Bell called "Weeping Crystal," which has its beauty immortalized after being frozen by the icy winds at Hyperborea - the ancient name of the land which is likely now Snezhnaya.Ballad of the Fjords
"Clockwork Coppelia"
Coppelius' last opera, "Clockwork Coppelia," was premiering at the opera house when tragedy struck after the intermission. The opera house seems to have been destroyed that day alongside many of its performers and spectators, Coppelius included. A script was later reconstructed by an unnamed company, based on the memories of those who survived that day and recounted scenes from the opera which were performed before the intermission.
In the published version that was posthumously released, the play featured Coppelius himself. In the first snippet, his plan is exposed to the Marechaussee Phantom Marechaussee Hunters, leading him to be arrested and separated from his creation Coppelia. The second snippet features Coppelia and a young man traveling with her, Nathaniel, discussing Coppelia's weariness with the world and her intention of joining the already deceased Coppelius.
Based on the Institute of Natural Philosophy Ancient Notes Ancient Notes at the Institute of Natural Philosophy - likely written by Dwight Lasker - "Clockwork Coppelia" premiered some time before the cataclysm 500 years ago. The author's first remarks are about how they were looking forward to Coppelius' "new work" and how Coppelius has "always been" talented ever since his childhood - suggesting Coppelius was still alive at this time and might be a former member of Institute of Natural Philosophy - while the fourth paragraph, set an unknown amount of time later, mentions Dwight visiting Basil Elton's grave and a discussion with Emanuel Guillotin, both of whom lived during the cataclysm era.
Legacy
A member of the Fontaine Research Institute named Bossuet was inspired by "Clockwork Coppelia" and created the present-day Boss challenge Icewind Suite. He intended to make then works of art that could transcend the "era of mechanical reproduction". After leaving the institute, the Icewind Suite was taken over by Maillardet, who then added combat abilities for the mechanical dancers.Icewind Suite</text>

<title>Oz</title>
<text>Ozvaldo Hrafnavins, typically shortened to Oz, is Fischl's night raven familiar and companion. Rather unusually, he is capable of speech; currently, the only other known familiars like him are Baizhu's Changsheng and the Traveler's Paimon.
He is summoned into battle through Fischl's Elemental Skill, Nightrider, and Elemental Burst, Midnight Phantasmagoria.
Profile
On Fischl's fourteenth birthday, her peers refused to accommodate her role-playing antics and mocked her for it. She sought comfort from her parents, only to meet similar rejection, just as the "Princess Fischl" in her favorite novel did. Torn apart by her parents' words, she hid herself in the library to cry. It was there that she felt the sensation of being watched, and when she looked up, she saw the night raven before her, along with a Vision - as if reenacting the events of her novels in reality.
According to Oz, Fischl created him and gave him his powers, so he is ostensibly a subconscious manifestation of her Vision's power. Oz also shares a soul and fate with Fischl.
Appearance
Oz has the appearance of a purple raven, with gray/white eyes and a prominent crest, who is capable of summoning Electro energy. He has a similar appearance to depictions of Kapatcir, the long deceased Thunderbird of Tsurumi Island, though naturally far smaller in size.
Powers and Abilities
When summoned into battle, Oz fires bolts of Electro energy at Fischl's opponents. Fischl is also capable of temporarily taking his form, during which she can see through his eyes and fly. She typically uses this ability to survey the surrounding area or to quickly move around in battle.
Oz is apparently capable of traveling long distances without Fischl as well; according to Fischl, he crossed the ocean and brought Sakura Blooms back from Inazuma for her.Mail/Day of Destiny... (2022-05-27)

<title>Kaveh's Father</title>
<text>Kaveh's father is an unnamed character and was a member of the Rtawahist Darshan in Sumeru Akademiya. He married Faranak and had a son with her, Kaveh. His untimely passing twenty years ago devastated his family and had a major influence on Kaveh's upbringing.
Profile
Kaveh's father participated the Interdarshan Championship twenty years ago at Kaveh's urging but did not win. He grew depressed afterwards - for reasons heavily implied to be an encounter with Sachin's consciousness - and left for the desert. He died due to running into quicksand while traveling in the desert.Opening Festivities
Appearance
Based on Sachin's remarks, Kaveh closely resembles his father.To Claim the Crown Faranak's illustration of him with his acquaintances, which Kaveh estimates was drawn over thirty years ago, depicts him with neatly styled medium-length blond hair that trails down his neck and a raised bang. Among his neatly styled hair, a small tuft of hair appears to protrude from the top of his bang.
Story
As a child, Kaveh's father taught an Aranara named Arakasyapa how to read and write in a human script.The Contestant"That Incident From Twenty Years Ago"
Kaveh's father was a member of the Rtawahist Darshan and worked for a time at the Sumeru Akademiya. Over thirty years ago, He met Faranak, who wasn't initially interested in him but changed her mind after he supported her through her artistic struggles despite not understanding her artistic vision. She chose him over all of her other potential suitors, and they eventually married, conceiving Kaveh over 20 years before Chapter III began.Wondrous Times
Kaveh developed an early interest in architectural design from the scholarly backgrounds of his parents, and they bought him block puzzles.
Shortly before the Interdarshan Championship held twenty years ago, Kaveh saw posters for the event as well as the Diadem of Knowledge, leading him to mention the event and how much he liked the diadem's appearance to his father. In response, his father said, "Why don't I win it, so I can let you play with it for a few days?"When the Curtains Close
Kaveh's father became a favorite to win the Interdarshan Championship, but he did not win. It is implied that in the final round, he encountered the fragment of Sachin's consciousness stored in the Diadem of Knowledge and was negatively affected enough that Arakasyapa, who still remembered Kaveh's father and happened to be nearby, took the Diadem of Knowledge and hid it in a tree hollow.'"That Incident From Twenty Years Ago"' indicates that after the final round, Arakasyapa hid the Diadem of Knowledge in a tree hole in order to protect the human who taught it how to read, who is suggested in 'The Contestant' to be the same person who helped Aaru Village and died in quicksand. 'When the Curtains Close' shows that the human spoken of in 'The Contestant' is Kaveh's father, as deduced by both the Traveler and Alhaitham.According to Wiqas in 'Sachin's Article', the Diadem of Knowledge "carries a secret that no one knows"; the secret is likely related to the mental experience Kaveh had with Sachin's words and emotions due to the Diadem of Knowledge, as shown in 'To Claim the Crown', explained by Kaveh himself in 'The Arc of Intellect', and further supported by Kaveh's declaration in 'When the Curtains Close' that with the diadem shattered, Sachin's words will never hurt anyone again. This makes it likely that Kaveh's father had the same experience as Kaveh. However, the damage had already been done, and Kaveh's father fell into depression.
Upset by Sachin's research, Kaveh's father requested to join an investigative research project in the desert and offered his assistance to the people of Aaru Village, teaching them and supplying them with what he could. He also ventured beyond Aaru Village in search of the Nagarjunites. At some point, he began to write a letter to Kaveh. Kaveh's father eventually ran into a caravan trapped in quicksand and saved many people at the cost of his own life. His unfinished letter to Kaveh was taken by Rishti's son in hopes of delivering it, but the letter was presumably taken and never delivered after Rishti's son was killed in a scuffle a few years later.A Whole New Style
Legacy
The death of Kaveh's father led Kaveh to carry massive guilt and lose the ability to put himself first and accept pure goodwill, persisting even to present day.
He, along with Faranak, had a significant influence on Kaveh's interest in architecture from an early age, with them encouraging his interest by purchasing a sketchbook and building blocks for him to play with. He also entered the Interdarshan Championship to win the Diadem of Knowledge for Kaveh to play with after he expressed interest in it due to its shape, suggesting that he encouraged a young Kaveh's developing interest in aesthetics. Kaveh grew up to be an aesthete, and after completing his magnum opus, the Palace of Alcazarzaray, which combined architectural practicality and aesthetics, he rose to national prominence in Sumeru.
Kaveh's father's financial and medical assistance to Aaru Village saved it in the long run, earning him a positive reputation among the village residents. However, because it has been twenty years since the incident, even those who remember his good deeds are slowly beginning to forget or no longer care about what he had done.

<title>Kaedehara Kazuha/Lore</title>
<text>A wandering samurai from Inazuma with a modest and gentle personality.
Beneath a youthful and carefree demeanor lies a heart that hides a great many burdens from the past. Seemingly easygoing, Kazuha has his own code of conduct.
Personality
A wandering samurai from Inazuma who is currently with Liyue's Crux Fleet. A gentle and carefree soul whose heart hides a great many burdens from the past.
Kazuha is a polite and well-spoken person. Unlike other noble Inazuman clan members, he prefers going out and traveling rather than staying put indoors, something that he is able to do due to the seizure of his clan home. He once roamed Inazuma peacefully as a modest wanderer for a good portion of his life, teaching himself bladework and picking up other skills. Never seeking luxury, he is instead easily pleased just by sleeping on a sun-warmed rock. The time he has spent outdoors makes him attuned to nature and the wind, being able to "hear" and "smell" everything around him with absolute clarity. He can sense dangers, read people and track them down in an instant no matter how well they try to conceal it. Due to this sensitivity he prefers calm weather and never stays in one place for too long, having trouble sleeping for the formerKaedehara Kazuha and having his skills stagnate for the latter.
Kazuha firmly believes that everyone is entitled to their hopes and dreams and that no one has the right to take them, not even a god. For this reason, he opposes the Raiden Shogun and those who support her. Despite his values, he isn't prideful and can acknowledge the strong fighting prowess and honorable conduct of those he personally disagrees with. He sees his friend's duel as honorable and noble, but also considers his subsequent execution by the Shogun to be both fair and justified. Kazuha is determined in his goals, pursuing them with thoroughness and cunning, but he also takes his time and is easygoing. He is very reflective and thoughtful about all matters, frequently pondering about various topics in his travels. He holds his relationships in high regard, immediately coming out of hiding for Kazuha's Friend his friend and forever grateful to Beidou and Gorou for taking him in when he needed shelter. Kazuha frequently warns others of coming storms and possible trouble. He happily does simple errands, offers advice, and is willing to help others.
After the death of his friend and joining the The Crux Crux he was quiet and wouldn't speak to any of his crewmates, but he eventually warmed up to them and according to Beidou is fairly chatty. Kazuha has a poetic side and enjoys penning haikus, though he claims to not be especially talented at it. As a result of both traveling many places and sailing for long periods of time, Kazuha has grown particularly fond of readily available grilled fish and takes the time to prepare and finish his food slowly. While he is not picky about what he eats, he does not appreciate rushed meals or lazy cooking methods. His most prized possession is his sword that he keeps with him at all times, a source of pride for Kazuha as both an Inazuman and a samurai. He is also incredibly fond of red maple leaves, finding them beautiful and enjoys seeing them rain during autumn. When unable to view such sights, he frequently collects and carries them as a memento to ease any homesickness.

Official Introduction
Kaedehara Kazuha:Enchanted by the Birds and Blossoms, He Wanders the Moonlit Path
If one's heart is empty, all under heaven is empty.But if one's heart is pure, all under heaven is pure.
A wandering samurai from Inazuma with a modest and gentle personality.
Beneath a youthful and carefree demeanor lies a heart that hides a great many burdens from the past. Seemingly easygoing, Kazuha has his own code of conduct.
Kazuha leads a wandering life, setting out on his journey in the day, and sleeps with the sky as his blanket and earth as his bed in the night. Wealth has never been his pursuit, and regardless of summer or winter, what he seeks has always been true peace in his heart. Despite the wilderness being his home, he never worries about the impending rain or storm. It is as if rainstorms are afraid of him, because they do not dare to cross his path.
Out of curiosity, someone asked about this talent and Kazuha answered with absolute honesty - reading the sounds of nature is a unique ability of his. People do not usually pay attention to the weather, so it is no surprise that they are unable to discover the signs it reveals. However, given Kazuha's skill, he can sense the arrival of snow and rain immediately with just a gust of wind or abnormal humidity. That is when he knows it's time to seek shelter.
Kazuha, who has traversed around the lands, has avoided countless torrents of storms and flashes of lightning. This time, however, what awaits him will be an unprecedented thunderstorm. This time, he will no longer seek refuge. He, the rain, and the lightning will meet at the intersection of fate, as destiny marks it.
"-- I hear a storm strike far and distant, with only a whisper light and faint. From the sky there falls no rain, thus here I shall still remain."
Character Stories
Most people who meet Kaedehara Kazuha for the first time might be inclined to assume that he is just a trainee sailor with the Crux Fleet.After all, he is a gentle soul who enjoys reciting poetry when idle, and who speaks to everyone in a leisurely manner. Who could tell that he is a wanted man throughout Inazuma?Even Beidou, ever the good judge of character, could not tell that Kazuha could wield a sword with the skill of a seasoned warrior when she first decided to take him in.Who knows if it was the storms of life that smoothed out his rough edges, or if his natural restraint has kept his edge sheathed.
The Crux, an armed fleet from Liyue, spends much of the year on the high seas, and its sailors are quite used to the vagaries of life in other nations. So they were more curious than surprised when an outlander began serving as a sailor on their flagship, the Alcor.The sailor in question was picked up when the Alcor docked at the Inazuman port of Ritou.Beidou had made friends with this young man, and when he came on board, she told her crew, "This guy's gonna be staying with us for a while. Take care of him, now."The sailors trusted Beidou's judgment and admired the newcomer for his martial prowess, not to mention his ability to predict the weather, so they were happy to overlook his reticence to discuss his past, and welcomed him aboard.Still, their curiosity did not abate, and they would often find all sorts of excuses to try and ply him for information about his experiences."I've heard that they make some sweet blades there in Inazuma and that the bigger the fish you are, the swankier the sword. So, uh... how's yours measure up?""..."Kazuha would remain silent in the face of all such queries.Over time, after countless attempts to garner a response proved futile, the sailors would simply give up asking.Eventually, it was an off-the-cuff remark from Chief Mate, Juza, just a few days later that finally managed to elicit a reply."Hey, Inazuma boy. What are the lads supposed to call you if they don't even know your name?"The young sailor wiped the sweat from his brow with his callused hands."My name is Kaedehara Kazuha, a wandering samurai. I am in your debt for taking me in, so just call me 'Kazuha.'"
Kazuha was not born a commoner. He hails from an Inazuman noble house of old, the last son of the Kaedehara Clan.Inazuma City is home to many illustrious clans, and the Kaedehara name was once one of the most renowned among them. But fortune is fickle, and the Kaedeharas' fortunes had already collapsed by the time they were Kazuha's to inherit.As the young master of the house, Kazuha could do nothing but watch as his family's future crumbled around him. But as helpless as this made him feel, when the moment came that the home was officially repossessed and the last attendant was finally dismissed, he breathed a sigh of relief: As far as he was concerned, this was a golden opportunity to begin leading a free and wandering life.He had always longed to roam the mountains and forests, and had held a deep admiration for the beauty and authenticity of nature since his youth.To Kazuha, nature had never been silent. It had always spoken to him, conveying its feelings in its own unique language.When the wind ceases to speak and the world falls silent, that is the calm before the skies begin to weep. When silent springs suddenly leap into activity, it is the omen of a great earthquake.These are the unique poetics that nature has bestowed upon him, and Kazuha was never one to be preoccupied with luxury anyway - so if the burden of family responsibility should drop from his shoulders, why not go wandering, and travel light?Thus did Kazuha strike out on his journey, like a falling leaf in the yard carried away by the wind.
All travelers who outdoors roam need some skill to call their own. For Kazuha, this is his ability to read the sounds of nature.After leaving Inazuma City, Kazuha wandered here and there. Things were different now: all of nature was his treasured home, and the sounds of wind and water beneath the sight of drifting clouds set his heart at ease.All that he saw on the road filled him with curiosity. It was in this state of mind that Kazuha arrived at a mountain in the south.It was early summer, and the frequent and heavy rainfall had turned the mountain roads to mud. Seeing that night was soon to fall, Kazuha decided to find somewhere to shelter from the rain. No sooner had he had this thought than he turned around to see a small straw hut at the far end of the road.The traveling merchant with whom he was traveling at that time whooped for joy at the sight of the hut: "Kazuha, look! We'll have a roof over our heads tonight!"But Kazuha did not speak. He paused and listened intently for a long while before he finally replied: "If you were to ask my opinion... it may be best to stay away."But the merchant did not wish to remain in the rain. He left Kazuha and made his way to the house.Upon knocking at the door, the traveling merchant was met by a lovely woman who offered him shelter, tea, food, and even bedding for the night.Perhaps it was the excellent food, but the merchant quickly became drowsy and fell asleep immediately after finishing his meal.When he awoke the following morning, there was no roof over his head. The bright sunlight pierced his eyes, and all he could see was Kazuha standing nearby, looking down at him and smiling.Before the merchant could speak, he vomited a great pile of leaves and mud. And as for the bedding upon which he had slept so soundly, ah, it too was mud.Kazuha smiled and said: "The wind is weaker where there are houses. Yet here stood a hut, and there was no change in the mountain breeze. I think you might have been the victim of a bake-danuki's prank. Never mind. Next time, listen more closely to the wind and tread with care."
Kazuha made many friends during his travels. Kazuha's Friend One of them was particularly close to his heart, and for a time, the two journeyed together.But they too would part, for their destinations were different.To have met merely by chance and then form such a strong bond, there must be a fated connection between them... so, although they would part ways for now, surely they would meet again. Or so Kazuha thought.But something happened soon thereafter that would shatter his calm disposition - the The Shogun Almighty Shogun promulgated the Vision Hunt Decree and swore to retrieve all Visions.All who wielded them, including Kazuha, were stricken with panic, concealing their identities and going into hiding.It was then that Kazuha received shocking news: Someone had dared to call for a "duel before the throne," and that someone was none other than Kazuha's dear friend.The defeated party in a duel before the throne would face punishment at the hand of the Shogun herself. His friend was prepared to risk all to come before the throne, partly for the chance to fight against a strong foe, but also to demonstrate the meaning of courage to all.And yet, to call for this challenge now, of all times... Kazuha feared that his punishment, should he fail, would be absolute: The Almighty Shogun would unleash her lightning upon him in its full fury, and it would surely take his life.Even the normally calm Kazuha could not restrain himself. He drew his sword and stormed into Tenshukaku like a whirlwind... But alas, he arrived too late.His friend's sword lay shattered in pieces, his Vision now an empty husk. Now a wanted man himself, Kazuha fled with grief in his heart.From that moment on, the days of peaceful wanderings were over, and Kazuha's life became an unending series of battles.Kazuha did not fear battle, of course, but the constant fighting left him feeling lost and perplexed.He did not regret having set out on his doomed rescue mission, nor did he begrudge his friend for leaving him, but he could not help but think..."Is this endless conflict truly the only way to assert one's ideals?"
The Crux Fleet became Kazuha's new home, and he drifted on the ocean wherever it took him.Trouble still found him from time to time, but no issue was insurmountable with the support of the Crux crew.From his vantage point on the Alcor's crow's nest, gazing out at the azure sea and sky, he finally had the space to think over the tumultuous events of his past and what it all meant to him."Every samurai wishes to live their life with passion and to claim the greatest reputation possible using the sword in their hands.""But there will always be those whose base desires lead them astray from the path of justice and virtue, and whose blades leave an endless trail of enmity in their wake.""Surely the heavens did not give us fleshly forms and the gods did not watch over our lives all so that we might take up arms against one another.""Then, this sword I wield is not meant to slay, but to save...""Yes, this shall be my path as a samurai, and I shall defend it all my days."As he reached the conclusion of his thoughts, Kazuha was suddenly inspired to pen down a few verses to serve as a maxim for himself thereafter... but before he could get started, he was interrupted by an irate voice from down below:"Hey, Kazuha, quit gawking at the sky - get down here and lend a hand!"It seemed the maxim would have to wait for another day. Whatever the helmsman, Sea Drake, needed help with clearly couldn't wait.
Kazuha was just as surprised as everybody else when the Vision briefly lit up during that great battle.For in all the time that he had spent searching high and low trying to find someone who might rekindle it, never had he imagined that he could be the one to cause its light to shine once more. It was almost as if his late friend were lending him his aid from behind the scenes.This empty shell of a Vision not only proved this, but had also brought him many fateful encounters along the way:He had been aided by the resistance, saved and taken in by Captain Beidou, and he had even met the fabled Traveler...In life there were seasons of hopelessness and desperation, but there were also moments of great serendipity.His journey was like the rise and fall of a mountain path - at times, the struggle was all but too much to bear, but there would always be moments when he would touch the clouds.
The morning mist covered the mountains like a blanket as Kazuha trod a small trail alone.The world was silent. Not a single feather flapped, and not a single cicada sang.Even the roiling waves seemed to have fallen into slumber, leaving just the faint whisper of the wind audible against the silence. Kazuha stuck out his tongue - the air tasted heavy and gloomy.This told him that it would soon rain.He peered into the distance and spotted a plume of smoke up ahead. Below it were several straw huts. Tonight, it seemed, he would have a roof over his head.He informed the Yasuda owner of the house that a storm was coming. At first, he was met with skepticism, but come noon the rains arrived right on cue.In awe of this wanderer's skill, the master of the house eagerly offered him lodging.The storm raged into the night. Kazuha held his quilt close, and as he listened to the onslaught of rain against the autumn leaves, his mind began to wander.In the time since the Kaedehara Clan's fortune had faded away and he had set off on his journey, Kazuha had traveled across many of Inazuma's islands and had become intimately acquainted with the plight of the wanderer.Moving between islands usually necessitated traveling by sea. Kazuha would make these trips alone, in a small, slow boat, making things all the more perilous when he had to battle against strong headwinds or violent thunderstorms...And yet, there was limitless fascination to be found in this same journey of his, where the vast sky and boundless earth was his home, and all living things that inhabited them were his friends.If one's heart is empty, all under heaven is empty.But if one's heart is pure, all under heaven is pure.With his sword in his hand and his chosen path in his heart, he could go on his way with a song on his lips and with nothing to fear, no matter the perils he may face.Kazuha slept soundly that night, his mind at rest having made peace with his feelings.The next day, he awoke to the sound of birds... and a shining Vision lying upon his chest.

<title>Asase Hibiki</title>
<text>Asase Hibiki ja=浅瀬響 ja_rm=Asase Hibiki was a shrine maiden who lived around five hundred years ago.A Nazuchi Beach Pirate's Diary  4 Pirate's Diary on Nazuchi Beach, written by present-day pirates, states that Ako Domeki lived five hundred years ago. In Hamayumi, Hibiki offers Domeki her assistance. She traveled from Asase Shrine on Seirai Island to the Grand Narukami Shrine on Narukami Island to develop her techniques as a shrine maiden,NekoHakushin Ring where she was mentored by the Kitsune Saiguu and became the love interest of Takamine the Mistsplitter. Takamine and the Kitsune Saiguu's disappearances over the course of the cataclysm deeply affected Hibiki and several others who were associated with them.Shimenawa's ReminiscenceEmblem of Severed Fate
Shimenawa's Reminiscence and the Storm Cage piece in Emblem of Severed Fate are told from Hibiki's point of view. She was also the wielder of Hamayumi, and came into possession of Thundering Pulse as part of her wager with Takamine.
Profile
Appearance
Assuming that Shimenawa's Reminiscence (Equipment Card) depicts her likeness, Hibiki had brown hair tied back into a ponytail and wore the Grand Narukami Shrine's red-and-white Miko clothing.
Story
In her youth, Hibiki went from the Asase Shrine to the Narukami Shrine. While initially distrustful of the Kitsune Saiguu, she eventually came to hold great respect for the other woman. Because the Great Tengu Reizenbou served as the Kitsune Saiguu's bodyguard, Hibiki also became acquainted with Reizenbou's servant Takamine. Despite being exasperated by his antics and nicknaming him "the idiot Konbumaru" to hide her affection towards him, the attraction was mutual and two grew close: he taught her the tengu archery he had learned, while she made an undisclosed promise to him.Given how the elderly Hibiki eventually entrusted Ako Domeki (who resembled young Takamine very much) with a wish to see the world, it is possible that her promise to Takamine involved seeing the world outside Inazuma together.
Hibiki was not the only person to train at the Grand Narukami Shrine during this time; Kamuna Harunosuke and Mikoshi Nagamasa also trained under the Yougou Tengu, leading them to be collectively known as The Yougou Three.The Narukami Trail
Takamine eventually became a Hatamoto, or a high-ranking samurai, for the Raiden Shoguns Makoto and Ei.While the Electro Archon was officially Makoto at the time, Ei assumed the role of the Raiden Shogun for military affairs. People did not officially know there were "two 'Raiden Shoguns,'" as Ei puts it in 'Cleansing Light', so references to the "Raiden Shogun" before Makoto's death do not differentiate between them. Despite his attraction to Hibiki, he married another high-ranking samurai's daughter instead. Much to Hibiki's consternation, he never lost his habit of wandering or gambling despite his rank and marital status.
The Cataclysm
When the cataclysm threatened Teyvat, Takamine and Mikoshi Chiyo, Nagamasa's adoptive mother, were among those who embarked on an expedition to the Abyss alongside Ei.Thundering PulseCleansing LightWeapon Ascension Material: Mask of the One-Horned'He [Torachiyo] was once a beloved lieutenant of the Shogun, and he followed her into the dark abyssal realms to repel the defiled ones [...]'; Mask of the Kijin reveals that the story of "Torachiyo" is actually Chiyo's story, distorted over time. Before leaving, Takamine promised his "future" to Hibiki by entrusting Thundering Pulse to her as a wager for his triumphant return.Mistsplitter Reforged
However, this never came to pass. Takamine disappeared in battle, while Chiyo went insane from abyssal corruption and attacked Ei, only to be defeated and afterwards fled, never to be seen again. This betrayal tarnished the Mikoshi Clan's reputation and Nagamasa joined the Shogunate to restore his family's honor.The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call Escher: After all, Nagamasa is the adopted son of Mikoshi Torachiyo, the youkai struck down by the Shogun's own hand. If he truly seeks to redeem his family's honor, an abundance of caution is well-advised. The Kitsune Saiguu, who had taken up the task of protecting Inazuma in the Raiden twins' absences, disappeared and eventually perished against the dark forces. Reizenbou went on a self-imposed exile for her failure to protect the Kitsune Saiguu while Harunosuke left Inazuma out of his grief and rage, heading to Liyue to learn the adepti arts. The Yougou Three parted ways, never to cross paths again.
After the Cataclysm
'Note: The order in which the following events occurred is currently unknown.'
Much time after the cataclysm passed, Takamine finally emerged from the Abyss and returned to Inazuma. He encountered Hibiki at their promised location in Chinju Forest and though he was overjoyed at their reunion, she pierced him through with a barbed arrow and killed him. She believed he was inevitably and irreversibly corrupted by the Abyss' defilement and had long sworn to "save" him by "exorcising folly and needless obsession."
Hibiki retired back to her birthplace at Seirai Island, managing Asase Shrine with the help of Neko and the pirate captain Ako Domeki. She told them stories of her past and of her wish to go see the world, though she never mentioned the tragic endings of Takamine and her other friends."The Catch" During Domeki's and Seirai Island's rebellion against the Shogunate, Hibiki chose to assist him due to their friendship and his resemblance to Takamine. She decided to use the "true magic'" she learned from the Yougou Tengu to unseal the great barrier containing Kanna Kapatcir'sThe Sun-Wheel and Mt. Kanna remaining resentment and use it to destroy the Shogunate's ships.Hamayumi This decision resulted in the catastrophe that caused the massive Electro storm over Seirai Island, and likely cost Hibiki her life, as she never returned from that storm.Seirai Stormchasers: Part I
Legacy
While Ako Domeki and his fleet also went into the storm, Domeki and some of his crew survived. His chief mate Janome and the ship carrying the Maguu Kenki he defeated were blown away to the Golden Apple Archipelago while protecting him. What exactly happened to Domeki is unknown, but he eventually made his way back to Seirai Island, only to find it in its current inhospitable state. He made a vow to Janome and Hibiki to live as the "freest person in the world" and experience the world like Hibiki had always wished to, and set off for parts unknown.
Asase Shrine was the only place on Seirai Island unaffected by the Electro storm and Neko has remained there ever since, watching over the many generations of cats that have been born at the shrine. She awaits Hibiki's return, unaware that as a human, Hibiki would have died long ago; she also does not understand why people stopped coming to the shrine - they had been evacuated from the island - and enlists the Traveler's help in repairing the shrine in hopes of attracting more visitors.Neko Is a Cat

<title>Guoba</title>
<text>the character Xiangling's Elemental Skill Guoba Attack
'Stove God redirects here. For the current holder of the title of God of the Stove, see Rex Lapis.'
Guoba zh=锅巴 zh_rm=Guōba is Xiangling's friend and companion, who assists her in battle with Guoba Attack.
Guoba was originally a god known as Marchosius, the God of the Stove and Patron God of the Soil. He was among the gods who resided at the Guili Assembly, alongside Morax and Guizhong. After the nation's destruction during the Archon War, he was among the survivors who went on to establish Liyue Harbor. However, following a series of calamities, he used up his power to vitalize the land, greatly reducing his physical size and intelligence.
Profile
The god Marchosius was one of the gods who helped the Guili Assembly flourish thousands of years ago.Three to Get Ready, and Here We Go animated cutscene Around 3700 years ago, in the midst of the Archon War, the Guili Assembly was destroyed by a battle that resulted in a massive flood.Stone Tablet Compilations: Vol. I Marchosius and the adepti accompanied Morax and their people to what is now Liyue Harbor.
Centuries later, Marchosius would sacrifice his power to save Liyue from calamities and plagues. Leaving Morax and Madame Ping with his recipes and secrets of the flame, he retired to the mountains and fell into a deep slumber with both his physical body and intellect greatly reduced. He slept for several centuries, and over time the people of Liyue merged the legends of the God of the Stove into that of Morax's.Legend of the Geo Archon: God of the Stove
One day, Xiangling stumbled upon a mysterious shrine while searching for Violetgrass. The girl, tired from her journey, fell asleep after snacking on a piece of Chili-Mince Cornbread Buns Chili-Mince Cornbread Bun; she left the rest of the cornbread on the offering table, intending to eat it later. By the time she woke up, she found a strange creature instead - and he had eaten her cornbread. Undeterred, Xiangling gave him some more food, and he thereafter began following her around. She named him Guoba (scorched rice), after her favorite childhood snack. Unbeknownst to her, she had found one of Liyue's ancient gods.
Appearance
Guoba takes the form of a bipedal, orange panda-like creature. A symbol resembling a combination of a Geo and Pyro symbol can be seen on his back.
Powers and Abilities
Guoba has the power to create fire, which is apparently a manifestation of his inability to handle spicy foods despite his fondness for them.Guoba Attack Guoba is capable of controlling the strength and heat of his flames, and has either been trained by Xiangling or instinctively knows when to adjust his flames while cooking.Chinese HoYoLAB:  His control over flame is high enough that he can use his flames to scorch off pig bristles without burning the meat.Chinese HoYoLAB:
He apparently has the power to create chili peppers: He spawns with one (and eats it) at the start of Guoba Attack, while Xiangling talks about frying up "one of Guoba's chili peppers" in one of her voice-over lines.
Story
History
Marchosius was one of the many gods of Liyue; he helped establish the Guili Assembly alongside Morax and Guizhong, making him over 3700 years old. He held a deep love for humanity, splitting his body into minions that would enter people's homes to light up stoves, help them cook, and bring warmth to everyone. When the Archon War broke out, even the combined might of several gods and the adepti was not enough to save the Guili Assembly from a battle that ravaged the plains. In the aftermath of the battle came a great flood that devastated the Guili Plains and rendered it uninhabitable. Marchosius accompanied Morax and the adepti as they relocated what remained of their people south of Mt. Tianheng - a journey which, while not long in and of itself, was greatly setback by a powerful storm. During this time, Marchosius developed the recipe for Chili-Mince Cornbread Buns, which he spread among the people.Rice Buns may be also his invention (or at least an invention based on his cuisine), because the recipe of Rice Buns is sold by Chef Mao and in the Chinese version both buns are referred to as (synonyms for) 'wotou', a type of steamed bread in Northern China.
After Liyue Harbor was established, Marchosius lived among the people like he previously had. However, Liyue Harbor too was beset by disaster and plagues, this time caused by the lingering hatred of ancient gods defeated over the course of the Archon War.It is currently impossible to tell when exactly Marchosius sacrificed his power and fell asleep. However, in the Moonlight Merriment animated cutscene, Madame Ping's recount of his sacrifice is juxtaposed with an illustration of Rex Lapis used during the 'Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti' cutscene in Xiao's first Story Quest. Marchosius placed all of his power into the land itself to keep it vitalized, greatly diminishing the size of both his physical form as well as his mental faculties. With the last of his abilities, he imparted his recipes and secrets of the flame to Morax and Madame Ping before retreating to a mountain shrine and falling asleep.
Legacy
Marchosius would eventually reawaken when Xiangling, who was seeking Violetgrass, sought refuge in his cave from the rain outside and encountered his mysterious shrine. She left her remaining Chili-Mince Cornbread Buns cornbread bun on the shrine before going to sleep. He would be awoken by the smell of the bun and ate it, which Xiangling noticed when she woke up. While Marchosius had forgotten most of his memories and could no longer speak, he was still capable of remembering what was familiar to him, which was the aroma of the bun. Xiangling took Marchosius with her and called him Guoba.
There are few historical records on the Stove God, and the existing ones are confusing. Some - such as Musheng and Sheng - believe that the Stove God was another title for Morax, while others believe the Stove God was a separate deity.
Keqing's grandfather described the Stove God Festival as the practice of paying tribute to the Stove God, and that the Stove God Festival was one of many festivals unified into the modern Moonchase Festival.
According to Chongyun, there was a text mentioning that the Stove God appeared in the Guili Assembly. According to Xingqiu, there is a text "Demystifying the Legends of Liyue" on the Stove God. Based on a text received from Smiley Yanxiao at Wangshu Inn:One for the Foodies, Two for the Show
At some time prior to the start of Moonlight Merriment, a mysterious stone was found and brought to the Liyue Qixing. The stone eventually cracked open, and Madame Ping revealed that the statue was actually a depiction of Marchosius during his glory days.

<title>The Eremites</title>
<text>The Eremites are a group of people who hail from Sumeru's desert region. Most of them are mercenaries by trade and conduct business across Teyvat.A Particularly Particular AuthorA Visitor From Westward Realms
Overview
Rather than a 'hero,' I'd call myself someone who 'isn't afraid of dying so that they might truly live.' This was something that a senior from Sumeru told me, and she herself heard it from the Eremites.|Zhiqiong
The Eremites hail from the ancient, now-collapsed civilizations of the Great Red Sand.YouTube: '' They are split into multiple factions and tribes, each with their own beliefs and codes of conduct, although these factions are not always mutually exclusive. Strife sometimes erupts between different Eremite groups, which is why consultants and advisors are appointed by Rukh Shah to facilitate communication. In fact, the name "Eremites" is simply a blanket term for all of the tribes of the desert, ignoring any of the distinctions between said tribes.Eremite Scorching Loremaster
The Eremites "have a claim to part of the legacy" of the ancient civilizations they come from, "as a deterrent of last resort in a crisis." They have passed down the knowledge of their ancestral civilization in oral form, though their stories are gradually disappearing or being distorted over the generations. Still, those among the Eremites who remember their history make sure to keep it alive. Their history also survives through their performing culture and combat style; for example, the combat skills of the Eremite Sword-Dancers were passed down since the days of Deshret's civilization and are now an art as well as a combat style,Eremite Sword-Dancer and the Eremites' dance traditions were passed down from their ancestors' worship rituals.Eremite Floral Ring-Dancer They can also be seen playing instruments, such as a tambourine and a lute-like stringed instrument.
As the Eremite mercenaries are very loosely organized, anyone can join them. Traditionally, only those hailing from the desert can join, but there have been a few exceptions, such as Rukh Shah.Sekkura Others simply use the name for their own benefit, causing unaware foreigners to hire them for a poor job, making the group as a whole looked down upon. One example is Kasim, who uses the name for his own benefit and is known as a fraud by the Corps of Thirty.
Nazafarin, a scholar from Sumeru, has a negative perception of them and describes them as "true soldiers of fortune who will do anything for money," and goes on to state that some of its members wield "formidable" elemental powers. These powers are not inherent to the Eremites themselves, but are rather borrowed from Spirit of Omen ancient desert spirits (or fragments thereof) which can manipulate the elements. These spirit fragments dwell within the Eremites' weapons and awaken during times of peril, to the boon of the Eremites wielding them.The Temple Where Sand Flows Like Tears However, it is suggested that once the spirits awaken, they can only be satisfied once blood has spilt, whether of the Eremites or the other side.Eremite Daythunder
The Eremites have an open partnership with the Adventurers' Guild,Wisdom Has Built Her House, She Has Hewn Out Her Seven Pillars and they conduct business all across Teyvat. For example, Younan often travels to Inazuma since his job involves facilitating international trade from Sumeru, while Irus' crew was commissioned by Jakob an individual in Fontaine. Sumida once commissioned a member of the Eremites to assist her in the quest for the Maushiro (A Particularly Particular Author) Maushiro, to no avail. The Eremites are also fond of Genius Invokation TCG, and many can be seen across Sumeru playing the game.
Factions
Corps of Thirty
Corps of Thirty
The Corps of Thirty are members of the Eremites who guard Sumeru City.Asfand They are based in the Citadel of Regzar, to the northeastern side of Sumeru City. Unlike most other Eremites, they wear green scarves instead of red ones. Their name comes from the fact that the group had thirty founders, and they are said to be one of the oldest Eremite groups in Sumeru.Rukh Shah
Dehya is a notable former member of the Corps of Thirty.
Aybak's group
Aybak is the leader of a group of Eremites in Caravan Ribat. This group is under contract with the Akademiya and is responsible for the security of Caravan Ribat, as well as maintenance of the Wall of Samiel. The group is very tight-knit and treats each other like family, calling each other brothers and sisters.Aybak
Rahman's faction
Rahman has his own Eremite faction located near Valley of Dahri. Similar to Ayn Al-Ahmar, he and his faction are also believers of King Deshret and initially despised Greater Lord Rukkhadevata and the forest folk. They even kidnapped the Village Keepers of Aaru Village, believing that it would help bring about King Deshret's resurrection.
However, after witnessing the truth about the great deed of the previous Dendro Archon, Rahman and his group abandoned their prejudice. Realizing their true enemy was the Akademiya, they aided the Traveler's group in freeing Lesser Lord Kusanali, and are currently working with Setaria and the reformed Akademiya to promote education among the Eremites and other desert peoples.
Blazing Beasts
The Blazing Beasts are a group of Eremites, of which Dehya is the most renowned member. Dehya joined the Blazing Beasts at a young age, after her last argument with Kusayla; Kusayla secretly arranged the faction to rescue Dehya and ensured that she would leave Dakan Al-Ahmar without harassment from Deshret's Relics.Annals of the Scarlet Sands
Farrokhzadan
Farrokhzadan
The Farrokhzadan are a tribe of Eremites related to Agha Farrokh. They are currently led by Siman Farrokhzad, Agha's daughter, and are assisting Il Dottore and the Fatui in their goal of capturing Aranara.
Thutmose
The Thutmose are a group of Eremites active in the desert, and are also devout believers of King Deshret. To be able to explore the secret of Al-Ahmar, Thutmose has sought knowledge and collaborators from many sources, from Sumeru researchers to the Fatui.

The Thutmose secret base is located on Lamb-Devourer Rock.
Tanit
Tanit
The Tanit were a nomadic Eremite tribe active in the desert led by their matriarch Babel. Their most recent campsite was at the southern border of the Desert of Hadramaveth, where they relied on the wenut trade with outsiders. They would eventually be annihilated by the Traveler and Jeht, after Babel's attempts to manipulate and get rid of them had failed.
Deshret's Relics
Deshret's Relics were formerly a large group of Eremites that blackmailed its members by making them leave behind "records" at their headquarters, which detailed something unpleasant about its members such as sins, unforgivable acts or immoral exploits, which they claimed was a sign of "loyalty." Following Kusayla's burning of the records, many left the group, leaving behind a few loyalists. The group was eventually dismantled by Dakan Al-Ahmar, Dehya and the Traveler, and its members taken into custody by the Corps of Thirty.Sincerity's Facade
Ayn Al-Ahmar
Ayn Al-Ahmar is a subgroup of Deshret's RelicsShade Upon Red Silk that are active in Port Ormos, led by Mizri. Like many Eremites, they are devout followers of King Deshret, and view Greater Lord Rukkhadevata poorly in comparison to him. They take their name after King Deshret's alleged true name, Al-Ahmar. They were in competition with other Eremite factions in Port Ormos to obtain a Divine Knowledge Capsule rumored to hold the power of King Deshret, and succeeded in obtaining it through an auction. However, Mizri went mad after using the knowledge capsule and briefly rampaged before being defeated by Alhaitham, who secretly took the Divine Knowledge Capsule from them afterwards.Ever So Close
Dakan Al-Ahmar
Dakan Al-Ahmar was a subgroup of Deshret's Relics led by Dehya's father Kusayla. After Kusayla's death, the group sought revenge on Deshret's Relics. They began conducting raids on not only members of the Relics, but on merchant caravans and innocent citizens as well, seeking to accumulate resources for their crusade against the Relics. After Deshret's Relics was destroyed and their revenge was fulfilled, Dakan Al-Ahmar's remaining members surrendered themselves to the Corps of Thirty for their crimes.
The Caracal Battalion
The Caracal Battalion is an Eremite faction active in Port Ormos. They were in competition with other factions such as Ayn Al-Ahmar to claim a Divine Knowledge Capsule rumored to hold the power of King Deshret. Tariq and Tumart of Ayn Al-Ahmar claim that, unlike them, the Caracal Battalion is "nothing but a bunch of money-grubbing opportunists out for a quick Mora."Lost in Prosperity
Afiyah
The Afiyah are a nomadic Eremite tribe in the Desert of Hadramaveth. Members of the tribe colluded with Aderfi of the Tanit to ambush the Traveler and take Liloupar.
Others
Two other known Eremite tribes are the Uzza and the Shimti, both of which are said to have matriarchs and venerate the Nabu Malikata Goddess of Flowers, much like the Tanit.A Moment Congealed
Other Eremite tribes and brigades operate on their own accord. They usually only receive commissions from individuals or families to act as bodyguards, and do not have a clear operating structure like other factions.

<title>Dvalin</title>
<text>the character the Weekly Boss Stormterror Dvalin
Dvalin, also known as Stormterror, is an Anemo elemental dragon and the original Dragon of the East of Mondstadt's Four Winds. He has been the Anemo Archon Barbatos' friend for almost 2000 years and is the longest-worshipped of the Four Winds.Breeze Amidst the Forest
However, during the cataclysm five hundred years ago, Dvalin was grievously injured in battle against the corrupted black dragon Durin, and settled in the ancient god Decarabian's abandoned tower to recuperate. Over the course of five hundred years, the Abyssal poison in Durin's veins that Dvalin ingested continued to torment him, while the people of Mondstadt forgot him. When he finally awoke, Dvalin believed himself abandoned by the Anemo Archon and Mondstadt. The Abyss Order took advantage of this to corrupt his mind even further, inciting him to attack Mondstadt and earning the dragon the name "Stormterror."That Green Fellow
Dvalin's sanity is eventually restored through the efforts of Barbatos' mortal form Venti, the Traveler, Paimon, Jean, and Diluc.Song of the Dragon and Freedom
Description
One of The Four Winds of Mondstadt: Dvalin, the Dragon of the East.With the passages of long years and amid boundless darkness, even the purest gem will become dulled by dust, and even the noble dragon might be corrupted and cankered by hatred.But never forget that dust can be wiped away, and the power of doubt and poison can be shattered.'"Fly freely in the sky."Just like you did in those days when we met, when I walked upon this land and sang the songs of the wind,"And you soared on high, looking down on the world from above."Today, the sky is no longer swept by wind and snow. The green grass grows all over the earth, and it is beautiful."If you could walk on the earth and listen to the songs of shepherds and the scattered sound of the wind chimes in the distance, if you could have tasted wine as sweet as honey, you could understand."How wonderful it would have been if you were as I, witnessing your noble, beautiful form as you soared through the blue sky."Then you would know that this sky and this earth are both things worth fighting for."'
Profile
Dvalin is an Anemo elemental dragon and the former Dragon of the East. For a millennium, he had defended Mondstadt with his own might. With full command over sky and wind, Dvalin is an immensely powerful being capable of destroying the venomous clouds of the Black Dragon Durin with his whirlwinds, of which not even the Thousand Winds could resist nor achieve.
Appearance
Dvalin has an enormous build and is so far one of the largest beings in Teyvat. His entire body is colored in a shade of blue, with his main body being a lighter Azure blue, while his talons and horns colored in more of a darker midnight blue. Dvalin also emits light from different areas of his body, notably his eyes that seem to have a blue flame effect, and the scales on his wings that emit an aqua glow. He possesses a total of six large wings on his body (three on each side) allows him to fly. Behind those wings is his massive tail, which resembles bird-like feathering. He possesses two horns on his head that resembles that of a goat, with a blue gradient that gradually fades to black. His front beak is incredibly sharp and possesses very sharp teeth, albeit a low amount. There are four sets of nails on each of the four talons, being very long and sharp with a gradient.
Before Dvalin is defeated by the Traveler, he possesses two purple sharp spikes on his back. These spikes are actually corrupted blood clots, remnants of Dvalin's battle against the black dragon Durin in Dragonspine long ago.
Story
History
Around two thousand years ago,It is unclear when exactly Dvalin and Barbatos met, but the poet in Breeze Amidst the Forest (implied to be Venti himself) says it occurred in '"ancient times, when the gods walked among us in their prime."' This puts their meeting somewhere between Barbatos' ascension 2600 years ago, and his departure from Mondstadt between 2000 and 1000 years ago. Dvalin was born from a convergence of elemental energy in the high heavens. This young dragon was very curious and descended to the continent of Teyvat to observe the world around him. As an enormous and powerful dragon, his presence frequently but unintentionally caused havoc and destruction around him, resulting in fearful or spiteful reactions from humans. Dvalin did not yet understand the consequences of his actions and was thus confused and hurt by the treatment he received.
One day, attracted by the music from the Holy Lyre der Himmel, he landed next to Barbatos, the Anemo Archon of The Seven and the deity of Mondstadt. Though the humans panicked, Barbatos remained calm and sang of the dragon's beauty. Seeing that the god wished for him to be understood as well, Dvalin decided to stay by his side and befriended him. He learned human speech and the Archon's singing techniques.
A thousand years ago, following Vennessa's rebellion against the Mondstadt Aristocracy, the Four Winds were established. Dvalin was Dragon of the East, Andrius the Wolf of the North, and Vennessa simultaneously the Lion of the South and the Falcon of the West.Character Teaser: Breeze Amidst the Forest
Approximately five hundred years ago, the land was engulfed by the cataclysm. Durin, a black serpentine dragon, rose from the abyss to cast its shadow over Mondstadt. The prayers of Mondstadt's people awoke the Anemo Archon, and his will summoned forth the Wind Dragon Dvalin. As Mondstadt's last line of defense, the two battled the wicked dragon to the death in raging storms. Dvalin ultimately prevailed, tearing open the throat of the wicked dragon at the cost of ingesting its poisonous blood. Dvalin protected Mondstadt with his life, and his only wish was to be understood by humans. He then fell into a slumber.Weapon Series: Skyward Series
Archon Quests
Some time before the Traveler's arrival in Mondstadt, Dvalin awoke and returned to Mondstadt, only to be greeted by fear and scorn from the humans of this era, who had forgotten about him and his identity as one of the Four Winds. Angry and hurt, both from the rejection and the lingering pain from the poisoned blood clots on his back, Dvalin was easily swayed by the Abyss Order into rescinding his title as Dragon of the EastA Long Shot q=Dvalin: Is this... the power of the Anemo Archon? But I am no longer part of the Four Winds. and attacking the city. This earned him the name Stormterror, and Decarabian's city - which he had taken up as his residence - came to be known as Stormterror's Lair. While key personnel in the Knights of Favonius eventually discovered that Stormterror was Dvalin of the Four Winds, they decided to keep it a secret from the populace as a result of pressure from the Fatui.
While making their way through Whispering Woods to get to the City of Mondstadt, Paimon and the Traveler encounter a boy talking to a dragon. Unbeknownst to them at the time, they were intruding on Venti's attempt to cure Dvalin's poisoning by creating a connection to him. The two attempt to hide away, but are detected and Dvalin flies off in a rage while Venti makes his escape shortly afterward,Forest Rendezvous having been poisoned himself when the connection failed.Let the Wind Lead (Quest)
After Amber takes the Traveler to the city and shows them how to use a Wind Glider, Dvalin suddenly attacks the city, creating massive tornadoes. The Traveler is sucked up by one, but instead of falling to their doom, they are kept aloft through a mysterious figure's power - which once again was Venti, using his power over the thousand winds. The Traveler fights Dvalin while aloft and succeeds in driving him away.Dragon Storm
Upon investigating the anomaly, it turns out the Abyss Order attempted to take the opportunity to manipulate Dvalin into a war entity. After the Abyss Order thwarts one attempt to restore Dvalin,Reunion With the Dragon the small group organized to save Dvalin tracks him down and confronts him at Decarabian's tower. They destroy the poisonous blood clots and he eventually realizes that Mondstadt had not intentionally rejected him. When their battleground collapses, Dvalin saves them from falling and converses with Venti before flying away. Jean reveals the truth behind the incident to the people of Mondstadt and clears up the misunderstanding.A Long Shot
Events
At the end of Invitation of Windblume, Venti, the Traveler, and Paimon travel to Decarabian's tower, where they witness Dvalin flying overhead to celebrate Windblume in his way.
During Midsummer Island Adventure, Venti summons Dvalin to fly the Traveler, Paimon, Jean, Barbara, and Klee to Golden Apple Archipelago 1.6 Golden Apple Archipelago. He later does the same to get Diluc, Kaeya, Albedo, and Razor to the island. Notably, Barbara identifies Dvalin as Dragon of the East, even though Dvalin presumably already renounced the title at this point in the story.
During one of the Windblume Festivals, Cyno, hearing of Mondstadt's dragon, went to his lair to take photos of him, finding the dragon majestic. He had Albedo create a Genius Invokation TCG card back based on Dvalin, Lazurite Swirl.

<title>Abyssal Corruption</title>
<text>Abyssal corruption is a generic term for entities which have fallen under the Abyss' influence. Such entities have a negative effect on the world of Teyvat.
Overview
The Abyss holds the power of the Void Realm, which is diametrically opposed to the powers of the Light Realm and the Human Realm, the latter of which the surface world of Teyvat belongs to. As a result, surges of the Abyss' power have catastrophic consequences for Teyvat and humanity. The cataclysm 500 years ago is currently the most notable surge of Abyssal power; it was caused by an attack by monsters of Khaenri'ah, which were created from the Abyss' powers.Breeze Amidst the ForestEnd of the Line (Quest)A Company Vanishing Into the Deep Following the aftermath of Khaenri'ah's destruction, some of the humans-turned-monsters became members of the Abyss Order, who are capable of spreading Abyssal corruption.
Prolonged contact with Abyssal corruption causes negative physical and mental consequences. Physical ailments include a worsening cough which will eventually result in coughing up blood and eventually, one's innards.Wherefore Did the Spiritstone Descend? Hallucinations, visions, and insanity have also resulted from contact with Abyssal corruption,Valor's Afterglow: Return by Sundown and prolonged exposure can drastically alter a person's personality by exacerbating their desires.
Purification
Abyssal corruption can be purified or controlled through various means. Destroying sources of Abyssal corruption, depending on the entities' strength, can either permanently or temporarily halt their effects. The Fatui developed the Mokosh Device, a machine capable of clearing Abyssal corruption up to a certain degree.Fatui Action Logs
The power of Celestia can repel Abyssal corruption, and holding a connection to the elements - whether through bearing a Vision or some other means - provides greater resistance against the effects of Abyssal corruption. Venti visits the Symbol of Mondstadt's Hero, which allegedly grew where Vennessa ascended to Celestia and holds the power of Anemo,Leaves on the Wind to recover from the Abyssal corruption which poisoned him when he attempted to break the curse over Dvalin.Let the Wind Lead (Quest) In The Chasm: Underground Mines The Chasm, the unearthing of a Chasm Nail fragment caused both the Abyssal Dark Mud and the mysterious Lumenstones and Lumenspar to begin growing en masse throughout the mines.Chasm Spelunkers The Lumenstone Adjuvant, a particularly large Lumenstone which can be further enhanced by Lumenstones and Lumenspar, is capable of clearing out Dark Mud.
For reasons yet to be explained, the Traveler was capable of purifying the Abyssal corruption in one of Dvalin's teardrops; by comparison, Lisa felt a rejection from the tear that took the form of a sharp stinging sensation.
Notable Occurrences
The following are notable forms of Abyssal corruption which the Traveler has faced or has otherwise learned about.
Tainted Blood
Monsters from Khaenri'ah, most of which were created by the alchemist "Gold" Rhinedottir, have blood tainted by the power of the Abyss. This otherworldly power can have lingering effects when spilled on Teyvat soil; after the demon dragon Durin was slain over Dragonspine, its blood seeped into the land and revitalized the Frostbearing Tree,Frostbearer as well as crystallized into Crimson Agate which can then be offered to the tree and allow it to grow. This growth defies the power of the Skyfrost Nail, which caused the land of Dragonspine to freeze over several thousand years ago and led to the collapse of the ancient civilization Sal Vindagnyr.Dragonspine's Glacial Secret
During his battle against Durin, Dvalin also ingested some of its blood after killing it with a fatal bite to its neck. The poisoned blood and the wounds he suffered over the course of the battle inflicted great suffering, which the Abyss Order took advantage of after his reawakening 500 years later to pit him against Barbatos. When Barbatos, in the form of Venti, initially attempted to purify Dvalin, the Traveler and Paimon unintentionally interrupted them, causing the attempt to fail and getting Venti himself poisoned in turn.
Defiled Statue
Defiled Statue
The Defiled Statue is a Statue of The Seven in Barbatos' image, which was somehow plundered from Mondstadt by the Abyss Order as part of a project known as the Loom of Fate. The Abyss Order intended on using the Defiled Statue, the power of the ancient god Osial, and the core of the Weird Statue First Field Tiller to create a weapon capable of destroying Celestia. Because of Dainsleif and the Traveler's intervention, this project is currently at a standstill, although the Defiled Statue's fate has been left unaddressed.A Soul Set Apart
Dark Mud
Dark Mud
The discovery of a fragment of the Chasm Nail resulted in a surge of Abyssal corruption, primarily in the form of Dark Mud. The power of the Abyss in The Chasm appears to be at "war" with the power of Celestia, which also surged after the discovery of the fragment; Khedive likens humanity as being "akin to beans on a stone mill, on the brink of a clash between two great powers. [...] we are presently being crushed by these two forces - one from above and one from below - and we shall soon be turned into bean paste!"
During the events of 'Homecoming', it is revealed that the Dark Mud is actually a form of forbidden knowledge that was converted into its current form by the Divine Nail present in the area, which would remain unaffected by changes to Irminsul.What Shape Does the Self Hold
Miasmic Tumor
The "Miasmic Tumor" was the accumulation of filth absorbed by the Sacred Sakura, which was created by Raiden Makoto and planted by Raiden Ei to dampen the effects of Khaenri'ah's attack during the cataclysm on Inazuma.Radiant Sakura
During the events of 'Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual', the Traveler helps the shrine maiden Hanachirusato - who was actually a resurgence of filth herself, formed from the memories of the deceased Kitsune Saiguu - perform a major cleansing on the Sacred Sakura's roots and purge the "Miasmic Tumor."

<title>Vassals of Watatsumi</title>
<text>The Vassals of Watatsumi were members of a reptile-like species originating from Enkanomiya.
Overview
According to ancient documents and oral legends of Watatsumi Island, the Vassals of Watatsumi were Orobashi's familiars.Three Realms Gateway Offering: The EveThree Realms Gateway Offering: Aftermath They were created with Orobashi's power, and when Orobashi perished, the Vassals of Watatsumi ceased being born. In ancient times the Vassals of Watatsumi had half-human and half-reptile forms. Sangonomiya Kokomi mentions that over time the forms of the Vassals of Watatsumi gradually became more identical to humans, to the point that the only trait distinguishing the Vassals of Watatsumi from normal humans was their snake-like pupils.
Various legends and books describe the powers of the Vassals of Watatsumi. The Vassals of Watatsumi defended the people of Enkanomiya from Bathysmal Vishaps. They were capable of communicating with both humans and vishaps. Furthermore, the Vassals of Watatsumi were said to have a deep connection to the Dainichi Mikoshi and could even make the Dainichi Mikoshi fulfill their desires. Theoretically, a Vassal of Watatsumi could even make the Dainichi Mikoshi destroy itself.
The events of Aphotic Diffusal strongly suggest that Tsumi is the very last Vassal of Watatsumi. She is mentioned to possess the tell-tale trait of the Vassals of Watatsumi, their snake-like pupils. In Three Realms Gateway Offering: Aftermath she speaks of how she could theoretically destroy the Dainichi Mikoshi. Furthermore, Kokomi mentions how in the past, the last known Vassal of Watatsumi and their guardian shrine maiden vanished after being attacked by the Bathysmal Vishaps. At the time, the Vassal was an infant girl. This Vassal also carried a piece of a special pendant, which had been split between the Vassals of Watatsumi, the Dainichi Mikoshi, and the Sangonomiya Clan. Tsumi states that she was raised by the Bathysmal Vishaps from a young age, and she also possesses a piece of this special pendant.
However, the above narrative has been challenged by Enjou and other texts. According to Enjou, ancient Enkanomiya legends have described the idea of vishap-people. According to these legends, after suffering defeat at the hands of a human, the highly intelligent and fast-adapting Bathysmal Vishaps began to evolve in order to survive. They began imitating the victors of their evolutionary battle, the humans. This evolution supposedly gave way to a new line of humanoid vishaps, the Reptilians. Enjou states that Reptilians are indistinguishable from humans, except for having vertical, snake-like pupils. Supposedly the Reptilians then gradually infiltrated Enkanomiya's society, taking over many high-ranking positions. Given these legends, Enjou believes that Tsumi may actually be one of these Reptilians. Furthermore, in ancient times, the people of Enkanomiya used to research Bathysmal Vishaps. Records remaining from this period imply that research suddenly ceased after they discovered budding evidence of the existence of vishap people.The Byakuyakoku Collection
Enjou's claim that vishap-people and Reptilians exist has been rebuked by Kokomi. According to Kokomi, these creatures are pure fiction. No records of their existence are present in the classified records of Sangonomiya.</text>

<title>Shenhe/Lore</title>
<text>quote = Even though she was born in the human world, she ended up being an adepti disciple. She grew up in the mountains far away from Liyue Harbor, her soul bound with red ropes, training both her body and mind.
Despite having the elegant temperament of an adeptus, she seems to be shrouded in mystery.
Personality
quote = An adepti disciple with a most unusual air about her. Having spent much time cultivating in isolation in Liyue's mountains, she has become every bit as cool and distant as the adepti themselves.
Originally part of the Tianheng Thaumaturges clan of exorcists, Shenhe originally had a happy life as a child until around the age of six, when her maddened father attempted to sacrifice her to a malevolent god in order to bring back his wife. While Shenhe managed to defeat the remnants of the god herself, the incident scarred her for life, giving her homicidal tendencies and causing her to believe herself to be a "cursed" child. Despite the adepti's attempts to contain her tendencies, they have only done so by binding her soul with Red Ropes, which suppress her emotions and cause her to have an indifferent personality.
Even with the red ropes suppressing her homicidal tendencies, Shenhe often contemplates the most violent means to eliminate others and is almost always easy to anger, obliterating her surroundings whenever her emotions get the best of her. She throws hostile looks at Xingqiu, believing him to be threatening others. Despite this, Shenhe ultimately wishes to fit in human society and places great trust in the Traveler.The Crane Returns on the Wind She prefers speaking with a small numbers of people at a time.
As a result of living with the adepti, many of her fellow people worship her as one of them, something which deeply troubles her despite stating that she is just an adepti's disciple. She enjoys sampling small quantities of foods in a manner similar to Albedo. Due to having a limited diet in the mountains, Shenhe is used to eating plenty of herbs despite clearly despising their taste.
Appearance
The World's Shackles
Shenhe uses the Tall Female Characters tall female model. She has a fair complexion, long hair that turns from silvery white at the roots to inky black at the ends, and pale, iridescent eyes with white pupils.
Official Introduction
Shenhe:The mortal realm briefly gracing, like a wisp of smoke vanishing
One has traversed many realms and taken a great many pupils. Among them, Shenhe breaks the closest resemblance to oneself. Were she not a mortal, one would like to have her stay by my side.
Shenhe comes from a branch family of a clan of exorcists. Due to certain reasons, Cloud Retainer took her in as a disciple.
To Shenhe, Cloud Retainer is a knowledgeable and chatty master.
To Cloud Retainer, Shenhe stands out as special from amongst the mortals she has instructed.
Living with adepti as a human is by no means an easy task, but Shenhe has a unique constitution, an immensely strong will, and a great talent for adepti arts, all of which have won her the acknowledgment of the adepti. However, the long years of cultivation, coupled with the habit of eating divine herbs and drinking the dew of the mountains, have made her more and more distant from earthly life, and she has even been regarded as a mysterious white-haired adeptus.
The occasional sharpness in her personality and the red ropes adorning her body add to her "mystery". If her past were to be written as a story, there would be multiple versions for sure.
Be it an immortal or a white-haired witch, how will people view this mysterious lady? Her secrets and feelings are as difficult to capture as the drifting clouds in the mountains.
Character Stories
Shenhe was originally from a branch family of exorcists, but due to a series of coincidences, she became the disciple of an adeptus.She is a student solely of Cloud Retainer in name, but her impressive constitution and intelligence quickly won several other adepti over.She would go on to learn from them all, eventually becoming a master of adeptal arts in her own right as a mortal.She very much looks the part as well in her unique temperament and manner of carrying herself - indeed, it would be no understatement to name her a true adeptus upon meeting her for the first time.However, it is precisely due to the long years of tutelage that she has lacked company save for the adepti and odd passing illuminated beast.This isolation has caused her to grow distant and indifferent.
Sometimes, a few rumors will escape from Liyue's small community of pilgrims to make the rounds in the city's back streets.These tales often depict someone being in a hopeless situation in some desperate place, when suddenly-A wandering white-haired adeptus comes to their rescue in the nick of time...Most such stories are a collection of lovely, intoxicating clichés, little different from the oft-told street-tales of fated marriages and the like.But if one were to ask that white-haired adeptus to tell the story, it would take a vastly different shape:"Some annoying creatures worm their way into the mountains from time to time. I simply get rid of them to prevent them from disturbing my master's meditations.""If some people did wind up getting caught in the crossfire and injured... Well, it was their decision to come here. There isn't much I can do about that."
Shenhe is in all likelihood the least accustomed to mortal life amongst those who take on an adeptal appearance.Having been sequestered in the mountains since a young age, she lacks experience and common sense, which makes it difficult for her to relate to people normally.To ordinary people, there are many solutions to any given problem. But to Shenhe, any solution that is not the simplest and most direct one may as well not exist.For example, she almost never considers "negotiation" as a solution to being at cross-purposes with others, mostly resorting to "threats" instead. After all, it is simple and efficacious. A good solution, no?She has also spent much time ruminating on problems that are truly esoteric.For example: Why do we need to pay for food?Is there any difference between intimidating civilians and intimidating bandits?She even truly believes that her master, Cloud Retainer, is a most brilliant and eloquent conversationalist.In a certain sense, she can be considered very pure.Much like a child, she relies on her chaotic yet straightforward intuition and logic to get her through life.Mountain Shaper once had this to say about her:"Little Shenhe is not only stronger than most - she also possesses a unique character.""She knows not the world, understands not common sense, distinguishes few cuisines, and acknowledges no hierarchies.""It may not be such an easy thing for Cloud Retainer to tutor her."
Liyue has no lack of folktales about meetings with the adepti, and many of these concern relative nobodies whom an adeptus took under their wing, thus elevating them greatly.However, the circumstances under which Shenhe's fate became tied to the adeptal abodes was no such glorious thing. If anything, it was an experience characterized by anguish.When she was five, her mother passed away, and her father, having loved his wife dearly, found that agony hard to bear.Over time, this agony turned into resentment, and this resentment birthed obsession, by which he was driven wandering throughout the land like a man gone mad.He left for close to a year, never stopping, never able to sleep soundly, ever searching for some technique that might bring his wife back.At last, when the year was almost out, he returned in joyous frenzy.Her father had brought with him a secret art known as "Fate Transference"-By making a ritual sacrifice to the seelie summoned by this art, a living person's body could be exchanged for a dead one's life.At that time, Shenhe was yet utterly unaware of the disaster that would befall. She was only an ordinary child, overjoyed at her long-absent father's return.He claimed that he had a surprise awaiting her in a cave in the mountains behind and that he would take her there immediately. She was ecstatic...But the scene that followed would be burned into her mind forever.Her father summoned that hideous, horrifying black "seelie" into that cave, its blood-red eyes craving her delectable life-force.Stupefied, Shenhe knew not from whence it had come, nor what it wanted from this place.Crises often paralyze people. One thought only, however, crept into the young Shenhe's mind.This creature wanted to eat her, but she did not want to die. She wanted to live!Gripping her mother's keepsake, an exorcism dagger, she faced that dark "seelie," trembling yet resolute...Several days later, Cloud Retainer an adeptus following the trail of great evil would investigate the cave, only to find the little girl collapsed inside - spent, famished, parched, her life hanging by a thread.Taking pity on the lass' ruinous fate, and seeing that she possessed great talent, having repelled some terrifying force on her own, the adeptus would bring her back, heal her, and instruct her in the adeptal path.If not for that, Shenhe would not be as she is today.
Even the most diffident heart, cooled from living and training in the mountains for over a decade, might sometimes experience strange surges.So it was with Shenhe. On impulse, she came down from the mountains one night to return to what was once her home.She did not know how she felt about her home or her family. She was merely driven by some nebulous desire:To live in the house that was once hers, and to see what became of her father, lost in his obsession.She learned from neighbors that he had passed away several years prior only when she got there.Her childhood home had also been demolished by pawnbrokers - and thus had all the traces of her memory dissipated.She did not care about the attention she was attracting, and did not answer a single one of the questions asked by those in the vicinity.She simply stood there, listening to the howls that swept through the depths of her heart.Was it hatred? Mania? Relief?They were all there, and yet none tarried for even an instant. It was as if her heart were an old well without ripples.No, like a barren well with no water upon which there might be ripples.She stood there for a long time, before departing again before the astonished eyes of all.Each step was slow indeed, but she never once turned back.
Liyue has its own fortune-telling, destiny-reading methods, similar to astrology.Of these, there are two fates that people seek to avoid at all costs.One is that of the "solitary star," which dictates that one will be separated from friends and family, living alone all one's days.The other is "disastrous evil," which means that one will face many hardships and perils.When the adepti rescued Shenhe, Moon Carver did once read her fortune.The signs showed that she was marked by both the "solitary star" and "disastrous evil," and that she was also plagued by intense homicidal urges - she was thus a person of supremely ominous destiny, doomed to harm both herself and others.To ensure that she could grow up safely and not harm any innocents, the adepti bound her soul using red ropes.This binding had the effect of restraining both her evil fate and her violent tendencies, but also shackled many emotions that should have originally belonged to a human.From then on, she became more and more disaffected by trivial matters, and even things most might consider important were but dust to her.She became ever less human, and ever more like a lovely yet cold statue.But surprisingly, she felt something stir within her when she encountered that Traveler from a distant land:Long-dormant emotions, now strangers to her, came loose all at once from the depths of fate's tableau.Perhaps it really was as Moon Carver once said: that heaven might dictate fates, but destiny's tale is written by mortals. The tale of Shenhe and the mortal world had not yet ended...
Once upon a time, Shenhe had a full head of black hair.When she was first brought to Mt. Hulao, she would not say a word. The only thing she proved willing to do was to climb the mountain and watch the sea of clouds.It was well, however, that she would sleep when tired, drink the dew of the mountains when thirsty, and would chew on a few stalks of Qingxin when hungry.Cloud Retainer took this all in, but did not disturb the girl, instead making this comb of white jade from a sacred stone and giving it to her.The adeptus said that if she ever wished to sever her ties with the mortal world and enter adeptal tutelage, she should brush her hair thrice with this comb, and it would be counted as a rite of apprenticeship.Shenhe did exactly as the adeptus said without any hesitation. And something strange happened then - for as the jade comb brushed through Shenhe's hair once, a layer of her black locks turned a frosty silver from root to tip.On the second brush, but half her hair remained dark.When the process was complete, only a flowing curtain of snow remained....Today, Shenhe still keeps this comb on her person as a symbol of her connection to the adepti.Through her years of training, she has long since come to understand the meaning behind those three brush strokes:The first to uproot useless anxiety, the second to forsake joy and sorrow, and the third to walk this path into old age without regret.
Few people know how the young girl in the cave, intended as a sacrifice by her own father, had been able to stand against the monster for days and nights on end by herself.Though Shenhe was born into an exorcist family, her maddened father had not taught her a single thing about exorcism.And like many at that innocent age, she was also wholly unused to facing life's perils alone.But in that aphotic cave, bereft of parental protection - indeed, betrayed by kin - Shenhe underwent a metamorphosis.Just as Moon Carver's readings had shown, the sleeping calamitous fates, violent urges, and unyielding spirit within her burst their bonds all at once.Those things served as an unseen shield and invisible blade, arming the girl's frail form.They gave her strength, gave her claws and fangs, allowing her to attack that wretched creature before her, to swear to tear it to shreds - to prove that she, and not it, was the cruelest evil that stalked the darkness.Their life-and-death battle across the next few days was one without end. Hunter and hunted switched places many times, the conflict locked in stalemate...As the shadow of death loomed large, the gods looked upon the extraordinary girl with favor.With the bright, crystalline object falling into Shenhe's hands, the balance tipped irrevocably in her favor and the victor was decided.The vivid icy light pierced through the dark like skyglow, showing the path to the future.In the past, it had guided Shenhe from her miserable fate. In the future, it would also lead her back to the mortal realm.

<title>Sumeru/History</title>
<text>Timeline
A timeline of historical events in the Sumeru region. Due to a lack of relative dates, most of Sumeru's pre-cataclysm lore cannot be verifiably categorized and have been placed in the earliest reasonable timeframe.
section=1 Timeline TimelineNote
The Old World
Timeline The Old World
* The Dendro Dragon, Apep, presumably ruled Sumeru as a member of the Seven Sovereigns.
The New World
Timeline The New World
* A member of the original Seelie race, heavily implied to be the Goddess of Flowers, survives the downfall of the Seelie race.
Pre-Archon War
'Note: It is unclear when the civilization of the three God-Kings, its destruction, and the span of various human city-states existed beyond "thousands of years ago," so they have been tentatively placed under the Pre-Archon War Era.'
* As the avatar of Irminsul, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata presumably came into existence at some point in time long in the past.Given that Sal Vindagnyr, a Divine Envoy era civilization, fell after its ancient white tree (presumably similar to, or a branch of, Irminsul) was destroyed by the Skyfrost Nail, it can be assumed that Irminsul also existed during that era. However, this does not indicate when exactly Rukkhadevata came into existence.
* According to legend, King Deshret was a "son of the sky," but he was born after the fall of the Seelie and the Moon Sisters and only learned of their stories from an unspecified woman (likely either the Goddess of Flowers or Greater Lord Rukkhadevata).The narrative in 'The Lay of Al-Ahmar' suggests that he once lived in Celestia. However, this is not corroborated by the narrative of 'The Shepherd and the Magic Bottle' (which states that he learned the story of the Moon Sisters from the Jinn) or the description of Staff of the Scarlet Sands (which is narrated from Deshret's point of view and says that "she" - either the Goddess of Flowers or Greater Lord Rukkhadevata - told him the story instead).
The Archon War (?–2000 years ago)
Timeline The Archon War (?–2000 years ago)
* The Goddess of Flowers, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, and King Deshret befriend each other and become known as the God-Kings of Sumeru.
* At some point in time, the goddess of flowers foresaw the coming of the cataclysm. She creates a shard of Khvarena and leaves it in the care of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.
* Rukkhadevata would turn the shard into the divine bird Simurgh. She charged Simurgh with "the guardianship of the border between new birth and death".
Ay-Khanoum
* The Goddess of Flowers, King Deshret, and Greater Lord Rukkhadevata - collectively known as the three God-Kings of Sumeru - build Ay-Khanoum, the "City of Amphitheaters." Its name means "City of the Moon Maiden" in the ancient language of the Jinn.
** The Goddess of Flowers is said to have an "amicable relationship" with the Jinn.
** According to some legends, King Deshret captured the Jinn in magic bottles marked by his seal, although the Jinn were also his willing servants in his cause of conquering the world. He created Ay-Khanoum as a city for the Jinn, while they created the entrance to the Mausoleum of King Deshret.Because 'The Shepherd and the Magic Bottle' is a story of unknown and unverifiable origin and excludes any mention of the Goddess of Flowers, it is highly likely that some of its contents are inaccurate. The wiki currently assumes that Oasis Garden's Mourning's description is more accurate in its depiction of Ay-Khanoum's history.
* The Goddess of Flowers dies "due to the malice of the burning sun and yellow sand" and the city of Ay-Khanoum is destroyed.
** The Goddess of Flowers desired a "spectacular death" so that the bitterness of her death would preserve her legacy forever. King Deshret, who was enamored with her, never realized this, sending him into an obsessive spiral over the shared vision the three God-Kings once had.
** The "promised land of 'Valivija'" is buried by the desert sands, which may correspond with Ay-Khanoum.
** Following the fall of Ay-Khanoum and the death of the Goddess of Flowers, King Deshret and Greater Lord Rukkhadevata parted ways to create their own civilizations.
Dharma Forest
'Note: Events in this section are currently assumed to be concurrent with King Deshret's Civilization and Gurabad.'
* After separating from King Deshret, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata comes to the East of the Great Red Sand and creates the Varuna Contraption that terraforms part of desert into a rainforest.The Chinese description for The Coordinates of Sun and Rain details: 依照传说，司草木的女神在沙漠的一角唤出能召来甘霖的精灵，名之曰「法留纳」亦即「水天」。 tl=According to legend, the goddess who controlled plants summoned, in a part of the desert, a spirit of sweet rains, whose name was Varuna, or "Water-Sky."
** At the border between the forest and the desert, the Wall of Samiel was erected to prevent the forest from undergoing desertification.
** After the forest labyrinth was created, the lord of the forest Viaghara was born from the moon's reflection on the water, resembling a tiger in shape.
* With the help of her followers, who would go on to establish the Amurta Darshan of Sumeru Akademiya, Rukkhadevata developed a flourishing rainforest. Sumeru City was built on the Divine Tree, a particularly massive tree located in Sumeru's forest region, and the sages of Sumeru Akademiya assisted Rukkhadevata in managing the nation's affairs.
* Rukkhadevata also created the Aranara, small plantlike creatures with the ability to control dreams.
* Thousands of years ago ― Rukkhadevata briefly returns to the desert to help rescue King Deshret's people from the effects of forbidden knowledge, and creates the Akasha System to help combat it by uniting the people's wisdom. However, the endeavor exhausts much of her strength and shrinks her into the stature of a child.
King Deshret's Civilization
* While Rukkhadevata creates a rainforest in a corner of the desert, Deshret continues ruling over the Great Red Sand.
* Thousands of years ago ― King Deshret eventually succumbs to the "poison" of forbidden knowledge.The Lay of Al-Ahmar suggests that King Deshret heeds the three retainers, builds a great maze for hundreds years, and the kingdom collapses after one night. Since the description of the book states that the information is questionable, the information from the Archon Quest takes advantage.
** The forbidden knowledge brings calamities upon Sumeru. "People's minds were filled with crazed whispers, Eleazar dark gray scales spread across their bodies, The Withering even the land was stripped of its vigor."
** King Deshret asks Greater Lord Rukkhadevata for help, for the sake of their mutual friend. The Lord of Verdure gathered the priests, instructing them to build temples and creating Aaru Village as the last bastion of Deshret's civilization. She also expended a great deal of her power to suppress forbidden knowledge and regressed into a childlike form. Even this, however, was not enough; in the end, Deshret sacrificed himself to finally put an end to it.
* King Deshret's civilization fell and splintered into many smaller, human-led city-states.
Gurabad
* The vassal city-state of Gurabad rises after the death of the Goddess of Flowers, during what is known as the vassal states era.According to 'The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin', Gurabad was part of a vassal states era which drew to an end after King Deshret and the Sage-King of the Greenwood (presumably Greater Lord Rukkhadevata) regathered their subjects and recreated their oasis paradise. There is currently insufficient information to confirm or deny its account of the timeline, although there has been no indication of a second Deshret-Rukkhadevata civilization.
** The story of Gurabad is first known with the vassal king Ormazd Shah. Ormazd has 300 kins, one of them is Shirin of Gurabad Shirin, the half-fairy daughter of him and the fairy foremother Liloufar. Liloufar's three prophecies and three admonitions later become the ultimate destruction of Gurabad.
*** Ormazd adopts Parvezravan Kisra, and give him the surname "Parvez" for his enormous campaign.
*** Kisra Parvez and Shirin are married, though their marriage is not a happy one.
*** Shirin and Kisra murder Ormazd and his 300 heirs, and Kisra takes the title of the vassal king. He adds the name "ravan" to his bestowed surname, and now his name is Kisra Parvezravan.
*** The son of Parvezravan and Shirin is born, and is named Shiruyeh. Fearing Liloufar's admonitions, Parvezravan banishes his son, forces him to cover his face, and forbids him to set foot into Gurabad.
*** Shirin disguises herself as a divine princess of the temple to the moon goddess, and gives Shiruyeh false divination to confront Parvezravan. After that, Shiruyeh assassinates his father, claims the throne, and is forgiven by his mother.
*** The reign of Shiruyeh does not last long, as he is forever tormented by inescapable nightmares, until one day he fell into a great black chasm during one such frenzy. After that, a great plague emerged from that chasm, and Gurabad, without its king, collapses due to the calamity and the sand.
*** The fate of Shirin is questionable: some people say that she was subdued by King Deshret, while others say that she is still searching for her son until today.
City-States Era
* Thousands of years ago, after the extermination of forbidden knowledge ― Somehow, a man known as Shah Ramshahr comes to be credited with building the seven towers that were built during the eradication of forbidden knowledge. The towers, which are only known to have been built at the time of King Deshret's death, come to be known as the "Towers of Betrayal."
** According to inscriptions in the desert, seven cities were built around the seven towers, among which included Ay-Khanoum (which was apparently rebuilt after its initial destruction), Gurabad (a rebuilt version), Saleh, and Tulaytullah.

He eventually comes across a caravan stuck in quicksand and dies saving them, with his family learning of his death soon after.
** Kaveh reached schooling age and enrolled into the Kshahrewar after passing the entrance exams.Kaveh’s second Character Story explains that he reached schooling age and enrolled into the Akademiya around the time his father died.

<title>The Shogun</title>
<text>the puppet created by Ei the playable character Raiden Shogun  Raiden Shogun (Disambiguation)
The Shogun is an artificial body made by Ei to act as her current vessel. She is playable as the body of the Raiden Shogun.
Profile
The Shogun is the second puppet to be made after Ei wanted to create a body which could resist erosion. Her first attempt was Scaramouche, which she deemed a failure because he shed tears upon creation, which made her to believe that he was too fragile for the task. Like him, the Shogun has a consciousness of her own.Farewell to the Past Ei: Though she is a puppet, the Shogun has her own consciousness, too. When necessary, she appears here to confront me. She is connected to the storms of Inazuma,The Lonesome Euthymia and wields the Musou Isshin sword (Musou Isshin) that houses Ei in battle. The Shogun was created with a set list of rules that cannot be altered or shut off. According to Ei, she does not see the Shogun as an entity separate from herself, claiming that the Shogun counts as a different form of her existence and that she never intended to leave Inazuma in the hands of anybody but herself.The Fabric of Constancy
Prior to the Traveler's arrival to Inazuma, the Shogun was manipulated by the Fatui into issuing the Vision Hunt Decree, who had been assisted by the Kujou Clan Kujou and Hiiragi Clan after they had been promised power by them. When Kazuha's Friend attempted to challenge her over it with a duel before the throne, the Shogun had Kujou Sara duel him, who won, and per the rules, she executed him with the Musou no Hitotachi.
During the Inazuma Archon Quest series, the Shogun is first seen attempting to confiscate Thoma's Vision after having him captured despite his ties to the Kamisato Clan, one of the three clans forming the Tri-Commission. The Traveler, attempting to intervene, instead gets dragged into the Plane of Euthymia, where Ei defeats and ejects them. The Shogun then tries to execute the Traveler, but the distraction was long enough that Thoma was able to break free from his bindings and threw a spear at her, forcing her to abort as they escaped. She then issued for the Traveler's capture.
After learning the extent of the Fatui manipulation in Inazuma, Kujou Sara attempted to inform the Shogun, but was instead knocked out by La Signora when she arrived. The Shogun chastised her for punishing one of her subjects, decreeing that only she could do so. The Traveler then informed her of the Fatui's plot, though when she did not appear to be convinced, instead issued a duel before the throne. Signora, overconfident in her powers, was defeated by the Traveler and per the rules of the duel, the Shogun moved in to execute her with the Musou no Hitotachi. The Shogun then allowed them to leave the castle grounds alive; upon stepping outside the castle, she emerged to attack them, but Kazuha, who had arrived with the rest of the resistance, managed to parry the attack with his and his friend's Vision. Before the Shogun could attempt to attack the resistance, the Traveler attacked her first, causing them to be brought back to the Plane of Euthymia, where they defeated Ei, who agreed to change her views and attempted to do so to the Shogun.
The Shogun, having been designed to resist change, instead believed that Ei was succumbing to erosion and tried to stop her by refusing to comply with her orders as riftwolves were emerging in Inazuma. Ei, realizing the Shogun was responsible for stopping the body from moving, challenges her inside Makoto's consciousness to prove that she has not been corrupted. As a result of Istaroth temporal disruption and the Shogun's will, the two dueled for five centuries straight. Ei's new perspectives allowed her to defeat the Shogun, who conceded. She then asked it to serve as her kagemusha, which it accepted.Transient Dreams

<title>Lyris</title>
<text>Need clarification about the story
Lyris was an Oceanid who lived around 500 years ago and served as the Director of the Narzissenkreuz Institute, an orphanage in Fontaine.Riddles Awaiting Answers At some point, she became a member of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, where she gained the title of the "Red Empress." In the Ann of the Narzissenkreuz she is referred to as "Princess Lyris," based on a fairy tale told to her by Mary-Ann Guillotin, one of the children cared for by her at the Narzissenkreuz Institute.
Profile
Lyris was a gentle-natured Oceanid whose position of orphanage director was established in honor of the previous Hydro Archon, Egeria. In the Court of Fontaine's official register of Oceanids, she was noted to be highly affectionate and caring towards the children of the orphanage, but she was also said to be unintelligent compared to other Oceanids, having trouble understanding cause and effect and not knowing how to count.Search in the Algae Sea (Quest)
Appearance
When Mary-Ann Guillotin first arrived at the Narzissenkreuz Institute, the first person she met was Lyris, who was described by her to be "tall" and "pure".Heroes' Tea Party
Story
Not much is known about Lyris' backstory before she became the Narzissenkreuz Institute's director. In this role, she took in and cared for the children there, often playing games with them. She regarded the Vice-Director, Basil Elton, as her assistant.Odyssean Flower However, Basil was the actual manager of the orphanage's affairs.
When the cataclysm came 500 years prior to the game's events, Lyris and her fellow Lochfolk Oceanids disappeared, and most never returned to Fontaine. During this period, Basil was killed at sea during her battle against the beast Elynas (NPC) Elynas, while the Institute's location was destroyed in the calamity and the organization itself was disbanded in the aftermath. Afterwards, Rene and Jakob, two children who were formerly cared for by the Institute, established a secret society known as the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, with the goal of creating a gestalt consciousness to absorb the personalities of everyone in Fontaine and thus save them from Prophecy of Fontaine prophesied doom.
Unlike many other Oceanids, Lyris returned to Fontaine; she was saddened by the loss of the Narzissenkreuz Institute and the destruction caused by the cataclysm and no longer saw a way forwards. She longed to return to the past when she played happily with the Institute's children, and spent her time encircling the underwater ruins of the orphanage. It was there that she was approached by Rene and Jakob, who convinced Lyris (despite her reservations) to join the Narzissenkreuz Ordo.
Lyris either did not immediately leave with them, or she returned to the ruins of the Institute again at some later time; she was later visited there by Mary-Ann Guillotin and her robotic companion Seymour, who had dove to the ruins. Seeing Lyris depressed, Mary-Ann tried to cheer her up by telling her a fairy tale (based on the story of the "hero Narzissenkreuz" which Alain had made them play at the Institute as children).Rowboat's Wake (Quest) In this story, Lyris played the role of Princess Lyris, who sacrificed her "time" to save her friends and was reduced to endless slumber, but made a promise that her friends would carry her "future" for her and one day be able to reunite with her. This was an allegory to convince Lyris that the future was not as hopeless as she believed, as her friends were working to rebuild Fontaine, even making reference to Lyris' work with "Ney" (Rene) and "Jak" (Jakob). However, Lyris became interested in the story itself (namely the fate of the princess), so Mary-Ann came up with the start for a new chapter and suggested that Lyris create the ending for herself, before she returned to the surface.Interactable: Annapausis Interactables A Story
The Ordo
Eventually, Rene and Jakob brought Lyris with them to the Tower of Ipsissimus. In the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, Lyris was given the title of "Red Empress." Her participation was a great benefit for the Ordo; as Rene noted, apart from "inferior mutants," the "original [Oceanids]" could no longer be found in Fontaine. Lyris was given the job of dissolving the egos of the Ordo's members in order to help create the gestalt consciousness. However, Rene noted that even Lyris' condition was deteriorating, meaning urgency was needed for the Ordo's project. In time, Rene opted to become the first subject of his experiment and was absorbed into the gestalt, being reborn as Narzissenkreuz.Enigmatic Page (IX) Narzissenkreuz went on to absorb numerous other personalities, presumably with Lyris' aid.
Soon, it became clear that the Court of Fontaine did not tolerate Narzissenkreuz's existence. The Marechaussee Phantom Marechaussee Hunters, led by Alain and Mary-Ann Guillotin, were sent to hunt down Narzissenkreuz and destroy the Ordo; Lyris was also branded a criminal with a high-priority arrest warrant. To buy time for the project, Narzissenkreuz sent Jakob, Lyris, and many other members of the Ordo on a mission to Elynas, effectively using them as bait.Enigmatic Page (XI)Enigmatic Page (XIII) There, they fought with the Marechaussee Hunters, during which Lyris ended up absorbing the personality of Mary-Ann for unknown reasons, after which Mary-Ann was listed as missing in action.
The merged consciousness of Lyris and Mary-Ann Guillotin became the Oceanid "Mary-Ann." "Mary-Ann" constructed the dream world of the Annapausis, hiding herself within the fairy tale that the human Mary-Ann had told Lyris, to avoid confronting the harsh reality of all that had happened and wait for everyone else from the Institute to return. As a result of this dream, "Mary-Ann" accidentally created the Oceanid Ann, who possesses the memories of both the real Mary-Ann and Lyris, while acting in the role of the hero that Mary-Ann Guillotin dreamed herself to be in the fairy tale.Unfinished Story
"Mary-Ann" herself is not certain whether she should be considered as Lyris or as Mary-Ann Guillotin. Narzissenkreuz refers to her more as Lyris, saying she "just holds onto Mary-Ann, who herself still clings to life."Waking from the Great Dream (Quest)
Trivia
*It is likely that Lyris and the other Oceanids' disappearance during the cataclysm was because they went to the Girdle of the Sands in search of Egeria. The Oceanids scattered themselves upon learning that Egeria's remains had become what is now the Amrita Pool.Pale Fire

<title>Shirin of Gurabad</title>
<text>the historical figure the NPC Shirin
Shirin was a historical figure in the Great Red Sand, Sumeru and the last queen of Gurabad before its destruction. She was the half-Jinni daughter of Liloupar and Ormazd, the wife of Parvezravan, and the mother of Shiruyeh. Because of her role in driving Shiruyeh's actions, which led to Gurabad's destruction, both Shirin and her son have become villainous figures in tales related to the desert's history.
Profile
She was the half-Jinni daughter between the mortal hero Ormazd and the Jinni Liloupar, and later became the wife of Ormzad's adoptive son Parvezravan (Kisra Parvez). However, Liloupar's prophecies regarding Gurabad's fate and the loveless relationship between Shirin and Parvezravan eventually led her to plot his demise and with it, Gurabad's destruction, through their son Shiruyeh.
'The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin' is a novel of unverifiable accuracy based on the lives of Parvezravan, Shirin, and Shiruyeh.
Story
The shepherd Ormazd gained Liloupar's favor and with her assistance, united many desert city-states under Gurabad's control. However, he became an ordinary tyrant instead of the enlightened ruler which she hoped to become, and so Liloupar plotted to impose him with three generations of ruination.The First Days of the City of KingsLegacy of the Desert High-Born
She gave him a daughter, Shirin, along with three prophecies and three admonitions. The prophecies were that: First, she would fall in love with a hero and their child would surpass their father; second, that Shirin's relatives would meet a "sweet end;" and third, only Shirin would be given possession of Gurabad. Liloupar's admonitions for Ormazd were that: First, Shirin's joy would "bring tears to her father's eyes;" second, they "should no longer feast at the same table as their daughter after she was wed;" and third, Shirin's child would be "an ill omen upon the king's land."The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin
Shirin went on to marry Kisra Parvez, Ormazd's adoptive son, as a reward for his accomplishments in Gurabad's glory. At some point, Kisra also came to learn of Liloupar's prophecies and admonitions. Much to Shirin's dismay, Kisra held no genuine love for her and simply used her as a means of gaining the throne. Embittered with her life, Shirin plotted revenge. In accordance with the admonitions he received, Ormazd forbade Shirin from attending banquets; she took advantage of this fact to have slaves serve him and all her siblings poisoned honey, killing them all at a grand banquet. With this, Kisra became king of Gurabad and took the name Parvezravan.
Shirin bore Parvezravan a son, Shiruyeh; while Shirin doted on him, the king was wary of his son due to Liloupar's prophecy. Once he reached adulthood, Parvezravan banished Shiruyeh from Gurabad, and Shiruyeh was forced to hide his face behind a brass mask. Shirin took advantage of this to secretly meet with her son while disguised as a divine priestess, giving him a false prophecy to encourage him to kill his father and claim the throne for himself.
Eventually, Shiruyeh returned to Gurabad and stabbed his father to death. However, he came to have remorse for his actions and despite receiving his mother's forgiveness, was plagued by nightmares. One night, while wandering the desert in a bout of insomnia, Shiruyeh fell into a deep chasm and disappeared. Soon afterwards, a plague arose from the chasm which killed half of Gurabad's population and led to its abandonment, which later became known as "Shiruyeh's Plague." It is believed that both Shirin and Shiruyeh became evil apparitions, with Shirin either imprisoned in a magic silver bottle by King Deshret later on, or continuing to wander the desert to this day.</text>

<title>Inazuma/Culture</title>
<text>The Inazuma archipelago is sub-divided into three main factions: the islands ruled by the Raiden Shogun (Narukami Island, Kannazuka, Yashiori Island, and Seirai Island), Watatsumi Island which worships Orobashi, and Tsurumi Island.
While these islands are all considered part of Inazuma, the geographical and cultural makeup of these areas are vastly different.
Life in Inazuma
Life in Inazuma prior to the Ei's Vision Hunt Decree Vision Hunt and Sakoku Decree is unknown, but Paimon states that Inazuma did not have any problems the year before she began accompanying the Traveler.The Fond Farewell After Ei issued her decrees, life in the region took a drastic turn for the worse for all, as available resources in the nation dropped and very few goods were imported in, forcing many businesses to look for alternate methods. The atmosphere in the nation when the two decrees were active was implied to be tense and dangerous,Atsuko with some smugglers even refusing to bring in items from the nation.Bibo Crime is particularly rampant in Inazuma's wilderness, with large numbers of Treasure Hoarders and ronin like Nobushi and Kairagi.
Following the abolishment of the Vision Hunt Decree and expulsion of corrupt officials, life began to slowly improve for the better, although the Sakoku Decree meant that the economy was still struggling. After Ei abolished the Sakoku Decree, life took a turn for the better as the nation is finally able to conduct general trade and an outpouring of foreign visitors.
Inazuma only has one major city and one port; Inazuma City and Ritou respectively. Apart from these urban settings, the rest of the people live in small villages or estates. Some of these villages were abandoned; Seirai Island has no permanent human residents after the island was destroyed by the Thunder Manifestation, while Higi Village and another unnamed village south of it was evacuated after the release of Tatarigami energy on the island. Tsurumi Island, while part of the Inazuma archipelago, is also devoid of people, as its Thunderbird Civilization previous civilization was annihilated by Kapatcir.
Bake-Danukis are known to live in Inazuma, who enjoy pranking passersby by pretending to offer food and shelter, disguising it as leaves and mud. While humans are still the most predominant inhabitants of Inazuma, youkai such as tengu, oni and kitsune also reside in Inazuma; however, like the adepti of Liyue, few remain and most live in seclusion.
Inazuman samurai society often revolves around an honor system of sorts; samurai families, being relatively common in Inazuma, have an immense amount of pride and honor, often sending their children to serve in the Shogun's armies to glory and fame. Samurai are known to engage in duels from time to time. They are particularly prideful of their own skills; being bested in battle or duel by another or being helped by an outsider is typically considered to be shameful.Dreams of Sword Art
Agriculture
Watatsumi Island has historically had very poor soil for growing crops, which was a primary motivating factor for the Narukami-Watatsumi War at the end of the Archon War. According to legend, Enkanomiya is constantly trying to pull the spirit of Watatsumi Island into the depths, causing soil erosion and bleaching that turns it into "Holy Soil." The Watatsumi Mitama Omatsuri is a ritual performed to stave off the spread of Holy Soil. Tsuyuko, a shrine maiden who studied at Sumeru Akademiya, believes that "Holy Soil" is actually caused by the salinity and alkalinity of the seawater encroaching on the island, which leaches nutrients from the soil.The Moon-Bathed Deep (Quest)
Other islands appear to be having a similar issue, as Konda Village of Narukami Island has difficulty in trying to grow crops.
Many Lavender Melon trees can be found across Inazuma's islands. While Sunsettia and Apple trees cannot be found in Inazuma's overworld, this seems to be a purely gameplay phenomenon: the Expedition reward for Byakko Plain includes Sunsettias, which indicates that Sunsettias can be found in Inazuma's wilds.
Architecture
Inazuman buildings and furnishings typically make use of Aralia Wood Aralia, Maple Wood Maple, Otogi Wood Otogi or Yumemiru Wood. Yumemiru wood is typically used for creating shrines.
Cuisine
Category:Inazuma Dishes
According to Chongyun, authentic Inazuman cuisine is ice-cold fresh and can take the exhaustion away from a day of hard training. Seafood plays an important role in Inazuman cuisine, such as sushi and tempura. Other foods include poultry like Imported Poultry, ramen, dango, and egg rolls.
Technology
The Maguu Kenki originate from Inazuma. They are magical autonomous puppets that use the powers of Cryo and Anemo, having been created by unknown people to mimic the Iwakura Clan sword arts.
Onmyoudou was also developed in Inazuma by Kamuna Harunosuke. While mostly forgotten, traces of it still exist in legends and by the Kairagi, who utilise shikifuda to elementally infuse their swords despite not having a Vision.
Duels
A Duel Before the Throne is a traditional Inazuman duel between two combatants that is fought in Tenshukaku and witnessed by the Shogun.
If someone has a disagreement with another party or feels that they have been slighted in some way, they can challenge the offender to a duel before the throne. The two parties will travel to Tenshukaku and present their case to the Raiden Shogun. If the Shogun gives them the clearance to engage in combat, then they will begin fighting until someone is unable to duel any further. These duels always end in the death of one of the combatants. The loser is either killed by a lethal blow, or if they survive the duel, executed by the Musou no Hitotachi.
Two notable duels have been referenced so far. Kazuha's friend challenged the Raiden Shogun to a duel for instituting the Vision Hunt Decree, and Kujou Sara accepted on her behalf. He ultimately lost the duel and was executed. Later, during Duel Before the Throne in the Omnipresence Over Mortals Archon Quest, the Traveler challenged Signora to a duel in an attempt to stop the Fatui from taking over Inazuma and also as an act of revenge for her stealing Venti's Gnosis. A hard battle was fought, and ultimately, Signora was defeated and executed by the Musou no Hitotachi.
Arts
Ikebana
Ikebana is the art of arranging flowers to create a floral courtyard. Current known practitioners are Kamisato Ayaka and Fushizome.
Martial Arts
Martial Arts in Teyvat Inazuma
There are several martial arts practiced in Inazuma.
Mystic Arts
Mystic Arts in Teyvat Inazuma
Bladesmithing
Inazuma is famous for its bladesmithing techniques. It's fame even allowed them to have a consistent trade with Fontaine to provide the nation their skills. Inazuma had five bladesmithing schools called the Raiden Gokaden, though The Balladeer Scaramouche's machinations have resulted in only one school, the Amenoma School surviving.
Designs, Motifs, and Symbols
Symbols in Teyvat
The following designs, motifs, and symbols are typically seen within Inazuma or on Inazuma-related parties.
Character Cards
Inazuma's Character Cards are similar to Mondstadt Culture Character Cards Mondstadt's: it features one large circle with a smaller circle inside, aligned towards the bottom of the larger circle. Inazuma's Vision shape takes up the top center of the space between the two circles, with five smaller circles on each side.
The bottom three circles' icons are largely the same: the bottommost depicts a sakura or cherry blossom, while the one above it depicts two different kumadori makeup styles used in Kabuki theater. Above that are two opposing animal envoys wearing their corresponding masks: A kitsune wearing a fox mask on the right side and an inugami wearing a dog mask on the left.
Of the remaining four circles, the bottom left one depicts coral and crashing waves, which is possible a reference to Orobashi. Above it is a Shinto shrine with a cherry blossom symbol above it. To the right of the Vision is an icon depicting the Tenshukaku, and below it is an icon of a Tomoe mitsudomoe with a katana.
Electro Mitsudome
The Electro Mitsudome is the symbol that represents the Raiden Shogun and her rule. The Electro symbol is made from the negative space of the three tomoe.
Sakura Flower
Five-petaled flowers representing the Sacred Sakura can be found on the buildings of the Grand Narukami Shrine and on Yae Miko's clothing.
Mon
In Inazuma, like in Japanese history, clans may have a Mon (emblem) mon (紋) or seal by which they are identified.
Cloud Motif
A traditional way of drawing flat, stylised clouds called yokogumo (横雲).
Economy
Book printing appears to be one of the main trades in Inazuma, in part due to the Yae Publishing House, who are known throughout Teyvat as the giant in the printing industry. They occasionally host the "This Novel is Amazing!" contest.
Prior to the Sakoku Decree, Inazuma frequently exported toys, fireworks and kimonos. After the Shogun issued the decree, only ships affiliated with the Kanjou Commission could bring items in and out, resulting in less trade domestically and internationally. Even then, the fierce storms generated by the Shogun meant that few ships dared to brave them and many goods were lost in the process. Fishing also saw a decline as the Tenryou Commission saw boats of all sizes as escape vessels. After the Sakoku Decree was abolished, all of these are slowly returning to pre-decree levels.
Like Liyue, Inazuma also possesses a mining and smithing industry. Jakotsu Mine and the Mikage Furnace are well known in Inazuma, but the former closed after a "sickness" spread throughout the island, while the latter closed after the core went critical, threatening to leak Tatarigami energy until it was fixed, but even then, many are still hesitant to return. Inazuman swords are particularly well known due to the use of Jade Steel, a special material from Tatarasuna, although production has since halted following the peace treaty between Watatsumi and the Shogunate.
Fashion
Men's Fashion
Women's Fashion
Women in Inazuma tend to have bangs. Younger women tend to have their hair cut in a short bob, whereas older women tend to have their hair tied up in a bun.
Elderly women's attire in Watatsumi Island have the same coloring as the attire in Narukami Island, except inverted. This is a possible parallel between Watatsumi Island's worship of Orobashi and Narukami Island's worship of the Ei Raiden Shogun.
Fisher's Attire
Fishers in Inazuma do not have special clothing compared to other NPCs, but they can typically be distinguished by the Kasa (hat) 'kasa' hats they wear.
Samurai's Attire
The Nobushi can be primarily distinguished by their color palettes and their differences in 'kasa'. Jintouban wear a Nirayama-kasa ja=韮山笠.
Shogun's Army Uniform
The attire of the standard rank-and-file of the Shogun's Army uniforms are modeled after the 'ashigaru' ja=足軽 foot soldiers of feudal Japan. Their clothing cosists of a 'shitagi' (shirt), 'kobakama' (pants), whose colors varied, white socks and 'waraji' sandals. Their eggplant-colored armor consists of 'dou' (breastplate) with the Inazuma Shogunate's crest, 'kote' (armored sleeves), 'haidate' (thigh guards), and 'sune-ate' (greaves). Infantry only wear 'han-kote' (half-kote), while officers' sleeves were fully armored. Sometimes personnel, usually officiers, may be seen wearing a 'jingasa' ja=陣笠 with the crest of the Inazuma Shogunate. They are equipped with a 'juumonji yari' (cross-shaped spear), whose shaft is lavender colored, and contains the Shogunate crest under the spearhead. Higher-ranking officials, like the yoriki samurai, can be seen equipped with  'sode' (shoulder armor) on the left arm, wearing a 'kabuto' (helmet), and are barefoot in their 'waraji'. Instead of using 'yari', these samurai carried 'katanas' at their hips on the left side with the blade facing down.
The coloration of the clothing and armor accents indicates the ranking of the individual within the Shogun's Army. Low-ranking infantry personnel could be identified by their purple-gray 'shitagi', gray 'kobakama', and gray accents on their armor. Officers also wore purple-gray 'shitagi', but their lavender 'kobakama' pale gold accents on the armor indicated their higher ranking. The yoriki samurai and higher officials (e.g., Hatamoto) were distinguished with their lavender 'shitagi', indigo 'kobakama', and dark gold accented armor.
Watatsumi Army Uniform
Compared to the Shogun's Army (which consist of 3 attires), the Watatsumi Army's standard uniform is available in one design, so rankings were more intuitive within the army. Watatsumi Army's clothings consists of light red-white gradient 'shitagi' with a red-violet colored left sleeve, gray 'kobakama', and 'waraji' sandals without the socks. The Sangonomiya Clan's crest is imprinted on the back of the 'shitagi', below the neck. Additional features on the uniform's design such as breastplates and helmets are not present, compared to Shogun's Army uniforms, but were still equipped with 'sode', 'han-kote', 'haidate', and 'sune-ate' armor, whose colors were red and black with gold accents. The right shoulder guard has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest imprinted on it. The common weapon used among the ranks is the 'juumonji yari', whose shaft is colored with a red-white gradient and has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest under the spearhead.
Shrine Maiden's Attire
The standard shrine maiden uniform consists of a 'kosode' and 'hakama', white socks, and 'okobo' sandals. Shrine maidens at the Grand Narukami Shrine of Narukami Island wear a red 'hakama' and red accents on their outfit, while shrine maidens at the Sangonomiya Shrine and Mouun Shrine of Watatsumi Island wear a deep blue 'hakama' and deep blue accents on their outfit.

Politics
The Shogun is assisted by a group known as the Tri-Commission by its people; they act similarly to the collective of the Liyue Qixing and the Eight Trades, with each commission handling different responsibilities.A Path Through the StormWhile the English text of Atsuko during 'A Path Through the Storm' says it is roughly equivalent to "the Eight Trades under the Liyue Qixing" (emphasis added), both the Chinese and Japanese equivalents of the line simply say "Seven Stars (Qixing) and Eight Gates (Eight Trades)" zh=七星八门 zh_rm=Qīxīng Bāmén. In Imperial China, "[number] + [upper office] + [number] + [lower office]" was a common expression to refer to a national administrative system as a whole (rather than specific offices), as in "Three Lords and Nine Ministers" zh=三公九卿 zh_rm=Sāngōng Jiǔqīng and "Three Departments and Six Ministries" zh=三省六部 zh_rm=Sānshěng Liùbù.
The Tri-Commission consists of three commissions; the Kanjou Commission Kanjou, Tenryou Commission Tenryou and Yashiro Commission. Each one tends to their own duties and are led by a prestigious clan the Hiiragi Clan Hiiragi, Kujou Clan Kujou and Kamisato Clan respectively, who in turn lead less prestigious clans, such as the Takatsukasa Clan.
Due to each commission's close ties to the Shogun, when the commissioner is removed from their post (such as death or forced removal by the Shogun), it often leads to a time of instability for both the commission and the leading clan itself; as the leading clan is in threat of losing influence and prestige, while the clans and/or subordinates they were also leading try to take the position for themselves.The Wind SettlesTo Hear Mortal Hearts
The Kanjou Commission handles the nation's borders, checking documents of both foreigners and returning citizens. They were originally led by Hiiragi Shinsuke, who was dismissed for his role in the Fatui plot.
The Tenryou Commission handles the nation's security from all internal and external threats. They were originally led by Kujou Takayuki, who was dismissed for his role in the Fatui plot. Similarly to Shinsuke, an official successor has not been declared, though Kujou Kamaji currently fills the role as an acting proxy and Kujou Sara overseeing overall command of the Shogunate forces.
The Yashiro Commission handles the management of shrines, festivals and cultural events, being the most connected to the people. They are currently led by Kamisato Ayato. Outside of this, Ayato is also responsible for handling corrupt officials and the Shuumatsuban, a ninja organization that directly answers to him. The Shuumatsuban handle clandestine operations such as intelligence gathering and counter-ops.
Watatsumi Island is a unique outlier in that the island is mostly governed by the Divine Priestess of the Sangonomiya Clan due to the islanders' worship of Orobashi instead of Ei. The current Divine Priestess is Sangonomiya Kokomi, and the island has their own Watatsumi Army army, separate from that of the Shogun's.
Prior to the Traveler's arrival in Inazuma, Ei had enacted both the Vision Hunt and Sakoku Decree as she felt that they aligned with her ideals of eternity at the time. In reality, this was a Fatui plot intended to cause instability in the nation and market their Delusions, convincing both Shinsuke and Takayuki to collude with them. Takayuki would feed the Shogun false information about the war while Shinsuke would provide the Fatui with Crystal Marrow. While the Kamisato siblings were suspicious of the unusual circumstances and did not assist the Fatui, their lack of influence and the potential consequences did not result in much activity. The resulting Vision Hunt Decree caused a civil war between the Watatsumi Army and the Shogunate.
When the Traveler arrived, they were able to discover the whole truth of the plot and with the assistance of Yae Miko, convinced Ei to start listening to her people's wishes. After learning the full extent of the Fatui plot, she stripped both Shinsuke and Takayuki of their positions and roles, placing them under house arrest. The civil war subsequently concluded and talks were held between the Shogunate and Watatsumi Island. While spending more time with the Traveler,Reflections of MortalityTransient Dreams Ei came to realize that her beliefs had been wrong from the start and decided to take a more active role in giving her people the happiness they deserved, abolishing the Sakoku Decree.
Motto
One of the national mottos of Inazuma (especially one during military campaigns) is "Glory to the Shogun and her everlasting reign!"Inazuma, Interactable: Statue of The Seven
The corresponding motto in the Japanese localization and the Chinese original can be translated as "The one who hath spread the unchanging way is the eternal Narukami!", where the "unchanging way" means the unconditional truth of life and the universe, while Narukami ("Thundering God" or lit. "Roaring God") is a title of the Raiden Shogun ja=常道を恢弘せしは、永遠なる鳴神なり！ ja_rm=Joudou wo kaikou seshi wa, eien naru Narukami nari! zh=常道恢弘，鸣神永恒！ zh_rm=Chángdào huīhóng, Míngshén yǒnghéng! zh_lit=The unchanging way [is] immense, Narukami [is] eternal! sort=ja,zh.Etymologically, the archaic and literary phrase 'joudou wo kaikou seshi [mono]' ja=常道を恢弘せし[者] ja_tl=[The one who] hath spread the unchanging way probably comes from 恢弘至道 tl=spread the supreme way in 'Preface to the Book of Documents', an ancient Confucianist commentary text attributed to the Chinese philosopher Kong Anguo (156 BC? - 74 BC?). It was chosen here perhaps because Confucianism was the state philosophy of Tokugawa Shogunate of Japan. The "supreme way" is replaced here with the "unchanging way," a philosophical term from the first sentence of 'Tao Te Ching' by Laozi, the most important classic of Taoism.
Religion
Compared to Mondstadt and Liyue, Inazuma's religious devotion is much more visible in their culture, as Shogunate-held islands worship the Shogun. The people of Watatsumi Island worship Orobashi, due to the god's role in bringing them out of Enkanomiya.
A long time ago, a group of islanders on Tsurumi Island worshipped Kanna Kapatcir, calling her the Thunderbird and would offer human sacrifices in her name to appease her. Due to unusual circumstances surrounding the island, they did not have any contact with the rest of Inazuma, as they believed that certain death awaited those who left the island, as it was surrounded by a dense fog. This tribe was wiped out after Ruu sacrificed himself to appease the Thunderbird when he felt that the situation on the island was becoming worse, which enraged the entity as she saw his sacrifice as a broken promise.

Inazuma Travelogue
As a sailor, my dream has always been to explore all the regions of Teyvat. I haven't been on the fleet for long when I wrote this note. I was on the deck of the Black Ignis, headed towards Inazuma at the time. I'm a little embarrassed to say this, but this is my first time at sea. I felt overwhelmed facing the raging storm. The Chief Mate, Tongsheng, didn't seem particularly talkative, but he taught me a lot about sailing. The old sailor that lived with me told me many tales about Inazuma in his spare time. I wrote all these stories down to pass the time during the long voyage.
Inazuma, the land of eternity. It is said that the sea surrounding Inazuma is engulfed by storm and tempest. To break through the thunderstorms, one must rely on a fleet of experienced sailors and the strongest ships. But once you pass through the thunderstorms, Inazuma is surely a sight to behold. The first time I heard about it, I thought the sailors were exaggerating the storms to brag about their experiences. But yesterday, I experienced the impact of the violent thunderstorms and I must say, it is not easy to make a living on the vast ocean. This made me more fascinated with Inazuma. I must say, after being on the water for so long, I miss life on land and the feeling of my feet on soil. I miss the musky scent of the earth. But if I had to choose again, I would not hesitate to step back on deck. After all, life at sea is so much more interesting than the day-to-day life, and there are so many unknown areas to explore and stories to be heard.
It is said that the customs in Inazuma are very different from those of other countries. Unlike Mondstadt or Liyue, Inazuma is located in the distant sea and consists of many islands. There are several small islands scattered around the large islands, and the people on those islands rely heavily on ships to communicate with each other.
We are currently sailing towards Ritou, that is part of Narukami Island. Inazuma City is located on Narukami Island. Cherry blossoms are planted all over this island. In the season when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom, the petals are like clouds. When walking underneath them, they will fall like rain and you will soon notice you are covered in cherry blossom petals... The old sailor proudly showed me a painting of a Shrine in Inazuma. It showed that it was his meticulous work. The blooming cherry blossoms are indeed unforgettable.
Ritou is the only way to enter Inazuma for outlanders. Before stepping onto Inazuma, you must go through the administrative formalities with the Kanjou Commission, or you might run into trouble. The old sailor said in a serious tone that made me think he must have had experienced it before. But once you enter Ritou, you can take a breather and enjoy the atmosphere and customs of Inazuma.
After being on the sea for so long, I long for food on land. Looks like there are many specialty cuisine in Inazuma? The old sailor described to me an Inazuman dish called Sakura Tempura: golden and crisp on the outside, but with a faint fragrance of cherry blossoms. When you bite into it, the shell is fragrant and crispy, with a delicious filling. Having said that, the old sailor swallowed and I felt a little hungry myself. I looked forward to Inazuma that much more.
It's time for me to get back to work on deck, my note today shall end here. There is a faint rumble of a thunderstorm in the distance. I've heard that the Raiden Shogun is responsible for this. I guess there must be a reason behind it. If you have free time, talk about the old tales of Inazuma with the old sailor. I think the stories are very interesting. I still have a small bottle of treasured wine in my bag, which would be perfect for a time like this...

<title>Alberich Clan</title>
<text>The Alberich Clan is a Khaenri'ahn clan of nobility status. It is best known for two things, both of which took place during or after the cataclysm 500 years ago: its role as the substitute leaders of Khaenri'ah when Irmin King Irmin was unable to rule, and as the founders of the Abyss Order.
The clan managed to survive the kingdom of Khaenri'ah's destruction during the cataclysm and has continued its lineage to the present day, with Kaeya as part of the current generation.

The Alberich Clan was a clan of pure-blooded Khaenri'ahn nobles with a lineage dating back to, at the very earliest, the late Eclipse Dynasty. Because of their status, Chlothar Chlothar Alberich had access to the Royal Library of Khaenri'ah, employed servants, and was held to very restrictive standards; however, he was not reputable enough that he personally knew the Traveler's sibling, who had been granted a royal title.Portended Fate
At some point, Chlothar fell in love with a woman from Mondstadt who had come to Khaenri'ah and had a son, Caribert (NPC) Caribert, with her. However, due to her commoner status, their relationship was not accepted by other members of the Alberich Clan and Chlothar was unable to protect his lover or illegitimate son.Fortune-Mocking Pedigree
Meanwhile, Anfortas, the Knight Marshal and leader of the Schwanenritter, was of high enough standing that he was able to personally give counsel to King Irmin.Interactable: Gavireh Lajavard Someone's Abandoned Letter Someone's Abandoned Letter While his background is unknown, he can be deduced to be a member of the Alberich Clan given that he became Regent when Irmin was "indisposed,"Interactable: Gavireh Lajavard Barely-Legible Bulletin Barely-Legible Bulletin and the present-day Alberich Clan claims that "it was the Alberich Clan, who did not have royal blood, who stepped in as regents when the strength of the one-eyed king Irmin failed."Event Hidden Strife Interactable: Hidden Strife Story The Brick The Brick
The Cataclysm
When King Irmin was in an "indisposed state" and could not handle the threat of dark beasts attacking the kingdom, Anfortas declared himself Regent without any currently known resistance. Anfortas and the Schwanenritter made the decision to evacuate able-bodied survivors to the surface,Interactable: Gavireh Lajavard Ancient Journal Ancient Journal using the Mechanical Wardens - likely referring to what are now known as Ruin Golems - to fight against the dark beasts.Interactable: Realm of Farakhkert Soiled Orders Soiled Orders Anfortas was the last surviving Schwanenritter and presumably died in Dharma Forest;Cryptic Message in SumeruAchievement Description: In the Name of Anfortas their last operating Ruin Golem can be found at Devantaka Mountain, and Nagarjuna fought alongside the Schwanenritter before leading his Darshan to the Girdle of the Sands to carry out the Schwanenritter's will of completely destroying the dark disaster.The Hymn of Tir Yazad (Part 2)
Chlothar and Caribert were in Khaenri'ah when the gods laid down curses on them. Due to his pure-blooded lineage, Chlothar was cursed with immortality while Caribert was given the "curse of wilderness" and transformed into a hilichurl. What exactly happened to Chlothar's lover is never addressed, but she is implied to have been killed at some point during Khaenri'ah's destruction.
After the Cataclysm
Following the cataclysm, desperate to do something for his son even if the curse could not be broken, Chlothar traveled to Sumeru to make a medicine that would supposedly restore Caribert's intelligence and consciousness, enlisting the help of the Traveler's sibling when they stumbled into each other. After failing to obtain power from the God of Wisdom, Abyssal power from Voice Inside the Head an unknown "Sinner" was discovered underground and obtained instead. The medicine imbued with the power of the Abyss worked on Caribert, earning the Abyss a devout follower in Chlothar. However, Caribert remained a hilichurl and was eventually unable to handle the power of the Abyss. Caribert eventually took off his mask, and after becoming enveloped in Abyssal power, he disappeared; his exact fate is unknown.
After Caribert's disappearance, Chlothar called Caribert the "Loom of Fate," believing the absent Caribert to be free to rewrite his own fate. Chlothar went on to found the Abyss Order, as he still saw the "Sinner" as his and Caribert's salvation as fellow "sinners." It is suggested that this series of events was also what convinced the Traveler's sibling to side with the Abyss.
After a hundred years, Chlothar went insane. At an unknown point in time, Chlothar also discovered a way to rid himself of his curse of immortality. He eventually died and was buried together with an unknown female, suggested to be Caribert's mother, in the field where the Strange Mushrooms grew. It is unknown who buried them, but it is suggested that Chlothar buried his wife there before meeting the Traveler's sibling.Chlothar avoids explaining what happened to Caribert's mother, while the Strange Mushrooms' item description and the Traveler during 'Fortune-Mocking Pedigree' both call into question the mushrooms' growing conditions. Much to the Traveler's alarm, watering the field attracted Fungi, which prompted them to find out what was buried underneath after waking up. They unearthed the two skeletons, and Dainsleif notes that the male skeleton was interred much later than the female one.
Present Day
Because of Chlothar's role in establishing the Abyss Order, Dainsleif calls Kaeya a "descendant of the Abyss Order's founder," while Kaeya states that the revelation confirms some "old suspicions" of his and this association may be the reason why his biological father left him in Mondstadt as a child.Destined Encounter Interestingly, the Alberich Clan history Kaeya was taught as a child - or at least, the part he secretly saved, as the present-day Alberich Clan does not keep written records of their affairs - emphasizes Anfortas' role in the clan's history, although it is currently impossible to determine the relationship between Anfortas and Chlothar, nor does Dainsleif indicate whether Kaeya is a lineal or collateral descendant of Chlothar's.
It is unknown what the Alberich Clan's current goal is, although it is suggested that they seek to wage war against the seven nations of Teyvat. Kaeya's biological father left him in Mondstadt as an "agent of Khaenri'ah," calling Kaeya "our last hope" or "our only hope"Aroma of the Past (Quest) while Kaeya previously struggled between where his loyalties would lie should Khaenri'ah and Mondstadt go to war. Currently, Kaeya has distanced himself from his past and has no intention of carrying out his original duty, and considers the Abyss Order his enemies.Crash Course Dainsleif and Mona, however, both question whether he will be able to maintain that distance in the future.

<title>Tenoch</title>
<text>Tenoch was a battle-hardened warrior from Natlan that existed before the creation of the Mare Jivari - possibly around 1000 years agoThe earliest mention of the Mare Jivari is in the Wanderer's Troupe artifact set. The characters mentioned in the set existed during Mondstadt Aristocracy Mondstadt's Aristocracy period but before Vennessa's rebellion, which is known to have taken place about 1000 years before the start of the game. This suggests that the latest date for this story to have occurred was at least 1000 years ago.Artifact Set: Wanderer's Troupe - and who wielded the giant obsidian club Talking Stick. He created a fellowship of six warriors from each of the six major tribes of Natlan - of which he belonged to none -  in order to fight against a growing threat on Natlan's horizon.Talking Stick It is implied that he died during this fight in a heroic final battle.
Profile
Tenoch was a warrior-hero from Natlan who wielded a large obsidian-inlaid club. He did not to belong to any of the six major tribes, as it is said that he was chased away or expelled from his former tribe; perhaps for his propensity for battle. Although he didn't belong to any tribe, some members of other tribes and Tenoch's former friends had much respect for him. Tenoch also had many enemies, one of which was an infamous giant named Tupac, with whom he exchanged many injuries and scars. The club Tenoch wielded was known as the Talking Stick, as it is implied that he used it to "mediate" discussions and disputes. With his club, Tenoch journeyed across Natlan recruiting six warriors to fight with him against a "turbid black tide" he saw on the horizon. His fate is left uncertain after he begins his "final battle" against a mountain of darkness, though it is implied he perished during the fight.
Appearance
Tenoch is described as having many scars on his body, as well as possibly a missing or blinded eye. It is also implied that Tenoch is at least middle-aged.
Story
~>1000 years ago
Tenoch, a lone warrior without a tribe, stood amongst the burning plains of Natlan and witnessed a darkness growing on the horizon. Suspecting an immediate danger, he blew his bronze horn but to no reply. He lamented that the tribal leaders were too absorbed in their squabbles to recognize the danger. It is here where he set out on a mission to recruit allies in order to do battle against the growing darkness.
First, Tenoch meets with a former traveling partner, Wanjiru, known as "the great runner," and her companion, Kayeke. Wanjiru, scarred from her previous adventures with Tenoch, is worn out from the tribes' endless bickering, but she becomes enthusiastic from Tenoch's proposal, knowing a battle was imminent.
Tenoch then meets with a brave man by the name of Menilek, and his companion Ngoubou, who welcomes Tenoch with open arms as a brother and revered hero. This meeting is followed by one with "the cunning Sanhaj Kompore and his enigmatic companion Mahamba." It is implied here that Tenoch had used his club against Sanhaj in the past and that his recruitment was not entirely voluntary, though Tenoch did preemptively offer him the rewards of their fellowship should Sanhaj agree to join. Sanhaj, who had seen the future result of the upcoming battle and the creation of the Mare Jivari, reluctantly agreed in the hopes that he would be seen as a hero in future stories.
Tenoch then proceeded to meet with a young and inexperienced man named Burkina and his own companion Kongamato. Burkina looked up to Tenoch, though he had no battle experience of his own. Knowing he might one day walk the same path of a warrior as Tenoch, and guided by Tenoch's club and legacy, Burkina voluntarily joined the group of warriors.
Though there was some bitter history between the two, Sundjatta, "chief of the mines," was the fifth person to be persuaded by Tenoch, and was joined by his companion Muhuru. Sundjatta was one who had previously petitioned the then Murata Pyro Archon - possibly Murata - to expel Tenoch from his tribe. He tells Tenoch that it was because he wished for stability and a cease to conflict that he did so. He agreed to go with Tenoch as he too imagined it would be the last battle of their generation, but also on the condition that his tribe be left out of any ensuing conflict.
The final member to join the fellowship was Tenoch's old rival, Tupac, whom he had previously engaged in many battles against. Upon Tenoch's arrival at Tupac's home, the two remark on how they've left each other with many injuries. They both then begin laughing hysterically before joining forces.
Having recruited some allies from each of the six major tribes, Tenoch and his comrades then clashed with the danger for which they had assembled to fight against.

<title>Haishan</title>
<text>Haishan zh=海山 zh_rm=Hǎishān is the name of a sea monster slain by Beidou, with the help of The Crux fleet. It has been described as both a "hydra" and a "leviathan," resembling both dragon and fish at once. After slaying Haishan, Beidou received her Electro Vision.
Beidou's feat has become legendary among the citizens of Liyue, and even impressed the adeptus Xiao. Tea Master Liu Su also recounts the tale through The Wrath of Haishan in the Commission 'Cliffhanger'.
History
Haishan's age and origin is unknown, but it lived in Teyvat's oceans. It was said that all merchants and traders who sailed the ocean were bound to encounter Haishan at some point. As a child, Beidou loved hearing tales of sea monsters, and had dreamed of defeating Haishan ever since she was nine years old.
After Beidou became captain of The Crux, she would run into Haishan many times, but never succeeded in killing the leviathan until one fateful day. As she and her crew sang a sea shanty about the monster to bolster themselves, the fleet attacked Haishan with cannons and harpoons. While Haishan was bound by the arrows and ropes, ensuring that it would not be able to escape easily, Beidou fought the monster with her best greatsword in hand. This battle raged fiercely for four days.
The sailors were disadvantaged by their limited visibility at night, so they had to remain constantly vigilant against Haishan's attacks. On the last night, Beidou stood upon her ship's prow without eating or drinking, listening for Haishan's movements. When dawn broke, she heard a change in the sound of the waves, and beheaded the monster in a single lethal strike. A bolt of lightning struck the sea right in front of Beidou, and an Electro Vision descended out of the sky to her.

<title>Seven Sovereigns</title>
<text>The Seven Sovereigns are the seven strongest elemental dragons of their respective element.Three Realms Gateway Offering: The Eve The original Seven Sovereigns ruled the old world and held the seven elemental Authorities, but lost both their status and part of their powers when the Primordial One came to this world and created a new order over the world.Calamitous TreadThe Byakuyakoku Collection
The Sovereigns' stolen Authorities were eventually used as the basis for the The Seven Archons' Authorities, which are bound to The Seven's divine seats. As a result, the living Sovereigns cannot utilize their full abilities unless their corresponding Archon dies and returns the Authority to them.
Overview
Like all vishaps and elemental dragons, the Seven Sovereigns are creatures of the Light Realm and each harnesses one of the primordial elements. The Seven Sovereigns were the mightiest among dragon-kind and ruled over the old world and its seven nations.
When the Primordial One - also referred to as the Heavenly PrinciplesIn 'Calamitous Tread', Neuvillette states that the first usurper took the elemental Authorities from the Seven Sovereigns. Later, in 'The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur', Focalors states that the Heavenly Principles were guilty of stealing the Sovereigns' Authorities. - appeared, it took part of the Sovereigns' authorities for itself. It and its Four Shades four shining shades waged war against the Seven Sovereigns and after a long struggle, the Primordial One vanquished the Seven Sovereigns, while those who refused to yield to the Primordial One fled into the ocean depths. Afterwards, the world was remade to be suitable for humanity and the Human Realm was established by breaking down the raw, primordial elements.Coral Butterfly
With the original Seven Sovereigns' power fading away, a new generation is being born.Bolteater Bathysmal Vishap Hatchling However, because a Sovereign's dragonhood is intertwined with the elemental Authorities, which were used as the basis for the Archon's Authorities, none of the living Sovereigns can access their full abilities or memories of the old world until the Archon's divine seat is destroyed and their Authority returned. As of the end of the Masquerade of the Guilty, the Hydro Sovereign's authority has been fully restored.The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur
Sovereigns can only be born from dragons who are elementally pure. As such, the next Hydro Sovereign was not born from the Bathysmal Vishaps, who strayed from their "pure" Hydro forms into "impure" Cryo and Electro variants.The Byakuyakoku Collection
Story
The Old World
Before the Primordial One's arrival, the Seven Sovereigns controlled the world's original order with their elemental authorities. The original Dragon of Water, in particular, controlled the Primordial Sea, which created all life in the world. However, after the Primordial One took portions of their authorities and established a new order over the world, "outside life forms" were introduced to the world and the creation of life no longer relied on the Primordial Sea; a notable exception was Egeria, who was created as a replacement "heart" for the Primordial Sea using "all original matter from this world, entirely without outside elements."Wings of Merciful, Wrathful Waters
The New World
To combat the Primordial One's power, the Dragon King Nibelung brought forbidden knowledge to this worldWhat Shape Does the Self Hold and waged a "great war of vengeance" against the Primordial One. While it still ended with Nibelung and the dragons' defeat, they succeeded in severely weakening the Primordial One.
To suppress forbidden knowledge, the Primordial One sent down the divine nails, drastically changing the environment and causing the demise of several human civilizations. Because the Primordial One was also unable to continue suppressing the old world with its own absolute authority, it and another entity used the remains of the Third Descender to create the seven Gnoses. A new order was established yet again, in which the gods were whittled down to the Seven Archons through the Archon War while humans were only able to utilize one of the seven elements' powers by obtaining a Vision.Neuvillette's Vision story states that "all fragments of the primordial were driven to devour each other" following the Gnoses' creation, which aligns with Soraya's line in the Treasure Lost, Treasure Found (Part 2) about the Archon War starting when seven divine thrones - the Archons' seats - opened up in Celestia.
Around 500 years ago, Neuvillette - the new Hydro Sovereign, born in human form as the Enkanomiyans had prophesied - was invited by the new Hydro Archon Focalors to become the Chief Justice of Fontaine. Although initially uninterested in humanity, Neuvillette agreed in order to uncover of his missing memories regarding his powers.A Familiar Threat
Present Day
In Homecoming, the Dendro Archon Lesser Lord Kusanali, Paimon, and the Traveler meet the Dendro Sovereign Apep. Despite Apep's initial hostility towards anyone related to the old world's usurpers, it calms down after the three successfully purge the forbidden knowledge eating away at it. While still dissatisfied with the current world order, it explains the Sovereigns' past to them and decides to simply observe humanity and the gods for the time being.
During the events of Masquerade of the Guilty, the second-to-last Hydro Archon Focalors is put on trial for the "original sin" that the Heavenly Principles had declared on Egeria. This trial reveals that Furina is not the real Hydro Archon but rather, as the "humanity" of Focalors, who has played the role of the Archon for 500 years while Focalors orchestrates her plan to deceive the Heavenly Principles. However, a death sentence was issued, and Focalors soon reveals her plan to Neuvillette, saying that acquiring the stolen power of the Hydro Sovereign is not true to her ideal of justice. This plan becomes successful when the Indemnitium acquired through the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale forms a giant blade that proceeds to execute her, resulting in the destruction of the Hydro Archon's throne. After Focalors' death, Neuvillette's original authority is returned to him, making him in absolute control of the Hydro element.The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur

<title>Neko</title>
<text>Neko ja=寝子 ja_rm=Neko ja_tl=Sleeping Child is a Black Cat and NPC located in Asase Shrine, Seirai Island, Inazuma.
Profile
Neko is a cat that has lived for at least 500 years, during the cataclysm and the time of Asase Hibiki and Ako Domeki. She and the other cats presumably lived at Asase Shrine and enjoyed spending time with Hibiki as she created Invigorating Kitty Meal delicious meals for all to share. Unbeknownst to Neko, Hibiki drastically changed after the events of the cataclysm, and while she managed to live a relatively normal life after returning from the Grand Narukami Shrine, she had been deeply affected by the deaths of Takamine the Mistsplitter and the Kitsune Saiguu. She later helped Domeki fight off a Shogunate fleet despite the pirate's insistence that she stay out of his affairs, breaking the wards and unleashing a Thunder Manifestation, causing a huge thunderstorm that resulted in Hibiki and Domeki disappearing.
The island would remain in mostly perpetual thunderstorms and Neko waited at the shrine, hoping for Hibiki's return and took the position of Provisional Head Priestess at the shrine to keep the place intact, but she and the remaining cats were unable to maintain the shrine and it fell into disrepair. Domeki and his fleet eventually returned to the island, but it had fallen into ruins due to the Thunder Manifestation and they left to set sail for other lands. Neko appeared to be unaware of his return.
500 years later, Seirai Island would be visited by Etsuko, Taisuke, and the Traveler. The former two were part of the Adventurers' Guild, commissioned to investigate the island and discovered the broken wards, while the Traveler had just set foot and was encountered the two. The Traveler offered to help them and used Elemental Sight to discover cat tracks leading to the shrine, where they met Neko. Neko told them that the shrine had fallen into disrepair and had them repair the shrine's offering box so people could deposit Mora, unaware that the village had been abandoned for hundreds of years. Once they did so, she told them how to repair the wards, which ended the thunderstorms and made the cats comfortable.
After the thunderstorms around the island were dealt with, Neko would task the Traveler with putting the shrine back in order and helping out the cats in her care. After "hiring" Ooshima Junpei to create a statue of her, upon performing the finishing touch, a cloud overhead shaped itself into a cat, which Neko interpreted as a good sign from Hibiki and the others. Neko promised to introduce the four to Hibiki and her friends when they returned and began making preparations for their eventual arrival. After taking a stroll around the island, she discovered that the village was devoid of life and wondered where their inhabitants had gone, unaware of the events that had taken place back then.
Neko eventually heard of the Grand Narukami Shrine and requested the Traveler bring her there. She was amazed by the shrine's large offering box, although still stating that her shrine was better. After inquiring about Hibiki, she decided to return to her shrine and continue waiting for Hibiki's return.
Appearance
Neko has the appearance of a black cat with large, golden eyes. She is also notably larger in size compared to regular cats.As seen in 'Neko Is a Cat: The Children', when "Konbumaru" and "Hachihou" are placed beside her.

<title>Klee/Lore</title>
<text>Knights of Favonius Spark Knight! Forever with a bang and a flash!-And then disappearing from the stern gaze of Acting Grand Master Jean.Sure, time in solitary confinement gives lots of time to think about new gunpowder formulas...But it'd still be better to not be in solitary in the first place.
Personality
An explosives expert and a regular at the Knights of Favonius's confinement room. Also known as Fleeing Sunlight.
Klee is an energetic and outgoing girl who takes after her mother, Alice. She has a particular talent for creating explosives and is not fazed by the sound of explosions. She adores anything that can blow up like her bombs, such as Amber's Baron Bunny. She acts like a typical energetic young child who loves playing with her friends. Unfortunately, her definition of playing usually involves explosives; she is particularly fond of "fish blasting", tossing bombs into lakes full of fish.
In part due to her young age, Klee can be very naïve at times and easily confused by topics she doesn't have any context for, such as mistaking Mondstadt's wine industry for a monster, and wondering why Diluc is always grumpy, even going as far as to call him the "weird grown-up". Klee is not fond of seeing people argue, as she believes that they only come when someone was in the wrong and that it doesn't feel right to her.Zip Along (According to Safe Cart Operating Procedures)
While she's considered an official member of the Knights of Favonius, Klee's antics often get her into trouble. Like any child, she often tries to flee to avoid being reprimanded, but is eventually caught by Jean who sends her to solitary confinement to self-reflect. While she occasionally does try to do so, she almost always quickly forgets and instead uses the time to brainstorm new bombs and explosives.
Klee loves her fellow knights, and is well-loved by them in turn. She is particularly fond of Kaeya and Albedo. Whenever she heads out of the city to play, she always follows the "survival rules" which Kaeya gave her. Albedo, on the other hand, is an older brother figure who takes care of her. She is also quite fond of Diona, even catching fish to share and offering her Dodoco to pet when Klee unintentionally upsets her. She loves her parents, though she does not see them frequently as they often travel around Teyvat and thus have little time to spend with her.
Appearance
Shooting Spark
Klee uses the Short Female Characters short female model. She has pale skin, light red eyes, pale blonde hair with a prominent cowlick, and elf ears.While Klee's ears can be described as "elf ears," it is unclear if Klee herself is an elf. Further information can be found in Alice Trivia.
Official Introduction
Klee: The Happy Little Spark... always getting locked up in solitary confinement
If the hills burn, Klee will be done for!
▌Fleeing Sunlight · Klee
The Happy Little Spark... always getting locked up in solitary confinement
In the streets and back alleys of Mondstadt, it is said that there is a girl in red, who holds an unparalleled treasure within the Knights of Favonius.
No matter where or when this girl appears, it's not long before everything goes up in flames.
What's more, as the aftermath of the explosions fades away, she disappears without a trace - there are few who have ever seen her face.
Amongst the swirling rumors, there are even those that go so far to say that she is the most powerful within the Knights of Favonius.
Though as far as Acting Grand Master Jean is concerned, using this power for such destruction simply means...
Solitary confinement's gonna need some upgrades!
Character Stories
When the patrons of Mondstadt's taverns are asked about the strongest knight of the Knights of Favonius, three names are likely to come up:The highly reputable Acting Grand Master Jean, Cavalry Captain Kaeya, and the mysterious tycoon, Diluc.However, some claim to have witnessed, albeit through bleary, drunken eyes, a knight in red, leveling the entire Stormbearer Mountains.If one wants to find this mysterious knight, then they need look no further than the solitary confinement cell inside the Knights of Favonius Headquarters.If the cell is found vacant... then something explosively unfortunate is likely about to take place...Klee is well known for the danger she presents. As an official member of the Knights of Favonius, her strength in combat cannot be underestimated.As a hyperactive child, meanwhile, her destructive capabilities cannot be overstated.After all, while other Mondstadt children her age are still playing with regular toys, Klee's favorite toys are... live explosives.
Three years ago, Klee was entrusted to the Knights of Favonius by her parents, who were famed adventurers.This was how the fates of Klee and  Albedo "that boy in white" became intertwined with their "family" in Mondstadt.Klee is curious about everything in the outside world. She has an innocent passion for explosives, and is incredibly enthusiastic in all that she does.Under the protection of the Knights of Favonius, she is protected from harm and those of ill intent.This young girl soon forged an unbreakable bond with everyone in the Knights of Favonius.Being sent to the solitary confinement room by Jean, helping Amber improving Baron Bunny, as well as developing new bombs...These parts of Klee's life are all invaluable treasures to her.
"The apple doesn't fall far from the tree..."Jean sighs to herself as she sits down at her desk, head in hands, faced once again with a stack of damage reports.Carts blasted beyond repair, storage shacks burnt down, forest fires that the knights barely managed to contain...Not to mention the suspiciously high number of deaths from unnatural causes among the fish of Starfell Lake.There's only one potential culprit behind all of this, and she just so happens to be one of their own..."Klee!"Faced with Jean's stern glare, the harmless-looking Klee surrenders all her concealed explosives.She is then escorted to solitary confinement, despite her protests amidst floods of tears.This occurs about once or twice a week at the Knights of Favonius.
Of course, Klee always tries to help clean up the messes she's made.However, sometimes her reckless personality makes things worse still.For example, she once wanted to apologize to everyone by making some BBQ fish, but ended up blowing the stove sky-high.Then there was the time she got into a fluster and tried to put the fire out... with wind - which obviously resulted in the whole plain going up in flames.Klee is not a bad kid by nature, it's just that her curious and playful nature always results in her failing to think before she acts.And every time she gets into trouble, she guiltily tries to make up for it.Though once Jean lets Klee out of solitary confinement, there's usually no more than a day or two before the sound of explosions return to Mondstadt.The "Spark Knight" always manages to live up to her title in a range of unexpected ways.
Though Klee always ends up causing trouble for the Knights of Favonius and Mondstadt, she isn't just some rookie who drags the team down.On the contrary, her skills with explosives can be quite handy if applied correctly.Once, Jean was able to defeat a horde of invading hilichurls utilizing Klee's special talents alone.However, Klee also forever changed the face of Stormbearer Mountains in that same operation due to recklessly placing too many charges...Needless to say, everyone was more than a little shocked, but at least no one from the Knights of Favonius was injured.Since then, the legend of the "Red Knight of the Stormbearer Mountains" began to circulate around Mondstadt.Rumor has it that she is cloaked in red, and clutches the greatest treasure the Knights of Favonius have.However, only Klee knows what this "treasure" truly is.
To Klee, the Knights of Favonius are family, and she can't imagine life without them. Her biggest role model, however, is still her birth mother - the avid adventurer, Alice.A highly renowned adventurer and author of the popular Teyvat Travel Guide, there is nothing this incredible mother cannot do - as far as Klee is concerned, anyway.Whether it's the way she used to guide Klee step-by-step through the techniques for adding gunpowder and selecting fuses, or the encouragement she'd give Klee to express her creativity through ever-bolder and more beautiful fireworks...Or that time she taught her how to identify Starsnatch Cliff's load-bearing points, then place explosive charges accordingly to bring the whole thing down...Or that time they stuck their tongues out at each other awkwardly while being told off by Huffman of the Knights of Favonius...Klee has many treasured memories of her mother.This was the way things were until her parents left to travel to somewhere dangerous and far away. They entrusted Klee to the care of Albedo and the Knights of Favonius.Though still small, Klee knew she would one day become just like her mother.One day, her explosives would become something that her mother would be proud of.
Dodoco is Klee's first friend, and one of her best.A very long time ago, her mother made this doll for her by hand.Alice affixed it to Klee's four-leaf clover, and hung on her big backpack.From that day forth, Klee and Dodoco became inseparable.Her mother said that this would ensure that Klee would never be lonely and that she would have a friend to confide in even when she was alone.They would also protect each other in times of danger, just like Amber and Baron Bunny.This, however, caused the Knights no need of worry - considering the other things Alice and her daughter had invented, perhaps this, too, might explode at any time..."Dodoco" is a name Klee picked herself.When asked what this name meant, she flushed red for a good long while before replying: "It means... Klee's best friend!"
Asking Klee how she obtained a Vision will probably get you nowhere - she doesn't know, either.A natural-born pyromaniac, Klee had already been acknowledged by a Vision from a very young age.According to Klee herself, she had been creating a bomb that was "even bigger than super big!"This was her very first solo project, but the results were far from expected-Well, she "only" blew her small workshop sky high, leaving a mountain of smoking ash.But rather than being disappointed, Klee was pleasantly surprised to see a flaming Vision emerge from those ashes.How did Klee receive this divine acknowledgment?Was it her talent and passion for explosives, the individualistic nature she got from her mother, or her shining innocence?Regardless, Klee had already obtained such a coveted item at a tender, carefree age.Regardless of what she faces as she grows up, she will never give this "present" up.

<title>Fujin</title>
<text>Fujin is an NPC that first appears in Qiaoying of the Sacred Mountain. She is an adeptus from Chenyu Vale, Liyue. After finishing Rainjade's Benediction, she can randomly be found outside of Qiaoying Village with Lingyuan or with Little Mao.
Profile
Fujin, along with Herblord, was once the servant of an unnamed god. She was also good friends with Herblord and Lingyuan. Originally a giant golden carp who lived in the rivers of Chenyu Vale, Fujin was worshiped as an adeptus during her lifetime and was known to be close to humanity — she took on a human form and conducted the Rainjade Rite, an ancient ritual which “changed” the water veins and soil of Chenyu Vale and made them more palatable to humans. She also planted the first tea tree, which would one day grow the same tea leaves that Chenyu Vale would come to be known for.An Ancient Sacrifice of Sacred Brocade
When the Archon War came to Liyue, Fujin’s master caused the Bishui River to flood in a final attempt to defeat Rex Lapis Morax, an act which would have destroyed Chenyu Vale. Seeing this, Fujin and Herblord defected against their god, banding together to save the people of Chenyu Vale. While Lingyuan herded them to shelter, Herblord fought against their former master, and Fujin climbed Mt. Lingmeng and hurled the Votive Rainjade into the waters. Their collective efforts would save Chenyu Vale; however, Herblord perished during the battle, and Fujin “sank into the sea,” losing much of her strength. She would be trapped at Carp’s Rest for thousands of years, only able to reminisce about the outside world through the scent of tea offerings.
Eventually, when the Traveler first steps foot in Chenyu Vale, they encounter Fujin, who explains that the soil and waters of the vale are on the decline, putting Qiaoying Village in danger as they were experiencing bad tea harvests. The Traveler agrees to help her in performing the Rainjade Rite to restore the land, and she loans them some of her powers so they could traverse the land. During the events of the World Quest series, Fujin is shocked to discover that her friend Lingyuan was responsible for damaging the environment. Once she was brought back to her senses, Fujin performed the rite, restoring the soil and water, though the miasma brought about by Lingyuan's tampering of the spirit lines would still persist. The act also caused her to lose much of her energy, reverting her back to her original form as a carp.
Collecting all the Spirit Carp in Chenyu Vale and maximizing the level of Rainjade's Benediction will cause Fujin to accumulate enough energy to regain her human form. She can be then be found in several locations around Chenyu Vale, such as looking over Qiaoying Village.</text>

<title>Aria, Sonnet and Canon</title>
<text>Aria, Sonnet, and Canon,Heart's Desire: Sapphire collectively known as the moon sisters, are one of the oldest known beings in Teyvat mythos alongside the ancient Seelie. They dwelled in the Lunar Palace and switched sovereignty over the night sky at regular intervals. Following a certain great calamity, the three sisters ended up clashing and killing each other; only one of their corpses continues to illuminate the sky.Moonlit Bamboo Forest
Profile
Just as legends claim that [...] once there were three bright moons in the night sky named Aria, Sonnet and Canon, sisters who were parted by death in a great catastrophe.
Story
According to legend, the moon sisters are older than Morax,Solar Relic who himself is over 6,000 years old.Solitary Fragrance They were the sovereigns of the night sky who dwelled in the Lunar Palace and rode through the heavens in a silver carriage. Sovereignty was held by one sister at a time, switching places three times a month.Instead of saying that the sisters alternated "thrice a month," the original Chinese text says they alternated after "one 'xún'" zh=一旬, where a 'xún' can mean ten days, ten years, or an unspecified amount of time. The English localization assumed ten days, as thirty days roughly comprises one lunar month. The three sisters were all in love with the morning stars, and it is said that their love for the morning stars was "equal" to the affection between the sisters.
The Ancient Calamity
At some point, the Lunar Palace was host to the union of a Seelie ancestor and an outlander, with the moon sisters as witnesses. Thirty days later, the calamity that overturned the heavens and earth descended on the world: the lovers went on a self-imposed exile and attempted to flee, but the disaster caught up to them. As punishment, the two were separated for eternity and had their memories wiped. The heartbroken Seelie withered away, shedding parts of their former selves which then transformed into the Seelie's current wispy forms.Records of Jueyun
The great disaster overturned the sisters' carriage and ransacked the palace of the stars. The moon sisters turned on each other, ultimately ending with their mutual deaths. The moon in the Teyvat night sky is said to be one of their corpses. Around the same time as their deaths, the sun chariot piloted by the morning stars fell into the plains west of Liyue, creating The Chasm (Subregion) The Chasm and Dunyu Ruins.Records of Jueyun
Legacy
The morning stars survived the calamities, as did the wolves, who are said to be "children of the moons." The wolves remember the tragedy behind the sisters' tale, and those who live among wolves call the morning stars the "grievous stars." Gods and adepti that heard the story of the moon sisters would "feel sentimental upon hearing such ancient memories."
The concept of the moon(s) recurs throughout Teyvat lore and shows up both in-universe and in gameplay elements. For example, the names "Mondstadt" and "Liyue" both make reference to the word 'moon' via 'Mond' and 'Yue', respectively. According to folk legends, the Solar Chariot that fell into The Chasm (Subregion) The Chasm was repaired by the tribespeople who lived there and eventually returned to the heavens; in other renditions of the tale, the sun chariot was a star which "leaped away" and returned to the heavens during the time "countless gods and rulers fought over the appointed celestial seats."
The Spiral Abyss is a massive underground city built by a ruined civilization. It has several deep connections with the moon: Within it is a structure known as the Abyssal Moon Spire, in which the moon is clearly visible. The lunar phase within the city shifts twice a month in a phenomenon known as the Moment of Syzygy, which brings new rewards with it. The change in lunar phase has been referred to as "gears turn[ing]."{Official Description: Spiral Abyss Official Description Moment of Syzygy It should also be noted the moon above Teyvat and that within the abyss are clearly distinct perhaps indicating they are the corpses of two distinct moon goddesses.
The Blessing of the Welkin Moon is a gameplay feature that features a card of an unidentified white-haired, purple-robed feminine figure surrounded by Primogems, with an upright triquetra underneath and a waning crescent moon behind her. Notably, the word "welkin" means "sky" or "heaven," making the name of this moon the Heavenly Moon.

<title>Pantalone</title>
<text>Pantalone, also known by his codename "Regrator," is the Ninth of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers.
He makes his first appearance during '' alongside his fellow Harbingers.
Profile
Pantalone was born into poverty and was never able to receive a Vision, leading him to question why gods held control over so many aspects of life, including things they ostensibly did not need, such as Mora. This instilled him with an obsession with "fair exchange" and a desire to reverse the natural imbalance between gods and humans. Perhaps for this reason, he works closely with The Doctor, who aims to create an artificial god and nearly succeeded during Chapter III.Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies
Pantalone is currently in charge of Snezhnaya's economic policiesAndrei and is the wealthiest of all the Harbingers.Foregone Conclusion His immense wealth is such that he paid for the Fatui's exclusive, indefinite use of the Goth Grand Hotel in Mondstadt upfront.Goth When Bao'er saw the kinds of business transactions Landa was handling on Pantalone's behalf, she warns the Traveler against trying to find out more about it.Big Business
Uncle Tian believes Pantalone's plan - to make Snezhnaya the "heart that pumps money around the world"Moment of Cessation and perhaps entirely replace Mora as a currencyCashflow Supervision - has the potential to "shake the world to its core," and fellow Harbingers Tartaglia and Wanderer both characterize him by his ambition.
Story
Little is known about Pantalone's background beyond being born into poverty and never being deemed worthy of a Vision, which fueled his resentment against the gods. Rex Lapis in particular appears to be the greatest target of Pantalone's ire, as he is the sole source of Mora and as a result, Teyvat's economy is effectively under his control.The Fond Farewell
At some point, Pantalone secretly began an experiment to test the feasibility of a new, alternate currency to Mora. He picked the secluded Fortress of Meropide as the testing ground for his experiment and had his agents introduce Credit Coupons, which soon became the Fortress' exclusive currency.Pantalone is assumed to be the mastermind behind Credit Coupons based on the narrative similarities between Moment of Cessation and Cashflow Supervision's descriptions. It is unclear how long Credit Coupons have been around, but they have been in use for a "very long time" and were used by the administrator before Wriothesley.
One of Yelan's past operations involved Pantalone as her opponent and resulted in the loss of a Fascinating Bracelet, an heirloom pair of magical communication devices, rendering the surviving bracelet useless. To make up for her loss, she infiltrated Pantalone's secret trade route and got ahold of a highly valuable robe made with a powerful beast's fur, which he had intended as a gift to the Tsaritsa. She has since taken the beast's fur to create the white mantle she currently wears.
Present Day
While Pantalone has yet to directly influence the story, his influence can be felt in various parts of the seven nations. Sometime before the Traveler arrived in Mondstadt, Pantalone booked the entire Goth Grand Hotel for the Fatui's exclusive use; while Goth was opposed to it due to the Goth family's motto of serving the people of Mondstadt, Pantalone paid for the entire intended duration upfront with an "unbelievably generous" offer.
His agent Landa can be found at Wangshu Inn,Landa who is also implied to be the Snezhnayan agent who abandoned his mission to infiltrate Mondstadt's wine industry after getting spooked by Noelle's behavior. Landa loses the invoices for a major, top-secret transaction at the start of the Big Business, causing him to enlist the Traveler's help. Bao'er, who chanced upon one of the invoice boxes and took a peek inside, advises the Traveler not to ask too many questions about "transactions of this scale," and Landa panics at the realization that an outsider knows the details of the transaction.
At "The Rusty Rudder" in Fontaine, the contents of the "The Rusty Rudder" Discarded Bill Discarded Bill in front of "Tilla" likely relates to Landa; it mentions three heavy shipments from Liyue, and states that "our friends in Liyue" are in trouble. Brek, who is mentioned in the Bill, reveals that he has made a deal with a "prominent merchant from Snezhnaya."Brek
While not directly involved in the events of Calculated Gambit, Pantalone intervenes after Yusupov's plan to assassinate Uncle Tian and establish Zhiyi as the new Tianshu fails. Having kept an eye on the proceedings, Pantalone extracted Theofan, Yusupov's subordinate and Zhiyi's co-conspirator, from Liyue off-screen before Yelan could make him her pawn. Given that Pantalone still has his eyes on Liyue, Yelan plans on using this as the basis for her next mission.

<title>Ningguang/Lore</title>
<text>Owner of the Jade Chamber in the skies above Liyue, there are stories abound about Ningguang, with her elegance and mysterious smile.As a Tianquan of the Liyue Qixing, not only does she embody law and order, she also represents fortune and wit.
Personality
The Tianquan of the Liyue Qixing. Her wealth is unsurpassed in all of Teyvat.
Ningguang is a professional businesswoman, having accumulated her wealth through hard work and perseverance. As the Tianquan, she is known for being highly meticulous in her work and holds a large amount of influence within Liyue.
She is a calculating and ruthless businesswoman guided by the sole aim of making Mora," which stems from her impoverished background. She makes use of a large intelligence network and "pawns" to gain the information she needs, and will only make use of people whose weaknesses she knows. As a result, she is disliked by those with significant influence, but nonetheless, many accept it as she adds to the overall prosperity of both the Qixing and Liyue Harbor itself.
Despite her cold, business-driven exterior, she has Liyue's best interests at heart. Under her decree in response to a case of water contamination, those who intentionally endanger public health and safety should be "shown no mercy whatsoever."Hongyi When Osial was reawakened and threatened Liyue Harbor, she put her conflict with the adepti aside and ultimately sacrificed the Jade Chamber, her life's work, to seal it away. Though per usual, she quickly had it rebuilt for her ambitions to have it spread all across the nations of Teyvat. She is also particularly fond of children, both because they give her vital intelligence and she enjoys seeing them smile.
Appearance
Gold Leaf and Pearly Jade Orchid's Evening Gown
Ningguang uses the Tall Female Characters tall female model. She has fair skin, red eyes, and straight, knee-length, white-beige hair that fades into an ashy color at the ends.
Ningguang also carries a smoking pipe with her, as seen in one of her idles.
Official Introduction
Ningguang:Jade Star in the Sky
The biggest secret in Liyue, is not a secret in of itself, but Ningguang, who herself knows all the secrets of Liyue.
Ningguang is one of the "Liyue Qixing," lethally perceptive and a sharp talker to boot. In the grand marketplace that is Liyue, Ningguang is second to none.
Everyone who meets Ningguang becomes awe-inspired by her exemplary insight and remarkable smarts. On top of that, her style is one of a kind.
She invested an astronomical amount into purchasing up huge volumes of Plaustrite, a type of rock with levitation properties. With this, she was able to build a resplendent residence in the sky above Liyue, known as the Jade Chamber.
Her chamber is much like Ningguang herself - beyond measure, above the masses, and draws attention from all.
Despite being a mogul who shakes the very foundations of business circles, she is adored by the children of Liyue like an older sister. A socialite at Yujing Terrace banquets and a connoisseur in the world of desserts, she remains Liyue's most beautiful, unsolvable enigma.
Character Stories
The "Liyue Qixing" controls all of the commerce that takes place in Liyue Harbor. Its highly-revered position is also coveted by many. Their primary ruling is to play things safe and keep a low profile.The "Tianquan" of the Qixing, Ningguang, is the only exception. She is seen as an excellent merchant in the eyes of her rivals, a friendly elder sister to kids, a socialite at the banquets of Yujing Terrace, and a connoisseur of desserts... Ningguang is the talk of the town, and everyone seems to know everything about her. However, they all seem to tell a different story of Ningguang, with great discrepancies between the versions.Still, if there's one thing all the rumors about her agree on, it's that Ningguang is someone truly extraordinary.
Up above Liyue Harbor, there is a floating palace held up by plaustrite. It is known as the "Jade Chamber," and it belongs to Ningguang.On a clear day, one can see almost all of Liyue Harbor from the decks outside the palace gates.Whenever Ningguang has important business matters to handle, she invariably comes to this floating palace. She strictly forbids anyone from accessing the premises except for her three trusted confidants. Her confidants sort through the relevant information, summarize it and hang the summaries on the wall, while Ningguang rests against the railings, enjoying the view of Liyue and quietly mulling everything over.She is certain to arrive at the perfect solution before her confidants have finished adding everything to the wall. Once she has made her decision she shreds everything and throws it out of the window, creating something of a snowstorm of paper.The handwriting on the shredded pieces of paper stands out like ink in the snow to all of the merchants in Liyue Harbor.For they know that whenever Ningguang's shredded snow falls, a huge change is about to descend on the business community.
"Ningguang knows everything," foreigners will often find the Liyue locals warning them.Loophole-hunting guilds, market-manipulating hoarders, smugglers coming ashore with their illicit goods... The Tianquan knows all the details, good, bad and ugly.Once, an alchemist from Sumeru was traveling in Liyue and unwittingly happened across the records of a certain Noctilucous Jade noctilucous jade transaction involving the Blackcliff Forge ten years prior. That night, someone from Ningguang's inner circle knocked on his window and invited him to join Ningguang in the Jade Chamber for a talk.Rumor has it that Ningguang has enchanted the Jade Chamber in such a way that allows her to eavesdrop on everyone in the city's private conversations...The truth is that Ningguang's eyes and ears are in fact the children who play on the streets in Liyue Harbor.Between them, they are aware of every confidential meeting, every private conversation, and every new visitor to the city. When Ningguang gathers them around, her promise of delicious treats proves to be an irresistible incentive, and so they tell her everything they know.Once she has finished carefully cross-referencing everything she has learned from the children against other sources, there is no secret hidden from her in Liyue Harbor.She understands the value of reciprocity more than anyone, which is why she is more than willing to invest time in mingling with the common folk.On top of that, she does actually like seeing the children smile.
Ningguang's attitude to making money is largely the same as anyone else's: you can never have enough.But money to her is more than just a sign of wealth - each Mora is a trophy of a hard-won victory.Ningguang is kind and friendly toward the common folk, but this is a side of her that none of her business associates could ever hope to see.To her, the business world is a playground, and the zero-sum games are the most exciting. Each round she wins against a wealthy merchant brings a gleeful smile to her face as they sigh and reluctantly hand over the Mora, and nothing makes her happier than seeing the guilds bow to her wishes.Every victory in this game adds to the wealth of the Liyue Qixing. Liyue Harbor prospers as a result, and this in turn creates more business opportunities and more profit for Ningguang. Every member of the Liyue Qixing is more than happy with this perfect cycle of interlocking interests.People often ask Ningguang why she is still doing business in Liyue Harbor when she has already acquired such vast wealth."Vast wealth is a wonderful thing."Ningguang patiently replies, never able to understand why people would ask such foolish questions."Adding another Mora to the pot can hardly make it any less wonderful, now, can it?"
Everyone living in Liyue Harbor has to abide by the rules. Those who do so will see their interests protected, while those who violate the rules will be punished accordingly.The rules are rooted in ancient laws set down by Morax, Liyue Harbor's divine protector, and they are absolute. Over the millennia, each Tianquan has introduced amendments to the rules to ensure they are well aligned with current societal needs.The laws are compiled and published along with a 279-page commentary, and a copy is given to each citizen of Liyue.Ningguang likes it this way: Law and order is good for business, and she understands the intricacies of the laws that forge the order better than anyone else.However, there was a certain ship captain by the name of Beidou who acted with flagrant disregard for the rules, smuggling contraband goods by leveraging her exotic cargo and exclusive business intelligence. To Ningguang, captain Beidou was the black sheep of Liyue Harbor's business community.As Tianquan, it fell to Ningguang to impose heavy fines on Beidou each time she transgressed the rules. But much to her consternation, Beidou seemed to take these fines in her stride, like water off a duck's back.Outside of the official channels, too, Ningguang tried to find ways to implore Beidou to change her ways and stop putting the Qixing in such a difficult position. In response, Beidou simply explained away her actions as "enacting justice," "helping the poor" and "keeping the sailors in their jobs." As a firm believer in the principle of live and let live, Beidou had no time for Ningguang's advice.In the end, Ningguang agreed to disagree and gave up trying to convince the stubborn Beidou to change.
Being the charming and wealthy woman that she is, Ningguang has never had a shortage of suitors.It seems that every eligible bachelor, from the young esquires of Yujing Terrace, to accomplished young businessmen, to renowned sea captains, has at some point invested substantial energy into trying to win Ningguang's affection. One rumor even has it that a wealthy businessman from the Court of Fontaine signed a major trade deal with Liyue Harbor for the sole reason that it would mean he could see Ningguang more often.Ningguang treats all her suitors with an equal measure of kindness and grace, but also keeps them at distance - enough to keep them interested but not push them away. Curiosity got the better of everyone in town, and now everyone wants to know: Who is Ningguang's lover? Little do they know, Ningguang has no love for finite things, and will certainly not be bound by something that is finite.The Jade Chamber, a floating palace above Liyue Harbor, belongs to Ningguang alone. It started out about the size of a room, but has since grown so large that in the moonlight it casts its shadow over the whole of Liyue.A portion of Ningguang's seemingly limitless wealth goes towards hiring skilled craftsmen to continue the expansion and refurbishment of the Jade Chamber, ensuring that it becomes ever more extravagant as time goes by.To Ningguang, the Jade Chamber is a symbol of her wealth and power, and a sign that her business is flourishing.Save for Mora, it is the thing Ningguang loves most in the world - because it is infinite.One day, she insists, it will cast its shadow over all the seven nations of Teyvat.
Ningguang invented a form of chess to pass the time.This chessboard not only contains to-scale reproductions of Liyue Harbor's natural and urban geography, vendors, tea houses, shops, hotels and miscellaneous stores, but it also contains six, ten and twelve-sided dice (among others.) Players use the dice to determine how far their chess pieces move, and landing on various locations will trigger different events. Victory in-game is decided by the number of counters in each player's hands.The rules can change at any time according to Ningguang's fancies, and when playing with others, she will always follow the newest rule set that she has on hand.When she's truly feeling the spirit, she will even design new rules on the spot - no one has yet beaten her at this game, and she has now reached the 32.6th edition of her rulebook.She marketed the 8th edition of the game to the general public, believing it to be the easiest to understand, but it proved to still be far too complicated for ordinary folk.Nonetheless, people flock to purchase sets on account of the beauty and intricacy of the model pieces.In truth, more people buy it for the models than for the game.</text>

<title>Naphis</title>
<text>Naphis is the current Sage of the Amurta Darshan in Sumeru Akademiya.The Trail of the God of Wisdom He was also Tighnari's master while the latter was a student at the Akademiya.Silent Seeker of Knowledge
Profile
Tighnari describes Naphis as a man of integrity who sticks to his beliefs. Additionally, Naphis' short temper is "legendary," and even the former Grand Sage Azar would give Naphis some leeway as a result.
Story
When the sages proposed their project to work with Il Dottore to turn Scaramouche into a god, Naphis was one of the two sages who opposed the plan. In response, they were imprisoned so that they would not interfere.
The sages pretended that Naphis was still active and working on the project, and they either wrote letters in Naphis's name or forced him to write letters himself, asking Tighnari to join their large project. These letters roused Tighnari's suspicions, as they lacked certain details that Tighnari had come to expect, such as dots that Naphis would routinely put on his letters to indicate the weather when he wrote them.As by a God's Side The latest letter that Tighnari received was also "uncharacteristically polite."
After repeatedly rejecting the requests by citing his duties as a Forest Watcher, Tighnari eventually offered to reconsider if Naphis would explain the project's purpose and its duration. Haravatat's sage, Khajeh, traveled to Gandharva Ville to personally invite the Forest Watcher, and in the discussion that followed, Khajeh insinuated that Tighnari's rejection damaged Naphis's reputation. However, Tighnari retorted that if the project was as important as they claimed, the short-tempered Naphis would have come to berate him in person. After seeing that they still would not answer the questions he had posed in his latest letter to Naphis, Tighnari rejected the invitation again.
Once the corrupt sages were overthrown, Naphis was freed from imprisonment.A Toast to Victory

<title>Primordial One</title>
<text>The Primordial One is the progenitor god who allegedly came to Teyvat from another world. It battled against and defeated the Seven Sovereigns seven sovereign dragon-lords who ruled over the old world. After its victory, it went on to create the heavens and earth "for the sake of humanity."
According to the scribe of Istaroth who wrote 'Before Sun and Moon', the Primordial One may be Phanes.
Profile
The Primordial One, the great sovereign, began the creation of heaven and earth for "our" sake - that of its creations which it cherished most, who would soon appear upon this earth.|A scribe of Istaroth
Story
In the time period known as "When the Doves Held Branches," the emergence of the "eternal throne of the heavens" caused the world to be remade, separating its "microcosm" from the universe. The Primordial One appeared to do battle against the Seven Sovereigns and, to that end, created Four Shades four shining shades of itself. One of the shades was Istaroth, who held dominion over time and wind. After 40 years, the Primordial One emerged victorious over the Seven Sovereigns and set about creating the heavens and earth to prepare for the advent of humanity. Humans were finally created 400 years after the Primordial One's appearance, and they made a covenant with the Primordial One.The Byakuyakoku Collection After the war, the Primordial One had many of their functions ruined and could not suppress the original order of Teyvat.
The Primordial One had a sacred plan for humanity; the scribe of Istaroth calls the year after humanity made a covenant with the Primordial One the "Year of the Ark's Opening." It was followed by the "Year of Jubilee," during which the world would provide its bounties for humanity. The only taboo was to succumb to temptation.
An unknown amount of time after the creation of humanity, the Second Who Came - the second throne of the heavens - appeared and restarted the war. The heavens and earth were torn apart, and during this period of strife, Enkanomiya dropped into the watery abyss. Despite the people's laments, the Primordial One and three of its shades did not respond; only Istaroth did not forsake them. Despite the war, the Primordial One and the one who came after created the Gnosis Gnoses to continue subduing and controlling the resentments of the world.
Two years after the creation of the Dainichi Mikoshi, people from Enkanomiya attempted to find a way back to the surface. However, they discovered that heaven's "powers of prohibition" prevented them from returning. The scribe of Istaroth believed this ban was laid down by the Primordial One and that it had prevailed over the Second Who Came, while Eboshi attributes it to the "heavenly order" but does not indicate who is behind the heavenly order. By the time of the Archon War, these powers of prohibition had weakened, allowing Orobashi to fall into Enkanomiya and conversely, bring the people of Enkanomiya back to the surface.The Three Great Martial Trials</text>

As an adeptus, Xianyun is devoted to protecting Liyue from external threats and sees Morax in high regard; when she learned of his apparent demise, she flew into a fury and threatened to destroy Liyue Harbor for their crimes, only for the Traveler to placate her by reminding her of her duties. She also has a habit of speaking formally, often addressing herself as "one". In the past, she was revered as a decisive and bold figure, while she was also known by her fellow adepti as solemn and taciturn, rarely speaking outside of activating sigils during battle.
Having lived for thousands of years, Xianyun was good friends with Guizhong and shared a similar like of mechanics; following her death in the Archon War, she modified the Guizhong Ballista to honor her memory.

Xianyun is a tall woman with long, navy hair that has light blue undertones. Her hair is tied in a high ponytail secured with a hairpin that resembles the sharpness of a crane. She has shorter eyebrows and wears red glasses. Although Xianyun seems to take the form of a human, she has taloned fingers, like the claws of a crane. Her outfit is flowy and dress-like with many white, greens, blues, and yellows, and she adorns many pendants. She wears high heels and seems to be fond of accessories.
In her crane form, she is taller than many humans and is white with blue, gold, and black plumage. Under her eyes are red markings.
Official Introduction
Xianyun: Chivalrous Shadow, Shrouded in Cloud
A new resident in the city, you say?  Oh, it's Cloud— I mean, Xianyun. Don't be fooled by her usual manner... She's  someone you can truly rely on when the going gets tough. If you ever find  yourself in trouble, just tell her — I'm sure she'd be willing to help.
Everyone has something to say about Xianyun: "That tall woman with the updone hair," "that bespectacled artisan," or perhaps "that talkative new neighbor." They all say different things, but together they paint a picture of the impression she leaves — of someone who's witty, chatty, warm-hearted, and easy to get along with.
But that's not how Xianyun sees herself. In her own eyes, she's inarticulate, reserved, and unyieldingly proud. Aside from her mastery of mechanics and knack for making all kinds of little trinkets, it's an entirely different image from how others would describe her.
Some curious individuals, seeing how her mannerisms and bearing set her apart from ordinary folk, are convinced that she's a heroine — so they go around trying to uncover her heroic backstory and whether she goes by any other names.
Ask Zhongli the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's consultant, and with a wave of his hand, he'd say: "Xianyun? We're not well acquainted, but going by her name, she sounds like a good person."
Ask Madame Ping from Yujing Terrace, and she'd nod and reply: "Xian... Oh, Xianyun? We've crossed paths, yes... She's a good person, you know. Once you've met, you'll find that your days seem to go by much more smoothly."
Ask Ganyu, and she'd nod too: "She is a heroine, but a very discreet one — hence why she's living incognito in Liyue Harbor."
Ask Shenhe, and she'd respond pensively: "Xianyun... Of course, she's a master. Whatever you do, you must not offend her."
As it turns out, such speculations are not wrong. There's far more to Xianyun than meets the eye, but those who know the full story are few indeed. If someone was to address her as "Cloud Retainer"... Well, people would know her instantly, and you'd hear a torrent of praise flow her way: "Who doesn't know Cloud Retainer? Noble, brave, loyal, and wise... A most worthy friend if ever there was one!"
So try asking Xianyun herself then: "Are you a heroine? Surely you're not... an adeptus?"
You catch the new resident just as she's working on her latest invention, her pride and joy — what she calls an "Exquisite Mini Broth Pot." She's too absorbed to take the question seriously, so she simply waves it off as a load of old nonsense and tells you not to bother her while she's busy.
As for what exactly an Exquisite Mini Broth Pot is... No one really knows, other than having been told that it brings out flavors much better than a regular soup pot. Likewise, none would know how profoundly it might impact Liyue Harbor's future gastronomic development. Suffice to say — if Xianyun says it'll be impressive, it'll be impressive alright.
Character Stories
According to the "Thrice Annotated Version of the Full Record of Pristine Pavilion," a roaming adeptus travels with the "Spirit of Eight Pure and Mighty Rose-Clouds," dancing through the air as though "riding light and striding lightning." Their lives, too, are long beyond mortal reckoning. What humans call a millennium is but time for a short rest for the adeptus in their abode. As the saying goes, "Night and day belong not in paradise."As for where the adepti dwell, the "Full Record of Pristine Pavilion" asserts that the sky is their pillow and the earth their mat, and that they may dwell in the mountains, rivers, lakes, and seas - and this indeed seems to explain the countless adeptal encounters recorded in the annals of Liyue's history. This is one school of thought.Another can be found in the classic treatise on metal and stone, "Void-Pacing Stone Catalog." While showering praise upon the weird and wonderful rock formations of Jueyun Karst, "Stone Catalog" also proffers a warning: "The peaks of Jueyun tower up to lofty heights, striving to outdo one another... each belonging to a different master - Qingyun Peak to Moon Carver, Mt. Hulao to Mountain Shaper, Mt. Aocang to Cloud Retainer. The wise climb not a mastered mountain, nor quarry its rocks."Out of a similar veneration, descriptions of what the adepti actually look like are few and far between. Based on a handful of allusions to Cloud Retainer's appearance in the historian Zichang's "Stone Tablet Compilations," as well as scattered references in ancient songs, we can know that the adepti are ever-changing in form. To take Cloud Retainer as an example, when in human form, she is said to be "of elegant countenance, dressed in purpled robes and made up like a flower in full bloom"; whereas in bestial form, she "flies with grace, soaring among the clouds and crying out to the moon."Interestingly, one particular tale recounted in "Full Record of Pristine Pavilion" gives a further idea of the sublime character of the adepti. Once upon a time, a traveler happened upon Cloud Retainer while passing through Jueyun Karst. Taking out a self-made timepiece which he proudly dubbed a "Jade Bottle Float-Type Water Clock," he sought to impress his ingenuity upon the adeptus. But to his surprise, she instead summarily pointed out the flaws of using a float-type water clock to record the passing of time. Hearing this, the traveler begged for her guidance, which he eventually received before being sent back down the mountain.Such tales are apt to make mortals lament - it is only after meeting an adeptus, free and unfettered by the material world, that one can truly realize how insignificant our lives are.
Every second of every day, Liyue Harbor bustles with throngs of people coming and going. Local businessman weighed down by sacks of gold, outlanders garbed in strange attire, shrewd and canny public servants, warm-hearted guards... People from all walks of life with all sorts of personalities mingle, to the extent that no one looks out of place.When someone new suddenly appears in a city like this, people don't bat an eyelid.This particular newcomer to Liyue Harbor is a woman who goes by the name of Xianyun. Tall and slender, she wears a pair of red-rimmed spectacles and exudes an aura that makes her stand out from the crowd.To the Fontainian merchants who sell their mechanical creations on the streets of Liyue, she's already a familiar figure. When passing by, she invariably stops to discuss mechanical design with them - and once such discussions get started, entire afternoons fly by before anyone notices. She seems well acquainted with Chef Mao and Xiangling from Wanmin Restaurant as well, and is often to be seen sitting at a table opposite Guoba, waiting for a bowl of piping hot Dragon Beard Noodles. And she's also made an impression on the waiters of both Xinyue Kiosk and Liuli Pavilion, where she sometimes dines as the guest of Mr. Zhongli from the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Granny Shan, the toy seller, remembers her too. If memory serves, she'd tell you, Xianyun's the one who often brings along a young woman with long, white hair to look at her kites and other trinkets. The young woman, whose name she now recalls is Shenhe, never seems to find anything that takes her fancy - yet Xianyun always brings her back nonetheless.Just like many other residents of Liyue Harbor, it seems that Xianyun not only has hobbies of her own, but also travels widely and has many friends.So when people see her chatting with Madame Ping by the fish pond nearby Yujing Terrace, they think nothing of it."I haven't seen much of Mountain Shaper lately. And Moon Carver still hasn't returned that Multi-Purpose Abode Cleaning Talisman I lent him, to this day...""Is that so? What might that be then, some sort of new sigil contraption you've come up with?""Yes, let me tell you all about it..."Each day, there comes a time when the lights of thousands of homes finally go out, and Liyue Harbor falls silent for a brief while. With nothing more to see before morning, Xianyun takes this opportunity to take a stroll along the narrow path that winds up Mt. Tianheng.Jagged outcrops pose little obstacle for Xianyun. With a quick jump up and a gust of wind below, she's already at the top in the blink of an eye.Gazing down upon the murky streets far below, the human known as Xianyun transforms into a crane, and with a flap of her wings lifts herself up toward the firmament.But of course, there's really nothing strange about any of this. Liyue Harbor is a city that embraces all - so it's only natural that some adepti would end up living here too.
Some of Liyue's history has simply been lost to the sands of time. The rest has either left its mark on the land in the form of ancient ruins, or - thanks to the painstaking efforts of those with adeptal affinity - made it into the annals of history. Aside from traveling to all corners of the land, those who would seek to understand Liyue's history must therefore look to the history books. Naturally, book collectors have played an important role in this process. One such individual is the great scholar of Liyue Harbor who refers to himself as "Scholar Dongming."Dongming is closely acquainted with Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's consultant Mr. Zhongli, and indeed often entreats him to help assess the authenticity of ancient texts. On one such occasion, Zhongli had a matter at hand that prevented him from attending in person, so he sent a friend in his stead.This particular friend turned out to be a tall, slender woman who wore red-rimmed spectacles and introduced herself as Xianyun. At first, Dongming assumed that she would be a person of culture and learning just like Mr. Zhongli. But upon entering, she displayed no apparent interest in the ancient texts before her, and the only thing that seemed to catch her eyes was the old mechanical lock on the door. Overcome by nerves, Dongming was for a time at a complete loss for words. As if she could sense the awkward silence hanging on the air, Xianyun took charge and began to speak. To put Dongming's nerves at ease, she reassured him that her eyesight was perfectly adequate for judging the veracity of ancient texts, and then began to talk about her glasses.It turned out that there was nothing wrong with Xianyun's eyesight, and that she didn't even need glasses to see clearly. "Glasses," she explained, "not only help people see, but can be worn as accessories too, you know! And once you've realized that... Why limit yourself to the boring colors? What's wrong with red rims anyway?""What an interesting person..." thought Dongming to himself."Besides, don't glasses put people at ease? Don't they feel more... human?" A sudden change of expression passed over Dongming's face when he heard this."I mean, more in line with the local fashion. I'm not from Liyue Harbor, after all.""Ah, that explains it then..." thought Dongming, who himself was not a local either. Hearing her say this made him feel that little bit closer to Xianyun - close enough, in fact, to steer the topic back to those ancient texts that he wanted her to assess.After looking through the texts for a moment, Xianyun frowned and exclaimed: "'Shaped like a bull, with a winged tail'... Why on earth would Fujin of the North choose to take such a form? And the part about Mountain Shaper... it's all nonsense."One way to judge the authenticity of ancient writings is to examine their contents. Given that the expert before him believed the records to be erroneous, it seemed to Dongming that this book - which he had acquired for quite the pretty price - was most probably a forgery. Collecting ancient texts is an exhausting and expensive endeavor, and requires tightening your belt from time to time in order to make ends meet. Dongming couldn't help but smile bitterly as he reflected on the misfortunes he'd faced in life. His parents and wife had already passed away, and now these books were his only escape from the sorrows of living.With a voice overflowing with emotion, he sighed: "Mortal lives are full of tribulation, while the adepti are unconstrained and carefree. I doubt I'll ever have the fortune to meet an adeptus."Gazing down through her spectacles, Xianyun looked upon the haggard-looking book-collector for a moment, before replying: "It is said that in ancient times, people who sought the path of the adepti had to pass the trials of heaven and earth, and only then might they be granted the opportunity to prove their true intentions. The tortuous path to becoming an adeptus was no less painful than the agonies of mortal life.""You're right... I've let myself get carried away."After a brief exchange, Dongming accompanied Xianyun back out of the library. Just before parting, she suddenly looked up as if she had recalled something, and said: "Despite the fact that your book isn't genuine, if I were you, I'd consider taking that old lock on your door to an antique dealer. You might just find that it's worth at least as much as that book.""And as for adeptal affinity... I wouldn't lose hope quite yet either. You have plenty of time ahead of you, so stay vital and look to the future."
The prevailing school of historical thought holds the following to be true: "Since the beginning have things existed, the heavens and earth bounded by their limits, as do the myriad rivers of the world - extending off into the four directions - all know a beginning and an end. Through the cosmos, the immortals came into being without waiting for the gods, acting without waiting for light and dark - moistening the woods and grass, soaking into metal and rock, their way of nature, their beginning unknown, their end unknowable." In simple terms - the world has its limits, and the adepti were not in fact created by the gods.Before the word "Liyue" even existed, the adepti already inhabited the mountains of this land. Among their number, some took it as their duty to protect the world and its people, while others were set on tyranny. Parts of this history have been recorded in "Full Record of Pristine Pavilion":"The drought demon ran amok, setting the naked wilderness ablaze. The people's hearts were fumigated, driving them to the brink of despair. Beset by clouds of pestilence and miasma, they were gripped with worry. Who could they turn to? Who would save them?"Upon arrival, the adeptus borrowed the wind to retain the clouds. Immediately, the clouds gathered together, and abundant rain burst forth from the heavens. Drought and plague were both driven away, and the people were saved."It was this adeptus, respectfully addressed as "Cloud Retainer" by later generations, that saved humanity from the demon of drought in their hour of need. Filled with gratitude, the people recorded her deed of great benevolence with these words.Later on, the great war broke out among the gods. The values and compassion of Morax, the God of Contracts, won him the favor of Cloud Retainer and the other adepti, and so they followed him into battle, campaigning widely across the land. Finally they prevailed, restoring peace to the land and prosperity for the people.Tales of that bygone era, with its heroes and adepti beyond number, have never failed to fascinate and impassion posterity. The towering figures of the adepti have imprinted themselves upon the very fabric of history, inspiring countless moving legends that have grown together with the people of Liyue. But when Xianyun hears humans tell their stories about the adepti, especially the parts about herself, she rarely seems to show excitement.Over the years, Jueyun Karst - which once echoed with the sound of joyful music - has become an unbearably lonely place to reside in. Nearly all her dear friends that once laughed by her side have perished in the raging fires of that war. Sometimes, the emptiness inside her is quite overwhelming. And though her companions sacrificed themselves willingly in defense of the world, she cannot help but lament their passing.But despite this, the ironclad pact that was made with Rex Lapis all those years past still holds her to her vows; the contract is a living testament to the united determination and aspirations of all the adeptal hosts. The thought of forswearing her oath and leaving has never once crossed Xianyun's mind. More than anything else, she values the ties of friendship that bind her to her companions - if it was just to uphold the wishes of her deceased adepti friends, she would never abandon Liyue at a time of need.With a mixture of regret and determination swirling through her heart, Xianyun's swelling thoughts gradually began to reside, and she listened in silence as the remainder of the human legend was told. When it was finally over, her response was simply:"A compelling story indeed."
In the days before their friendships were torn asunder, the adepti would gather from time to time and fill Jueyun Karst with the merry sound of song and music.Streetward Rambler had the best sense of melody and played the zither with great beauty, while Guizhong was a natural composer.The yakshas Bonanus and Indarias would often accompany Cloud Retainer, beating time and singing along to Streetward Rambler's melodies. Sometimes, when she was excited, Cloud Retainer would take on all kinds of different forms as she danced along with the gentle breeze.On such occasions, the creatures of the mountains and rivers would raise their heads and prick up their ears, standing transfixed as they quietly enjoyed the blissful adeptal music. Other adepti too would stop to listen with gladness in their hearts.Nowadays, a quietness has fallen upon Jueyun Karst, broken only by the whistle of the wind and the chirping of the birds.Occasionally, deep in the heart of Mt. Aocang, the sound of Cloud Retainer speaking with her disciples might be heard from the innermost recesses of her abode.Over the years, her compassion has driven her to take in many disciples. Some have tragic stories indeed, yet through years of assiduous training are no longer shrouded in melancholy, like buds that have weathered a frost emerging defiant from the melting snow.Watching them often brings her great joy. They embody the hopes that her friends once cherished, and thus through them their spirit lives on.This is precisely why she's so protective of her young disciples. At times, her overflowing desire to care for them seems to overwhelm and confuse them - but she doesn't mind.After all, the young ones have never known the agony of being separated from their friends, nor beheld the sight of blood-soaked battlefields. How could they possibly know how much they meant to her? As long as they stay safe and sound, that's all that matters.
Natural laws are mysterious and elusive, and thus do each of the adepti have their own unique methods of training.Cloud Retainer espouses the investigative study of underlying laws. Wisdom must first be sought from external sources before insights are verified internally. One must refine oneself from the outside in, aligning inner thoughts with external realities to achieve a state of unity. The purpose of investigation is to explore the principles of all things, and thereby discover the universal truths that lie within. All that is in the world, sentient or not, embodies a set of principles - and only by researching and studying these principles can one understand the laws that all things obey. This is the way of true cultivation.The fruits borne by millennia of such devotion have been great indeed, and naturally it is this wisdom that sets her apart from mortal folk. That they live such short lives seems a great pity to her, for even if it was her desire to do so, she would not have the time to teach these beings the full extent of her wisdom in its purest form. Besides, those with more limited faculties often found it difficult to comprehend such profundity, even with her guidance.But after an intense bout of thinking, something occurred to her.Though mere mortals might have great difficulty apprehending the laws of nature through experience, she herself could invest truths into ingenious devices, and thus enlighten humankind through the medium of mechanics.Firstly, given that the laws of nature are profound and enigmatic, if she could dismantle them into a myriad of smaller principles and spread this knowledge through the world, perhaps this would help humans grasp them better.Secondly, basing production on the principles of mechanics would save an inestimable amount of manpower and resources.If machines could be used to wash clothes, people would no longer have to lie there in their beds listening to the sound of clothes being laundered in the dead of night.And if people could use machines to walk, there'd no longer be such a thing as a long, arduous journey.In the present day, peace prevailed throughout Liyue, and the land no longer relied on her to deliver it from drought by the blessing of a timely rain - nowadays, the people themselves could save their fields through irrigation. The fires of war were all but extinguished, and the people were content, now longing for prosperous lives.In an age like this, upholding contracts and protecting the world was no longer simply a matter of slaying monsters and exorcizing demons. Creating mechanisms to improve people's lives was another equally valid way to achieve the same end.A mortal's life is limited, and expecting them to fully grasp the laws of nature or devote their whole lives to building an enduring legacy was simply unrealistic. But with her help... perhaps creating an earthly paradise wasn't just a pipe dream after all.Though the songs that rang through Jueyun Karst would never be heard again, the laughter that resounded in all corners of the city could still be preserved... That was something she could do, and something she yearned for from the bottom of her heart.Besides, Cloud Retainer truly is passionate about her mechanisms, to the point that she'll often forget to eat and sleep when she's working on a new one, despite how much she loves her fine cuisine.No one knows when it started, but Cloud Retainer's fascination for the study of mechanisms now grips her almost to the point of obsession - something that every single one of her disciples is all too aware of...
Legend has it that the place where an adeptus resides is known as their Jadevoid. The adeptal abodes tucked away among the peaks of Jueyun Karst are just such places.The word "Jadevoid" originates from Dwelling in the Clouds a spot among the clouds high above Qingyun Peak which overlooks the world below. This is a place that has rarely been seen by mortal eyes."Jade" refers to the foundation of this place, which was made from a single piece of Plaustrite - hence why it floats above the clouds.The true way is found in emptiness, and thus can be attained by traversing the void. Once, those who sought the path of the adepti had to pass the trials of heaven and earth. This place served as the trial of "heaven."Originally, however, the Jadevoid was not created by the adepti as a test of the spirit. Instead, it was created by Cloud Retainer as a locale for reflection and meditation. It was only later that Moon Carver and Mountain Shaper persuaded her to lend this place for the benefit of those who might come seeking the adeptal path. Hearing that Rex Lapis had given his assent and that Guizhong and Streetward Rambler both agreed as well, Cloud Retainer readily gave up the Jadevoid and had a small pavilion built upon it.Nowadays, few are able to follow the adeptal path, and the Jadevoid - almost nothing now but a legend among mortals - has returned to the care of Cloud Retainer. But today, returning to this place above the clouds, her state of mind has changed.Though the vast sea of clouds and the sight of the sun as it rises and sets are as magnificent as ever, her thoughts have begun to drift off to the lively bustle of the mortal world.Now, she yearns to live alongside the humans under the name of Xianyun."As it just so happens, I'm starting to feel hungry. How about... some of Wanmin Restaurant's delectable Crab Roe Tofu."
The adepti of Liyue were born amongst the elemental energy that courses between heaven and earth. As pure elemental beings, they are closer to the origin of ultimate truth than ordinary mortals.For Xianyun, channeling elemental power is something that can be done almost subconsciously. She requires the aid of no external focus to do so, let alone a Vision.But now that she's walking the mortal realm in human form, following human rules somehow seems oddly appropriate. To her, using a Vision as a medium to harness elemental power couldn't be easier... so why not?Xianyun certainly does not value the Vision that she wears on her arm in the same way that a mortal would. But carrying it with her led to a discovery.One time, as she was passing through Dihua Marsh, she came upon a farmer. Despite the fact that he was tall and carried a hoe, he was trembling and immobilized with fear in the face of a pair of short, feeble-looking bandits who were threatening him with daggers. Intending to help, Xianyun stepped forward - but seeing that she was a woman and slightly-built to boot, he tried to persuade her to stay out of it so she wouldn't get hurt.But when Xianyun turned to speak to him, he saw her Vision and immediately took her for a chivalrous hero instead. His tone and posture changed in the blink of an eye, and after bidding her join him in driving off the bandits, he charged straight at them. In the end, the hoe-brandishing farmer singlehandedly repelled the two thieves, with Xianyun merely knocking a dagger out of one of their hands. Yet looking at the shining Vision on her arm, the farmer kept exclaiming how much he wished he had one.Of course, the farmer didn't need a Vision - all he really needed was a little courage. But she saw the effect that the Vision had on him, and how his expression changed so completely it was almost as if he had become another person. The profound influence that an external object could exert upon a person became apparent in that instant.For a time, this left her feeling puzzled.Though it may be true that everything in this world possesses its own objective characteristics, but changing how you act towards a person because of an external object... surely that was folly in almost all cases. Known for her candor, she has always been easily moved to commend or scorn, but her judgment was always based on essence rather than appearance.When people are friendly to her, she treats them kindly back; but when they're vile, all she has for them is her contempt. This is how she is when she's Cloud Retainer, so it's how she'll be as the chivalrous hero Xianyun too."Open your eyes and take a look around - I didn't lift a finger. Since you can rely on your own skill to drive away your enemies, you should show some more confidence." Xianyun had said her piece, so with a flick of her sleeve, she was off.With heroism she cleanses the world below, and with wisdom imparts the laws of nature. To this day Xianyun walks the mortal realm still, poised and unaffected.

Altar of Mirages
Ay-Khanoum, meaning "[City of the] Moon Maiden" in the Jinn's ancient language and also known as the City of Amphitheaters (or Amphitheater City), was an ancient city in Sumeru that was jointly ruled by Nabu Malikata and King Deshret.While it can be assumed that Greater Lord Rukkhadevata was still friends with Nabu Malikata and King Deshret when Ay-Khanoum was established, there has been no direct reference to her presence in Ay-Khanoum lore. The two built the city for the Jinn.Oasis Garden's Mourning note=Chinese 鲜花与绿洲的女主人曾与沙漠的王共同为镇灵建起了「圆形剧场之城」阿伊·哈努姆，在古老镇灵的语言中乃是「月女城」之意。 tl=The Mistress of Flowers and Oases once worked with the King of the Desert to build for the Jinn the 'Amphitheater City' Ay-Khanoum, which in the Jinn's ancient language means 'Moon Maiden City.'The Shepherd and the Magic Bottle
History
Legendary Origins
According to legend, Nabu Malikata was a survivor of the Seelie race who was exiled to Teyvat after the war between the Primordial One and the Second Who Came.Amethyst Crown She wandered the barren wastelands for 72 nights and her wounds bled into streams, which then nourished gardens that gave rise to the water lilies that spawned the Jinn. At the Jinn's behest, Nabu Malikata stayed in this garden, and Padisarahs bloomed wherever she went.Ay-Khanoum's Myriad This is presumably the location where she and King Deshret established Ay-Khanoum as a city for the Jinn.Viewpoint: Viewpoint Refugee Shelters Refugee Shelters (Aaru Village)
An alternate account of Ay-Khanoum's origins is given in 'The Shepherd and the Magic Bottle', which claims that King Deshret captured the Jinn in magic bottles both out of his curiosity and to enlist their help in his goal of conquering the world. He built Ay-Khanoum to commemorate them, and they in return built his mausoleum. While the reason given for why he built Ay-Khanoum largely corroborates other accounts, it completely excludes Nabu Malikata's existence and its rendition of how King Deshret gained the Jinn's loyalty is not supported by direct accounts from Liloupar, a Jinni who directly served Nabu Malikata and King Deshret, or lore from artifact sets.
Later History
A few generations after the fall of Gurabad, Ay-Khanoum was ruled by Garshāsp,Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, Primal Obelisk Mausoleum of King Deshret, East (Underground) Mausoleum of King Deshret, East (Underground) who went on to unite several desert cities under his rule only to meet his end through unknown - but presumably violent - means.Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, Primal Obelisk Mausoleum of King Deshret, North (Underground) Mausoleum of King Deshret, North (Underground)

<title>DEF</title>
<text>RES DMG Reduction
Defense, abbreviated in-game as DEF, is a measure of how much incoming damage to a character or enemy is reduced.
The higher the defense, the less damage is taken from attacks. Defense can be modified by:
*raising your character level
*equipping artifacts or weapons that provide DEF or DEF% attributes
*certain character talents or constellations
*food items that provide a temporary defense boost when consumed
*other environmental factors such as Infusion Stones
Defense is calculated as:
\text{DEF} = \text{DEF}_\text{Character} \times (1 + \% \text{DEF Bonus}) + \text{DEF Flat Bonus}
For both characters and enemies, defense reduces incoming damage based on this formula:NGA:  防御力(等级)乘区对伤害影响公式出炉--实际上等级压制与防御力是一回事！(更新完毕)]
\text{DEF DMG Reduction}=\frac{\text{DEF}}{\text{DEF} + 5 \times \text{Level}_\text{Attacker} + 500}
The incoming damage will then be multiplied by
\text{DEF Multiplier}=1 - \text{DEF DMG Reduction}
%DEF debuffs are applied as negative %DEF Bonuses. Note that the total %DEF Bonus cannot go lower than -90%.
Enemy Defense
Characters have DEF attributes based on their base stats, levels, weapons, artifacts, and any buffs (e.g., Food).
Enemy DEF is given as:
\text{DEF}_\text{Enemy} = 5 \times \text{Level}_\text{Enemy} + 500
DEF reduces incoming damage, but its effectiveness is dependent on the attacker's level:
\text{DEF Multiplier} = \frac{\text{Level}_\text{Character} + 100}{\text{Level}_\text{Character} + \text{Level}_\text{Enemy} + 200}
*In general this means that damage received is  half (50%) of the attack power (also Incoming Damage used in the equations) at equal foe levels.
*The change in damage due to differences in level is relatively small, less than a 10% relative difference for a level difference of 20 (and far less at high levels).
For enemies with debuffed DEF:
\text{DEF Multiplier}_\text{(Debuffed)} = \frac{\text{Level}_\text{Character} + 100}
{\left[ 1 - \% \text{ DEF Reduction} \right] \left[ 1 - \% \text{ DEF Ignored} \right] (\text{Level}_\text{Enemy} + 100) + \text{Level}_\text{Character} + 100}
*The key difference of skills that decrease or reduce DEF to the skills that ignored DEF is that the former changes the actual attribute's values, increasing all damage that factors in DEF while the latter is only applicable to a specific skill/attack of the character that triggers it.
Intermediate Equations
The DEF Multiplier formula from  Defense above:
Given the expression for damage reduction as:
\text{DEF DMG Reduction} = \frac{\text{DEF}_\text{Enemy}}{\text{DEF}_\text{Enemy} + 5 \times \text{Level}_\text{Character} + 500}
Plug in enemy defense to produce the damage reduction for enemies:
\begin{align}
\text{DEF DMG Reduction}
&= \frac{\left[ 5 \times \text{Level}_\text{Enemy} + 500 \right]}
{\left[5 \times \text{Level}_\text{Enemy} + 500\right] + 5 \times \text{Level}_\text{Character} + 500}
\\
&= \frac{\text{Level}_\text{Enemy} + 100}
{\text{Level}_\text{Enemy} + 100 + \text{Level}_\text{Character} + 100}
\\&= \frac{\text{Level}_\text{Enemy} + 100}
{\text{Level}_\text{Enemy} + \text{Level}_\text{Character} + 200}
\end{align}
Subtract the damage reduction from 1 to get a defense multiplier for incoming damage.
\begin{align}
\text{DEF Multiplier}
&= 1 - \text{DEF DMG Reduction}
\\
&= 1 - \left[ \frac{\text{Level}_\text{Enemy} + 100}
{\text{Level}_\text{Enemy} + \text{Level}_\text{Character} + 200} \right]
\\
&= \frac{\text{Level}_\text{Character} + 100}
{\text{Level}_\text{Enemy} + \text{Level}_\text{Character} + 200}
\end{align}
To consider debuffs that decrease an enemy's defense, multiply the enemy defense accordingly.
\begin{align}
\text{DEF}_\text{Enemy (Debuffed)}
&= (1 - \% \text{ DEF Reduction}) \times \text{DEF}_\text{Enemy}
\\
\text{DEF Multiplier}_\text{Enemy (Debuffed)} &= \frac{\text{Level}_\text{Character} + 100}
{\left[ 1 - \% \text{ DEF Reduction} \right] (\text{Level}_\text{Enemy} + 100) + \text{Level}_\text{Character} + 100}

<title>Phase Gate</title>
<text>Phase Gates are ruin devices used for transportation that are primarily found on Seirai Island and Watatsumi Island.
Types
Normal Phase Gate
When two Phase Gates face each other, an energy route is established between them. When the player enters an active Phase Gate, they will be turned into a ball of what looks like Electro, then travel to the linked Gate. Routes between linked Phase Gates never touch the ground, and they are also often not straight, even if a straight path is available. Some Phase Gate routes run through an Electroculus.
Most Phase Gates can be rotated by interacting with them; Elemental Sight can be used to check the way the opposite door is facing. A linked Phase Gate will emit light and sound, while an unlinked one does not.
Enkanomiya Phase Gate
A variant of Phase Gates can be found in Enkanomiya. Instead of a gate, they look like circular, transparent blue-green portals. Players who enter these Phase Gates take on the appearance of a glowing blue orb.
Enkanomiya Phase Gates are similar to the standard ones, save that they cannot be rotated and therefore are always active, and are often one-way, leading to areas where there may not be another Phase Gate present to go back to the starting point.
Sumeru Phase Gate
A portal that seems to be another Phase Gate variant can be found in the domain during the Archon Quest 'Silent Seeker of Knowledge'. It appears as a circular, transparent yellow-green portal. Upon entering it, the player is turned into a glowing yellow-green orb with small wings but cannot cancel the travel, unlike other Phase Gates.
Fontaine Phase Gate
A phase gate variant similar to the Sumeru Phase Gates, except that they are light blue and require interaction to use them.
??? Phase Gate
Another phase gate variant can be found in ???. These function much like the Fontaine ones, but look similar to Abyss portals. They are narrow fissures in reality which open wide when the player draws near.

<title>Aquabus</title>
<text>The Aquabus is a water vehicle found in Fontaine. It operates on a dedicated transportation system called an aquarail, providing scenic tours and efficient transportation for its occupants.
If there is no aquabus at the station, players can select the "Wait for the aquabus..." dialogue option next to the bench to call for one.
According to Augustus Lovelace, aquabuses feature Melusine guides who provide commentary on the local scenery, and remarks that riding an aquabus is a "sublime experience."Augustus Lovelace

Lore
The Aquabus system is a system designed in cooperation with Callas and both the Court of Fontaine and Fontaine Research Institute. Callas believed that the system would help improve relations between them and Poisson, though the costs were very expensive. This resulted in a feud between him and another Spina di Rosula member, Romeuf, who believed that the costs would be better off improving the town. Matters were made worse when Callas' wife, Clementine, also supported his decision, resulting in Romeuf breaking off with a large amount of members on particularly bad terms against Callas and his family. After Clementine died, Callas started funding the construction of the Aquabus system.Shimmering Memories Three lines were created; the Callas, Clementine and Navia lines, servicing the Court of Fontaine to the Fontaine Research Institute, Romaritime Harbor and Erinnyes.
When the Fontaine Research Institute suffered an explosion due to Edwin Eastinghouse's research on Arkhium (though he denies being responsible for the accident), it also destroyed the Callas Line in the process; the line has not been rebuilt as of yet.
After the Prophecy of Fontaine was dealt with, Romeuf and his faction attempt to get revenge on Navia by planning to destroy the support columns of the Clementine Line to create an avalanche that would bury Poisson in rubble. The plot was foiled by the Traveler and Navia, after which she decides to start reconstruction on the Callas Line and adding more stops to the other lines.

<title>Chiori/Lore</title>
<text>Personality
Chiori is a famous fashion designer from Inazuma who is currently running Chioriya Boutique in Fontaine and is one of the Komaniya Express's regular customers. She left Inazuma when the Vision Hunt Decree Vision Hunt and Sakoku Decree had been enacted and had not returned since. Chiori usually speaks in a blunt, straightforward manner, which can take some time to get used to. Her methods of resolving disputes can be considered radical, as she does not like wasting her time on explanations. She is also particularly mindful with her fabric, not wanting them to get damaged, and even scolding Lyney on one occasion when his outfit got damaged.
After an encounter while delivering a package to her, Chiori made Kirara's current outfit, Whirling Bloom, after being displeased with her appearance. This resulted in her store becoming more known as people inquired about the outfit. She also tailored the outfits worn by Lyney, Lynette, and Navia, as well as the accessories for Charlotte's Kamera, Monsieur Verite. Chiori is very popular among the people of Fontaine, ranging from the upper classes to even muscle men who treat her with respect and gifts; anyone who disrespects her are promptly thrown out of her store. While people are willing to pay for her clothes, Chiori is not particularly driven by wealth, rather being more interested in increasing the reputation of her name and store.The Crack of Muskets Breaking the Silence (Quest)
Chiori is good friends with Chevreuse, having maintained a vital network and offers information to her which she appreciates. It is also implied that Chiori does not like competition in her industry, as she quickly drives malignant competitors out of business.
Appearance
'(To be added.)'
Official Introduction
Chiori: Couturiere of Countless Colors
Chiori's really good with her hands! Whenever I try on a new outfit, she always does up my hair too — it's all part of the package, she says! Hehe, I just love it when she brushes my fur...
On the busiest street in Fontaine's Quartier Lyonnais lies a clothing store called "Chioriya Boutique." Though it may seem unassumingly small, you'll notice that passersby often stop to peer in. People say that its boss Chiori hails from Inazuma, and that she is as direct as a bolt of lightning. They know what happens to those who insist on interfering with her business, having witnessed the fallout with their own eyes. Not only do such meddlers invariably end up tasting the bitterness of defeat, but some of them — for the very first time in their lives — learn what it feels like to be thrown backside-first into the gutter... literally.
What sort of background and upbringing gives a foreign fashion designer the confidence to act so boldly? This is the question that local journalists ask one another when they hear or witness such spectacles, their eyes wide with amazement. They're constantly on the hunt for anecdotes that might shed some light on her past, some even having traveled all the way to Inazuma to secretly interview her friends, family, and former tailoring mentor...
Obstinate, headstrong, and disobedient from a young age, even daring to forgo honorifics when addressing her elders... overall, not a particularly positive picture.
Chiori's parents alone would let out a smile, saying that she just has "a unique way of thinking" and is "single-mindedly devoted to the pursuit of her dreams."
"Miss Chiori, may I ask... How did you manage to achieve such success? And what are the secrets to designing such wonderful clothes?"
Sitting opposite, Chiori began to put away her needle and thread as she stared coldly back at this journalist masquerading as a customer.
"I make whatever I wish to, however I wish to. How about you then — are you planning to buy anything or not?"

<title>Cyno/Lore</title>
<text>The General Mahamatra of the Akademiya, leader of all the Matras. He has a unique sense of humor that never fails to leave a deep impression.
Personality
The General Mahamatra in charge of supervising the researchers of the Akademiya. It is said that when he gets down to work, the General Mahamatra is even more sufficient than the "Great Vayuvyastra" made by the Kshahrewar.
Cyno is a curt, stoic and generally emotionless young man with a ruthlessness and vicious approach to his duty as a matra that make him intimidating and unapproachable. He cares little for niceties or social gatherings and is known throughout Sumeru for his ruthless efficiency at upholding the law.
Despite his young age, Cyno holds the position of General Matra Mahamatra in the Akademiya and takes his position seriously. Cyno is extremely dedicated to upholding the Akademiya's rules and punishing any transgressions, to such an extent that even the Sumeru Akademiya Academic Progression sages of the Akademiya (ostensibly his superiors) are wary of him. Notoriously, Cyno will relentlessly pursue any individuals that try to flee his judgment, even across the desert - a trait that, in combination with his prowess as a hunter and warrior, makes escaping from Cyno nigh impossible. Due to this, Cyno's name is infamous within Sumeru and many scholars fear the prospect of ever meeting him, despite the fact that he only handles cases of significant interest.
Notably, Cyno idolizes "justice" above all; though this predominantly manifests in his pursuit of suspected criminals, Cyno will also protect criminals from any danger that arises during their escape attempts until they can, in his view, be properly judged by the Akademiya. Although he is often viewed by the Akademiya's scholars as an obstacle or a threat to their research (complaints to which Cyno is indifferent), Cyno views his role as that of a protector, preventing seekers of knowledge from being led astray and becoming dangers to both themselves and the world. However his being blessed with an Electro Vision suggests that his view of justice is closer to a desire to preserve the law, which he holds as eternal, rather than being interested in justice in and of itself.
Despite his seriousness in academics and work-related matters, Cyno is fairly relaxed outside of Akademiya duties, being an avid fan of Genius Invokation TCG. He shows concern for Collei, frequently visiting her when he has the time to ensure that she's doing well, as well as harboring friendships with Tighnari, Alhaitham and Kaveh. Despite his intentions to put people at ease, he maintains his emotionless, harsh attitude in most situations, even outside of work. Aware that his reputation as General Mahamatra often intimidates those around him (even his fellow Matras), Cyno tells jokes as a way to help people relax around him, though his jokes are generally unfunny and his long-winded attempts to explain them even more so.
Cyno also confesses to a fondness for the desert from which he hails, finding himself most at ease there and often taking nighttime strolls there to help himself relax.
Appearance
Heart of the Scales
Cyno uses the Medium Male Characters medium male model. He has tan skin, red-orange eyes, and medium-length gray hair.
Manga
Cyno is depicted wearing a large, black cape including a hood with what looks like jackal ears sewn on it. His cape seems to take inspiration from Northern Africa, showing some similarities with the large capes worn in the Sahara in order to avoid the heat, and to stay protected during sandstorms.
Official Introduction
Cyno: The law is just, and there is no escape for the guilty
Many researchers at the Akademiya fear that the General Mahamatra will interfere with their research. However, it seems that they are worrying about nothing. Most of them do not produce results worthy of his visit.
If an Akademiya researcher is required to have a formal meeting with the General Mahamatra, Cyno, it usually does not bode well.
In general, a personal visit from Cyno implies that these researchers are perpetrators of serious academic offences: plagiarism, bribery, academic fraud, false declarations, misappropriation of funds, malicious competition, appropriation of someone else's dissertations, and more... The only thing left for these researchers to do is to follow the General Mahamatra and face disciplinary action.
But these researchers will not accept their sentence so easily.
Most of them try to bribe the General Mahamatra with Mora. These "wealthy people" will then be punished even more severely. Meanwhile, some choose to use force in an irrational act of recalcitrance... After paying the price for their defiance, they are subjected to a harsher sentence.
Others, at their wits' end, even feign madness, claiming memory loss or pleading insanity in a desperate attempt to escape punishment.
However, General Mahamatra Cyno has unfailing patience when dealing with these people. In his own words:
"As a Matra, it is one of my duties to help people 'remember' the mistakes they have made."
Character Stories
As the leader of all Matra, General Mahamatra Cyno is well known to everyone in the Akademiya.His duties are to arrest those who violate the Akademiya's rules and regulations, terminate illegal studies, and uphold discipline of the Akademiya. Nevertheless, researchers feel that this General Mahamatra does nothing but undermine academic progress and prohibit scientific research. Some even claim that he is "cutting off the path to knowledge" and can be seen as a dire threat to any researcher eager to seek knowledge...Over time, researchers have come to shrink away from Cyno in silence whenever they so much as see him, wanting to have nothing to do with him.But the General Mahamatra is hardly bothered by such things.If this exaggerated public image can really deter some researchers, that will in no way be an inconvenience for his work.Plus, in the words of that Forest Watcher friend of his,"The research conducted by most researchers is nowhere significant enough to result in a talk with a Matra."
Wisdom can bring enlightenment to scholars, but can also lead to utter arrogance.In the history of the Akademiya, many researchers have used their "wisdom" to commit crimes.For example, in order to test the limit of the Specters' body inflation, one Amurta researcher adopted an illegal catalyst and created a mega-sized Specter, which later exploded during the experiment and leveled the entire research center. Then, there was a researcher from Spantamad who had aimed to test a Ruin Guard's ability to cultivate fields, but lost control of the modified machine, resulting in the ruin of many farmlands and grave injuries for several farmers. There have also been numerous criminal cases concerning academic fraud and the abuse of intelligence for personal gain...Such researchers, who do not abide by the law and pose dangers to others, will all be pursued and judged by the Matra led by Cyno.When they stand before the Matra, these researchers will almost always spare no effort to justify themselves. Their reasons have included but are not limited to suddenly cut funds, the Akademiya's favoritism towards other researchers, the results of their work being stolen... Some may even accuse the Matra of stopping them from completing their research out of jealousy of their talents.Cyno's response to such sophistry is always to stay silent and press forward in subduing all those garrulous criminals and sending them to trial.Those who violate the rules can always come up with a million excuses. However, only one ending awaits them.
The name of the General Mahamatra has traveled well beyond the Akademiya's walls.According to a Forest Watcher in the Avidya Forest, he once caught a glimpse of this General Mahamatra quietly traveling through the woods in the middle of the night. A person living on the outskirts of Apam Woods can still clearly remember how a white-haired teenager asked them for a bowl of water, before venturing deep into the forest alone with just a traveling pack on his back. Adventurers resting in Sobek Oasis claim to have given directions to Cyno, though the area he was heading to had been packed with monsters. Even the proudest mercenaries and Treasure Hoarders in the Great Red Sand dare not make things difficult for the General Mahamatra, having learned this lesson well from the example of a mercenary group that was annihilated in the desert for sheltering wanted researchers.However, for those criminals who have fallen into the hands of Cyno, their reverence for the General Mahamatra usually comes from another aspect of his character.When escaping from the Akademiya, criminals tend to flee in an extreme panic, and can sometimes stray into perilous places. Yet, instead of letting them suffer the consequences, Cyno will come to their rescue without hesitation, just so that he can bring them back to the Akademiya to face their proper punishment.Once, a criminal who had crossed the Great Red Sand with Cyno asked him about the point of doing all this. Cyno replied,"Only the law can judge you, and my role here is to bring you to face the scales."After being released from prison, the researcher, who had been a Vahumana graduate, turned their adventures returning to the Akademiya into a novel titled "The Goon," which remains a bestseller in the Akademiya. The researcher was even invited by Vahumana to give a lecture, during which they went into great detail about the portrayal of "justice" in the book.If you ask Cyno, however, he would say that certain parts of the book were heavily exaggerated. In truth, they did not encounter any monsters created by the descendants of King Deshret, nor did they stray into a living labyrinth at the bottom of the desert or survive a sandstorm in the folds of a humongous sandworm.Nevertheless, Cyno did appreciate the candidness with which the author described their own crimes, and would like to remind them to not commit such crimes ever again.
In the Akademiya, the mere mention of the Matra's office can make any researcher's heart seize up.Apart from the renowned "evil deeds" of the Matra, what disturbs them even more is how creepy, dry laughter can be heard from the office whenever Cyno walks in...Researchers firmly believe that this must be the Matra's way of expressing smug satisfaction at the sight of Cyno passing judgment on some hapless researcher.But only the Matra know that the laughter is a response to Cyno's unique sense of humor."I once worked on a case where the researcher involved was under great pressure because his paper had been rejected multiple times at the review stage. He eventually rammed it through by successfully bribing the members of his review committee. However, the data in that paper was so wrong that it didn't even take long to be exposed as academic fraud. When I went to arrest this researcher, he asked me 'what have I done wrong?'..."After a pause, Cyno continued,"I answered, 'Your paper.'"Seeing the Matra all sit there in silence, Cyno seemed to be worried that they did not get the joke, so he went on to explain it with a serious expression,"You see, the interesting part of this story lies in how, when he asked me what he had done wrong, he expected me to say that his fault lay with his bribing of the committee due to academic pressure, yet I told him that his error was in not reaching the correct conclusions in his paper. The clever part about this joke is that I changed the subject that was being discussed..."After he finished explaining, the Matra all exchanged looks before letting out a few dry, strangled laughs in concert...The awkward laughter lent a strange sense of human warmth then to the often somber and solemn Matra office.However, to prevent such an awkward situation from ever happening again, the Matra gradually came to a consensus that after Cyno finishes telling a joke, everyone in the room must force out a laugh or two in response so that he will not start explaining it.On the other hand, any Matra who attempts to imitate Cyno's style will be harshly punished by the others through extreme means such as confiscating their canteen meal tickets.After all, one Cyno is enough for the whole division.
Cyno has always believed that the Matra are not the enemies of those who seek knowledge.Cyrus (Sumeru) Cyrus, a scholar who tutored Cyno before, once told him that without the Akademiya's laws, "wisdom" will soon turn into "calamity."These floating scraps of out-of-control "wisdom" are like bait on a sea of ignorance, luring innocent knowledge seekers into the abyss.They will make researchers far too arrogant and reckless, to the point where they may even attempt to tamper with life and death due to their lack of respect for human life. Eventually, they shall cause irreparable damage to the world.The sages keep introducing new rules and regulations precisely to ensure that the knowledge seekers of the Akademiya will not be misled and go astray because of such bait.The Matra who hunt down those who violate the law and judge them according to those same laws are in fact the "guardians" of all those who seek knowledge in the Akademiya.However, in the eyes of researchers, they are but a bunch of "demolishers" who constantly, violently cut off their paths to knowledge."Dumb humanoid Fungi," "Mr. You-Can't-Do-This," "Paper Shredders"... These are all nicknames they have come up with for the Matra.Among them, the most notorious one is "the Akademiya's Sumpter Beasts," a name coined by a Haravatat researcher.When they first heard of this nickname, most of the Matra were rather enraged, reckoning that the researchers thought too little of their hard work.On the contrary, Cyno noted that he actually fancied it quite a bit."We Matra are indeed Sumpter Beasts who walk the Akademiya's halls, carrying the rules and regulations on our backs.""When exercising our rights, each of us must always keep that weight in mind."After pondering the matter for a while, this General Mahamatra added,"Plus, we could stand to be more like Sumpter Beasts in avoiding pointless arguments and focusing on, ahem, getting to our desired destination."
When the Akademiya was first established, its researchers wielded their boundless imagination and innovation to the fullest with the abundant resources available at their beck and call.They had reshaped terrain, controlled the weather, recreated ancient relics... But when the knowledge of the earth could no longer satisfy their insatiable curiosity, some researchers turned their focus to the starry skies, whereas some others attempted to tamper with life and death.However, these kinds of knowledge were not things they should or could have touched upon.To prevent researchers from being devastated by their own knowledge, the sages laid out six cardinal sins.They held that all the crimes in this world derive from these six sins.The first is to interfere with human evolution;The second is to tamper with life and death;The third is to delve beyond the universe;The fourth is to investigate the origin of words;The fifth is to revere gods without acts of devotion;The sixth is to attempt the forbidden and fear none.Since then, the sages have been introducing new rules and regulations according to these six deadly sins while amending and revising old ones. The Matra enforce the laws, and the researchers perform their roles accordingly as well.In this way, everything in the Akademiya functions in a desirable manner, and the Akademiya and its researchers have been marching forward with thriving clarity of wisdom ever since.As time has passed, the six ancient sins seem to have been forgotten by most, and ambitious people have been on the move since...However, for Cyno, the current General Mahamatra, what he ought to do has not changed.He will, according to the six ancient deadly sins, justly judge all the lawbreakers.Even sages shall not be exempt.
This deck box, which contains Cyno's Genius Invokation TCG deck, is his favorite physical possession.The exterior of this deck box is wrapped with multiple layers of high-quality leather, and every seam has been carefully handled. As long as the rope fixed on the leather remains tightly tied, the entire deck box will be completely sealed, and not even a drop of water can get through. The interior is padded with silk, which can minimize the bending of card corners. According to the shop owner, the silk used was all imported from Liyue and made from top-quality Silk Flowers. This deck box even comes with a tough leather strap, so the buyer can easily affix the box to any part of their body. The surface of the deck box is even engraved with the Genius Invokation TCG emblem and the name of one who purchased it.Cyno has put his strongest deck in this box. He believes that as long as he gets to duel with this deck, he will be nothing short of invincible.Of course, the next thing to do is to find a couple players who are willing to play against him.Hmm... Would that Forest Watcher be available at the moment?
When it comes to how Cyno got his Vision, many versions of the story can be found circulating in the Akademiya.Some say that he was once instructed to arrest a researcher who had been studying methods of making counterfeit Visions. The researcher had previously bought a masterless Vision for research, which then became Cyno's Vision. Some believe that Cyno is actually a descendant of King Deshret. They say that he grew up in a temple located in the Great Red Sand and was raised by a nameless Hermanubis priest who cultivated Cyno's will and strength before, when he was ready, bestowing upon him a Vision and requiring him to cross the desert all by himself to arrive at the Akademiya and enact Hermanubis' will. Of course, according to some conspiracy theories, Cyno's Vision is closely connected with certain forbidden technologies hidden within the Akademiya. Otherwise, how could this member of the desert ilk earn a spot in the Akademiya?No one dares to check any of the stories' authenticity with Cyno in person, and Cyno himself cannot be bothered to waste energy on these ridiculous rumors.The truth is that the way he obtained his Vision was rather simple.It was the day before he was about to become the new General Mahamatra. As per usual, after finishing his work as a Matra, Cyno went to the library to read books relating to the Akademiya's rules and regulations. He can still well remember that the book he was reading that day mainly talked about the six cardinal sins that the sages had decided on, which they held to be the origins of all crimes and thus served as the foundation for all the modern rules and regulations of the Akademiya. While he was reading the chapter on the sin of divulging secrets without a hint of fear, he failed to fathom some chunks of the content depicted in the book, so he closed his eyes and ruminated. The moment he opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was a Vision, laid nicely on the page.Cyno looked at the Vision and fell into contemplation. He first confirmed that there was no existing rule that prohibited someone from being granted a Vision. Then he went over several academic cases with Visions involved and ensured that this Vision was not some malicious trap. He went on to ponder the challenges he might encounter after becoming the General Mahamatra and how this Vision might help in these future trials... After carefully weighing up the pros and cons, Cyno finally accepted this gift from the gods earnestly.By then, the morning light was already shining through the windows. Cyno left the library with the Vision and his as-yet-unfinished read in hand before heading over to the location where he was to be inaugurated as the General Mahamatra.If all went well, in half an hour, he would become the Akademiya's new General Mahamatra.He was about to be entrusted with the sacred power to judge those who had erred, and this Vision would ensure that this sacred privilege could be exercised as intended.

After learning about Collei's affliction, which was exacerbated by an injection of ancient gods' remains (archon residue) given to her by the Fatui, Jean brought Lisa a relevant document about the Fatui's experiments, hoping she would be able to read the ancient language it was written in. While Lisa was unable to read the document herself, she knew someone at Sumeru Akademiya who did and sent a letter to her former teacher regarding the matter.
Cyno was sent to handle the matter and arrived in Mondstadt three days later, just as Fatui personnel led by Barnabas arrived to retrieve their documents and apprehend the person who killed their diplomats - Collei. Cyno brought Amber and Collei to Starsnatch Cliff to seal the gods' remains away and successfully put them into a dormant state. Tired from the ordeal, Cyno returned to the City of Mondstadt first and was not present when Barnabas attacked Amber and Collei.
After Barnabas was defeated and Collei was absolved of her involvement in the Black Fire Incident thanks to Diluc and Kaeya's plan, Collei decided to return to Sumeru with Cyno.</text>

<title>Chenyu Vale</title>
<text>Stub
Areas
Lithic Oath in Chenyu
The gentle breezes carry the fragrance of tea all across the mountains of Liyue, filling the air with the savory scent once more."Tea grows upon the rocks, where jade springs endlessly flow." The faint perfume and ancient song of jade drift together along the rivers past Qiaoying Village to the bustling port of Yilong Wharf. Just what adventures and fortune await, concealed among the fog-robed peaks of the south...?
Lore
Chenyu Vale refers to the area surrounding Mt. Yaojun, a sacred mountain which was once under the dominion of an adeptus known as the "Herblord," who once took the form of a young lady.Echoes of an Offering Soulscent Bloom: This one left behind the ambiguous name of "Herblord," as well as many foggy and fragmented legends. [...]There is even a story that goes like this-The young lady grasped at the hooded hat on the ground as she struggled ashore, placing it on her head haphazardly.Jade Leaf: But though the young lady who was master of this mountain complained, she too could imagine the tea's fragrance. While Chenyu Vale is described as having "many mountains [and] rivers" in Flowing Rings' description, Jade Leaf's description only mentions a single river; regardless, this water source is likely the reason why Chenyu Vale's climate is "relatively humid" compared to the Hills of Barsom.An Artist Adrift (Part 1)
According to legend, the Herblord's friend, another adeptus, planted a particular tea tree here. When the tree was still a sapling, someone tied a jade ornament to it; later on, when the Herblord returned to the mountains in a changed form, she no longer had the fingers to untie this ornament, while her friend had sunk to the bottom of the ocean. Many years after, the tree's branches were grafted to the "other side of the river" by people who lived on the mountain, and its tea leaves became famous in Liyue Harbor and other areas. However, this type of tea tree is said to only grow well in Chenyu Vale because it remembers the promise between two friends.Jade Leaf
There is another legend that claims the Herblord's adeptal form turned into the branches of an ancient tea tree, and one in which the Herblord ascended to an "adeptal mountain."Soulscent Bloom These legends currently cannot be verified, although the former appears to be a more fantastical interpretation of the tea tree legend mentioned in the previous paragraph.
In reality, during the Archon War, an unnamed god ruled over Chenyu Vale and was at war with Morax; the Herblord and the other adeptus, known as Fujin, served under the unnamed god. The war was incredibly bloody, as the Bishui River was crimson red from all the fighting between the two cations. The people who lived there at the time did not participate in the war, so to protect them, Fujin and the Herblord created sanctuaries to protect them from the god's other followers. Near the end of the war, in a final attempt to defeat Morax, the god planned to flood the Bishui River, which would also destroy the vale. Seeing this, the Herblord and Fujin rebelled against their god. The Herblord fought the god, Lingyuan evacuated the people and Fujin threw the Votive Rainjade into the waters. The Herblord was greatly diminished after fighting the god, while Fujin lost many of her powers and "sank into the sea," losing much of her strength.
Various interpretations and stories exist regarding a famous Chenyu Vale legend involving a slab of jade located on a sacred mountain, which was capable of summoning "sweet rains" and became coveted by demons, after which it was thrown into the river and sank underwaterFlowing Rings - which likely led to the name "Chenyu," meaning "Jade-Sinking." In other tales, the Herblord split the jade into several ornaments and hid them in various places, including underwater, in the mountains, and in shrines. These ornaments are believed to carry the blessings from a pact with a deity, and a particular priest inherited a jade loop which had been passed down from their ancestors who had made that pact; artisans at Yilong Port also make jade ornaments to this day because of these legends.Symbol of Felicitation
In the present, Lingyuan, yearning for the days of old, began to tamper with the vale's spirit lines, causing the soil and water to become "tainted", contaminating Qiaoying Village's tea supply with an inferior quality. This also caused miasma to erupt across several places around the vale, which was an unintended consequence. Fujin, learning of the taint, discovers the Traveler when they stepped foot in the vale and asks them to assist in restoring the balance. During the investigation, they discover Lingyuan responsible for the damage and manage to bring her back to her senses after a short fight. Fujin then expends more of her power to undo the damage dealt, though she is unable to revert any remaining miasma in the vale. This causes her to revert to her original form as a carp and unable to return to her human form, but the vale is saved.Chenyu's Blessings of Sunken Jade</text>

<text>Alhaitham's Home is the residence of Alhaitham and his roommate Kaveh. The interior cannot be entered normally and is only accessible during the following quests:
Pride and Prejudice;Suspicions Aroused;Past Mementos display=bulletIt consists of a central living room, a study in the room to the right, a hallway to the left containing a painting, a broom, and a red floor cushion, and a hallway to the right of the previous hallway containing a shelf with books. These hallways lead to two inaccessible doors.
Lore
Alhaitham's home was originally a research center provided to him and Kaveh by the Sumeru Akademiya Akademiya for their joint research. It was allocated to the two after it fell into disuse due to the lack of a united vision between the researchers, as well as due to a lack of manpower, and eventually converted into a proper home after Kaveh forfeited his rights to the property. After having sold his home and all his possessions to fund the second construction of The Palace of Alcazarzaray, Kaveh went bankrupt and would spend his time drinking in Lambad's Tavern, where he eventually reunited with Alhaitham and was invited to live with him on the condition that he pay rent. Kaveh would also take on fulfilling all the domestic duties, such as tidying up, after suggesting that he could help out around the house while staying there. Despite essentially being Kaveh's landlord, Alhaitham only ever refers to Kaveh as his "roommate."
The house's decoration is a point of contention: Kaveh finds Alhaitham's choice in furniture ugly and wants to be consulted before Alhaitham purchases more.Pride and Prejudice Kaveh has his own room, which he goes into on the rare occasion that Alhaitham has guests. To avoid being discovered living with him, he also avoids answering the door if Alhaitham is not home.Competition on the Sands</text>

<title>Fatui</title>
<text>The Fatui are a delegation of diplomats from the Zapolyarny Palace of Snezhnaya. There is also a military detachment led by the Eleven Fatui Harbingers and the Tsaritsa herself. They are one of the main antagonistic factions in 'Genshin Impact' and the main antagonists in the official supplementary manga.
A singular member of the Fatui is called a Fatuus.
Description
The Fatui are a powerful military force in terms of power and numbers, making it the strongest of all the seven nations. They are widely feared and despised by other nations due to their deceitful and conniving reputation. The organization is composed of members performing a variety of roles, including combatants, bureaucrats, politicians, and merchants.
Hailing from the frozen lands of Snezhnaya, the Fatui are publicly seen as a political department of the nation that represents the goodwill of the Tsaritsa and manages foreign affairs with all six other nations. However, despite how they initially present themselves, the citizens and governments of those nations are often already aware of their true colors, and treat both their diplomats and individual members of the organization with distrust.
They often use underhanded methods to establish their power and influence in another nation, and as a whole are willing to go to extremes to further the Tsaritsa's vision for a "perfect world." Deception, extortion,Bookworm Swordsman and human experimentation are but some of the tactics they employ to bolster their own strength.
Despite their loyalty to their empress, most of the Fatui grunts themselves are unaware of the Tsaritsa's true plans. The Harbingers are likely some of the few among the ranks who are truly aware of the Tsaritsa's true intentions, as they are the ones assisting her in collecting Gnoses.
The Fatui are divided into divisions, each of which is headed by one of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers. Each Harbinger operates with a different modus operandi which also influences how their underlings act.Shuumatsuban Operations There is often a lack of thorough communication between fellow Harbingers,The Fond FarewellDefender of Childhood Dreams Harbingers and their subordinates, as well as between different divisions of Fatui operatives.Equivalent Exchange However, some members of the Fatui are quite loyal to their leading Harbinger, to the point of being willing to seek revenge for their sake.New Beginning
The Fatui come from a variety of backgrounds: some were taken in at the House of the Hearth orphanage,The Replacement's SecretLost in a Foreign Land: Seeking others choose to join their ranks, while others, like Childe, can be enlisted by their parents. They also do not hesitate to help financially and diplomatically strategic allies in order to interfere in foreign policy.Foregone Conclusion
They receive certain advantages in exchange for their services, such as supplies, salaries, or powerful weapons;Fatui Skirmisher - Electrohammer Vanguard in exchange for this, however, they choose neither the destination to which they are sent, nor the superiors to whom they obey.Tales of Winter
Many of the Fatui NPCs in the game are everyday workers who are oblivious to their superiors' true intentions, but are nevertheless very loyal to the Tsaritsa and Snezhnaya. Members have differing opinions on being stationed in other nations, ranging from intense homesicknessVlad to having developed fondness for their new home.Andrei
In Mondstadt
So far, the Fatui's tactic to increase their influence in Mondstadt has been to incite or take advantage of disturbances to offer their assistance in a way that puts the Knights of Favonius in an awkward position. For example, they provoked Ursa the Drake into attacking the city so that Il Dottore could defeat it (later attempting a similar setup during Ludi Harpastum),Manga, Chapter 12:  and one of their diplomats pressured Jean to allow them to kill Dvalin after the Stormterror attack.Shadow Over Mondstadt Later during the Stormterror conflict, agents stole the Holy Lyre der Himmel, though it was soon retrieved. A delegation of diplomats is currently residing in the Goth Grand Hotel, though they are apparently under lockdown. During Eula's Aphros Delos Chapter Story Quest, it is revealed that some members were colluding with Schubert Schubert Lawrence to invade Mondstadt, promising to help him establish the Lawrence Clan as the rulers of the city once again, though this plot was quickly foiled by the Knights of Favonius.Through the Motions, to the Heart
The Fatui were presumably the ones who gave Crepus his Delusion, and were the ones who lured Ursa the Drake to his carriage, eventually leading to his death. They are also competing with Diluc to find a vial that contains the Barbatos Anemo Archon's breath, which was stolen six months prior to the events of the game from one of the Temples of the Four Winds. Due to the amount of counterfeits that have flooded the market since, both the Fatui and Diluc have yet to find the real one, though Diluc has been purchasing every counterfeit he can find just in case.State of the Holy Lyre der Himmel
The Fatui also have plans involving the heart of the deceased Abyssal dragon, Durin, in Dragonspine, though the Traveler ends up interfering when they arrive.The Festering Fang
In Liyue
The Fatui used to have some kind of diplomatic immunity in Liyue Harbor (and an embassy),Gentry De'an and have been investing in the local economy through the Northland Bank, though the Liyue Qixing are wary of them. The Northland Bank is an arm of the Fatui "with some exceptions"Endless Smoke despite their receptionist Ekaterina denying this, being a national bank founded in Snezhnaya that has opened a branch in Liyue Harbor. The Harbingers are important clients of the bank, and the Fatui's Debt Collection division, of which Fatui Pyro Agents are a part, seem to assist the bank in tracking down debtors.YouTube:   The Fatui also have ties to Wangsheng Funeral Parlor,An Organization Known as Wangsheng the exact nature of which are unclear.
Shortly after The Chasm (Subregion) The Chasm shut down due to a series of mysterious incidents, the Harbinger Signora had negotiated with the Liyue Qixing Qixing to allow the Fatui's Ninth Company to enter the underground mines to cleanse the Dark Mud mysterious sludge in the mines with an experimental device. The Fatui would investigate The Chasm, while the Millelith would deliver supplies and orders. However, the device exploded and the Fatui became scattered across the mines. The Ninth Company, a group of 64 soldiers, suffered such immense casualties from this that half of the men are assumed dead or missing including the company captain, forcing Staff Sergeant Anton to assume command, although not everyone has listened to him.A Company Vanishing Into the Deep
Fatui soldiers assisted Tartaglia Childe after he summoned the Osial Overlord of the Vortex in order to draw out Rex Lapis, fighting against the Traveler, Keqing, and the Millelith on the Jade Chamber. Since this was effectively abetting a plot to destroy Liyue Harbor, this caused the remaining Fatui in Liyue to be looked down upon with suspicion and the Ninth Company in the Chasm was promptly abandoned and declared criminals by the Millelith, having lost all communication with the surface and desperately running low on rations. However, some of the company are still alive, such as Anton and his remaining followers. Katarina is another notable Fatuus, having remained in the underground mines to search for her brother, who was separated from her. The Fatui have turned to bartering with Treasure Hoarders in the region for food.Undetected Infiltration
While relations have soured since Childe's actions, the Fatui still has a delegation in Liyue and is still interested in the nation's politics - upon learning that Uncle Tian had wanted to step down from the Liyue Qixing, they colluded with one of his disciples, Zhiyi, to assassinate and replace him so they could have influence over the Liyue Qixing. Fortunately, this plot was foiled by Yelan, who had been investigating Zhiyi, although the Harbinger Pantalone (who was monitoring Liyue's situation) managed to minimize the Qixing's advantage over the Fatui.
In Inazuma
The Fatui were the masterminds behind the Vision Hunt Decree in Inazuma, and fanned the flames of conflict on both sides of the Inazuman civil war. They colluded with the Tenryou Commission Tenryou and Kanjou Commissions to feed the Raiden Shogun false informationBlind Loyalty, Reckless Courage and gather materials for their Delusion Factory respectively, secretly distributed Delusions among the Watatsumi Army Watatsumi resistance forces, and planted spies throughout the country in various efforts to destabilize both Watatsumi and the Inazuma Shogunate Shogunate and render them vulnerable to Fatui influence.Delusion (Quest)Clean House They caused the Tatarasuna Mystery Tatarasuna Incident by sabotaging the Mikage Furnace as part of Pierro's plan to lay the groundwork for a future endeavor in Inazuma; while unconfirmed, it was most likely the prelude to the Vision Hunt Decree plot. They were also responsible for the Tatarigami outbreak on Yashiori Island, as Nathan a Fatui infiltrator convinced members of the Watatsumi Army to destroy the wards on Yashiori Island.Interactable: Narukami Pillar Waterlogged Note Waterlogged Note
After the Vision Hunt Decree was abolished and the civil war ended, the bulk of the Fatui's forces retreated, although a few groups remained behind for various reasons. The First Lord Harbinger Pierro dispatched Naval Warrant Officer Borenka to cover up the Fatui's involvement in the Yashiori Island disaster by recovering the infiltrator's report and extracting any Inazuman recruits to be silenced. However, he and his group were defeated by the Traveler and Shizuru, who retrieved the report for Watatsumi. Some subordinates of Signora have stayed behind to avenge her, seeking to disrupt the peace treaty between the Shogunate and Watatsumi, though they were unsuccessful. Another group from the House of the Hearth, led by Efim Snezhevich, also planned to reignite the civil war by poisoning Watatsumi Island; Efim believes this would raise the prestige of their patron, the Harbinger The Knave Arlecchino, though it is later revealed that he had broken off with unsuspecting subordinates to advance the The Knave (Previous) previous Knave's directives. This plan was disrupted by the defection of Lyudochka Snezhevna, and the Shuumatsuban is working to root out Efim's remaining associates.Momoyo
In Sumeru
Fatui involvement in Sumeru has largely been from the Harbinger Il Dottore's projects. They collaborated with the sages of Sumeru Akademiya to replace Lesser Lord Kusanali with a new god of wisdom. Dottore was aware that the sages did not acknowledge Kusanali as a successor to Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, and he was intrigued by the possibility of creating an artificial god. He set up an experiment to turn the Harbinger Scaramouche into Sumeru's new god using the Electro Gnosis (previously acquired by Scaramouche). They successfully turned Scaramouche into the god Joururi Workshop Shouki no Kami, the Prodigal, though he was soon defeated and Lesser Lord Kusanali was restored as the deity of Sumeru. In the aftermath, Dottore recovered the Electro and Dendro Gnoses for the Tsaritsa via a deal with Lesser Lord Kusanali: the deletion of all his other Segments, as well as an exchange of information.
Following these events, Lesser Lord Kusanali took Scaramouche under her wing. Upon learning the truth and scale of Dottore's machinations, he broke off from the Fatui and attempted to erase himself from Irminsul, though this attempt was unsuccessful. Upon restoring his memories via a backup that Kusanali had made to resist tampering, Scaramouche abandoned his name and the Fatui. As an effect of tampering with Irminsul, Scaramouche's seat would remain unoccupied for hundreds of years, with any further effects being unknown.As Though Morning Dew
Another of Il Dottore's projects involves weaponizing dreams and The Withering, and many of Dottore's subordinates in Dharma Forest have been tasked with aiding the project. Dottore is particularly interested in the Aranara, who possess the power to manipulate dreams, and his subordinates have been ordered to catch the Aranara for study. With the help of an Trofin Snezhevich infiltrator they have been trapping children from Vimara Village to lure out the Aranara, though such measures have consistently failed due to the Aranara's innate properties.The Bad Guy in Vimara Village A related team led by Oleg set up research camps across the forest using machines with the goal of extracting energy from Withering Zones. However, the machines were not actually intended for that use and they had been tricked into using them by Kasim, a con artist. Oleg's team was eventually arrested by the Corps of Thirty and their machines were disabled.The Foolish Fatuus
The Fatui are also active throughout the Great Red Sand. They have been collaborating with Thutmose, an The Eremites Eremite faction, in order to explore the ruins of King Deshret's civilization.The Secret of Al-Ahmar Separately, the Fatui Desert Expedition Investigation Team was sent to the Desert of Hadramaveth to study the desert tribesRejoice With Me, for What Was Lost Is Now Found and explore the The Orchard of Pairidaeza Eternal Oasis, striking a deal with the Tanit tribe for aid. However, they were betrayed by Matriarch Babel, putting their efforts at a standstill. When Babel ordered Jeht to eliminate the Traveler, she refused the order, prompting her to lay a trap with the Fatui to eliminate her. The Fatui successfully caught her, but were terrified of her tenacity. Likewise, she told the Traveler of her "betrayal", hoping that one of them would kill the other, but the plan was foiled and the two destroyed the team.
Some Fatui were also sent to the Girdle of the Sands for reasons unknown, with one officer, Markozov, seeking the Pari for unknown reasons related to knowledge, though Sosi believes that they were coveting the power of the gods.
In Fontaine
The Harbinger Arlecchino is a native of Fontaine, and as such she is concerned by a prophecy claiming that the people of Fontaine will one day dissolve into the water of the Primordial Sea, leaving only the The Seven Archon Focalors to weep. Arlecchino and her operatives under the House of the Hearth were in Fontaine for the supposed reason of stopping the prophecy from occurring. Tartaglia was also sent to Fontaine to assist the Northland Bank branch there, but was (falsely) accused of being the perpetrator behind a series of mysterious disappearances. Though he was proven innocent, the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale still declared him guilty, and he was sentenced to the Fortress of Meropide. Arlecchino sent several of her agents to infiltrate Meropide and gather intel, while she decided to investigate the Hydro Archon.
The Fatui are also involved in other operations throughout the nation. Henri was hired by the Fatui to collect parts from the Fontaine Research Institute for them, and was misled into extracting the Mysterious Core cores of seven water quality monitor devices, being told they were polluting the water. The Traveler helped him, not knowing he was hired by the Fatui. However, Henri's "Boss" boss was ultimately captured by Hunter and Turner, who revealed Henri had been tricked.Still Mouthwatering!
The 34th Independent Investigative Squad was deployed to Mont Esus East, and took over several hydrological monitoring stations once used by the Fontaine Research Institute, claiming the Maison Gestion gave them permission. In truth, they were only pretending to work, as the squad (including its captain Malinovskyi) simply wanted to slack off but were being monitored by the deputy captain, Shumilov, who they did not like. In the end they were chased off by the Traveler, who was helping the researcher Broglie.In Search of Lost Time
Following an explosion at the Fontaine Research Institute, Arlecchino sent several of her Fatui Operatives to investigate the matter.
Upon learning of some ancient ruins near Poisson, Arlecchino had sent a group out to explore it, but they soon learned of the Poisson disaster and devoted their resources to helping the people out, such as performing headcounts and monitoring water levels. When Lyney, Lynette and Freminet learned of the Traveler and Neuvillette's plan to "trap" Furina so she could admit her secrets, Lyney had the Fatui help him in replicating a larger-scale version of the trick he initially performed at the Opera Epiclese, who created a false house and made a tunnel from Poisson all the way to the opera house. They also assisted Freminet in finding a missing stone slate that the Traveler, Neuvillette and Navia had come upon while investigating the ruins.
When the prophecy passed, Neuvillette gave Arlecchino the Hydro Gnosis as a "diplomatic gift", as both Arlecchino and Tartaglia provided invaluable assistance to the people of Fontaine and that he wanted to dispose of it after Skirk's urging.
The forces of another Harbinger (likely Sandrone) worked with a civilian named Jenck to steal Sir Arthur to help him take over The Steambird in return for finding Mosso Lombroso's inheritance and research in machine intelligence. The collaboration ended when Jenck destroyed "Curve", a lie-detecting Clockwork Meka created by Lombroso, and most of his research to avoid capture, so the Harbinger had him punished accordingly by breaking his mind and ripping his tongue out, leaving a letter apologizing to the Traveler, Paimon and Talochard. The Harbinger's subordinates were ordered to recover Curve's remains afterwards before anyone could act.Questioning Melusine and Answering Machine
In Natlan
During Varka's expedition with the veteran members of the Knights of Favonius, they ran into Il Capitano and his subordinates, who were heading to Natlan. They eventually arrived, and Neuvillette states that Il Capitano had "thrown himself" into the nation's endless "wars".

<text>quote = The great general of Watatsumi Island's forces. He has gained respect and prestige, but always shows himself to be a humble leader.He is deeply trusted by his subordinates and is someone with whom you can share your feelings without shame.
Personality
quote = The great general of Watatsumi Island's forces. He is deeply trusted by his subordinates.
Gorou, like all of Watatsumi Island's inhabitants, is a loyal supporter of Sangonomiya Kokomi. Kokomi trusts him to lead the Watatsumi Army as its primary general, being sincere, determined and courageous. He has a strong sense of camaraderie and gets along well with all of the soldiers under his command, who in turn share the same sentiment and speak to him if any issues arise, including new recruits. Kaedehara Kazuha Kazuha describes Gorou as a person who says what is on his mind, uninhibited by others' feelings.
In the heat of battle, Kokomi remarks that Gorou tends to have a habit of letting the adrenaline rush to his head, often requiring someone to keep him in check when he heads to the battlefield. While he considers himself to be mostly inexperienced due to his age, he tries his best to help out with any problems that may arise. He is comfortable speaking with others apart from Yae Miko, as the kitsune enjoys messing with him that he instinctively hides from her if given the chance.
Gorou has dog blood in his veins and shares several of their traits, including the ability to mostly understand what they are saying from a single bark. His ears also twitch accordingly depending on what emotion is evoked. If he is particularly happy, his tail begins wagging, something that he considers embarrassing, yet is unable to control and is sometimes oblivious to. He also wishes to be taller and more muscular so that his soldiers can identify him easily on the battlefield.
He is fond of sweets due to their rarity in military life, but avoids onions as they make his eyes tear up. This once lead to him crying in front of his men, greatly embarrassing him. He is also fond of mountaineering as it builds strength and camaraderie, expressing a desire to scale Liyue's mountains if he gets the chance to travel there.
Appearance
Panoply of a Hundred Hunts
Gorou uses the Medium Male Characters medium male model. He has fair skin, light orange-brown hair with a white section, and teal blue eyes. He has erect pointy ears that are white inside and a bushy tail with a white underside.
Official Introduction
Gorou: A trusted general who will guide his loyal men into any battle
Kindness and loyalty are the representation of virtue. Without a doubt, my friend Gorou is a virtuous general.
A loyal and brave general of Watatsumi island. Born with a beast-like fighting intuition and tenacious will, he can find a way to victory even in the most critical moments.
He leads the Watatsumi troops, who have far fewer military resources compared to the Shogunate. Gorou strives to ensure that the inhabitants of this island will live in safety and peace.
Outsiders may not be able to imagine that Gorou, someone who faced thousands of enemies on the battlefield, is actually very affable and gets along with all his subordinates.
In Gorou's eyes, the people around him are not only his brave soldiers, they are also his beloved companions. They are like treasure to be cared for and protected. The land that sustains us, the comrades who support us, the faith that encourages us to move forward... These are the most precious things for Gorou, to whom he devotes his loyalty and courage.
Within Gorou exists a soul as vast and reliable as the earth.
Character Stories
Gorou is the great general of Watatsumi Island's military, and he is deeply loved by his subordinates.During the period of the Vision Hunt Decree, Gorou led the forces of Watatsumi against the Inazuma Shogunate Shogun's Army, and successfully held the line against them.The troops call him the "ever-victorious pointy-eared general," a nickname that has also seen broad use among Shogunate warriors.In private, however, Gorou puts on no airs and is a straightforward person, which has led him to be regarded by all as the man with the plan.But even such an exemplary general must have his fair share of troubles...
Gorou was once an ordinary Watatsumi soldier.During a certain special operation, Gorou's unit, Gorgasia II, faced an unprecedented crisis.Their captain had been felled by a stray arrow, and the survivors were surrounded deep in the mountains.To continue their mission, to ask for reinforcements, to open negotiations with the enemy... Countless choices lay before them, but the mountain was silent.Leaderless and without any supplies, the unit was on its last legs. With their morale flagging, thoughts of surrender shrouded many minds.At this critical moment, Gorou stood up. He rejected negotiation and surrender, and instead proposed a bold plan.They would not hide any longer. Instead, he would lead the larger part of the platoon in a feigned attack to buy the others a chance to call for reinforcements. Once those reinforcements arrived, they could perform a pincer attack together.When asked what they should do if they failed, Gorou replied:"If the enemy surrounds us any further, our options will be even more limited. The way I see it, we still have a chance, so we've got to give it all we've got.""I'll take responsibility if the plan fails."After holding the line for several days without rest, the exhausted Gorou and his companions were finally relieved by a force led by Sangonomiya Kokomi herself.After that, he was promoted to serve as the captain of Gorgasia II, and from there he would work his way up to the rank of General.
In the eyes of the men, Gorou is a strict but humble general.He is straightforward and easy-going, and he treats his subordinates like his own family, sharing weal and woe with them.Sangonomiya Kokomi once told Gorou that material, supplies, and salaries were the three most important things to an army.From that day on, he would personally explain weapon maintenance to his subordinates. Every time the granaries were opened, he would supervise the process strictly to prevent any unlawful deductions.And as General Gorou, he will always lead from the front.The sight of him charging at the tip of the spear is like a rallying banner, encouraging the troops behind him to continue advancing.These are all reasons why the troops greatly respect him. As with Kokomi, Gorou greatly treasures the lives of his troops, but by contrast, values his own quite little.Some who understand little of the thought process behind this occasionally joke that Gorou is a "kid" who doesn't seem like a general at all.But to the soldiers of Watatsumi Island, this kid is the best general they could ask for.
Gorou is valiant and decisive, often leading inferior forces to victory over superior opposition.However, he does have a shortcoming of his own - a sometimes unstable temper.That is to say that the blood sometimes rushes to his head at the height of a battle.War is cruel, and Gorou does indeed lack experience compared to veterans who have been scrapping it out on battlefields for decades.Fortunately, he learns fast and is currently trying to make up for his various small failings.Sangonomiya Kokomi often provides her various commanders with directives, but how they are used is up to the skill of the commander in question.For his part, Gorou is always able to execute the courses of action that best suit the present situation from the directives he has been given.Gorou believes that over time, he will come to internalize the concepts behind them. Perhaps then, he can take the field with even more confidence than before.
At Yae Miko's request, Gorou has taken up a certain extra "job" at Yae Publishing House.With the end of the Vision Hunt Decree, and the successful negotiations between Watatsumi Island and the Shogunate, relations between the two sides are beginning to warm.Gorou has also visited Narukami Island quite a few times to check out the changes, buy a few popular books, and go to Yae Publishing House to complete the task he agreed to help with.Yae Miko set up an anonymous column for Gorou in the "That's Life" magazine. Here, readers will write about the things that trouble them and send them to Yae Publishing House, upon which Gorou will give them some suggestions.Yae Publishing House will take special care to redact any personal information revealed on the part of the write-ins or Gorou's replies, and will replace real names with pseudonyms.According to Yae Miko, she chose him because she'd heard that he often listened to his subordinates when they chatted about personal matters.The column proved to be very popular indeed, but for whatever reason, every time an editor delivers the royalties to Gorou, they might sheepishly ask:"Ah, speaking of which, Gorou, have you heard of Ms. Hina?""I've heard that she's a rather popular columnist, and a recent one, too. Is something the matter?""Oh, no, no... It's nothing..."
Just as the troops don't exactly tell Gorou everything happening in their lives, Gorou, too, has some troubles that are difficult to share.For example, how his tail fur starts to get dull and look haggard after being exposed to the elements for too long, and how he'd love to tend to it - if he could only spare the time out in the field.Or how he sometimes feels a bit inferior about his slight physique when bathing together with his subordinates.Or about how encountering inscrutable women like Yae Miko sends him into defense mode instantly, rendering him unable to properly interact with them...In trying to maintain a respectable image, Gorou refrains from telling his soldiers about such troubles.And while they have been able to guess at his troubles to some extent, the Watatsumi soldiers often just play along and pretend that they don't notice.As such, his worries just kept piling up, until the Traveler arrived, thus granting the Watatsumi general, ever good at banishing the worries of others, someone who could help relieve him of his own woes.
Of Gorou's various hobbies, "mountaineering" is likely up there in the top three.Sweating it out while climbing a mountain with companions before admiring the beauty all around you helps to train both the mind and body and is a great camaraderie-builder.To better enjoy this hobby of his, Gorou bought a set of mountaineering gear from a traveling merchant.The set is not particularly pricey, but it is both sturdy and durable and has seen Gorou through many dangerous ascents.Just as he maintains his weapons well, Gorou has also kept this set of gear in tip-top shape. There is little doubt that it will accompany him through many future journeys as well.
There was a time when Gorou ascribed responsibility for victory or loss in battle entirely to himself."If only I became a little stronger, perhaps I'd be able to turn the tide."It was in this spirit that Gorou trained his archery day and night, hoping to rely on his strength to lead his comrades to victory.But after some time on the battlefield, Gorou saw powerful warriors being isolated and captured alive, while weak troops in inferior positions could rout their enemies through unity.That was when Gorou realized that a single person's battlefield capabilities are limited.Getting stronger is important, naturally, but uniting the troops to fight as one is even more crucial.A troop can only be unbeatable if they are strong together.Having realized this, Gorou no longer pursued the apex of excellence in archery, but instead invested time and effort in those around him, helping everyone improve together.Thinking back on it, this may have opened the door for Gorou to obtain his Vision.

<title>Eleven Fatui Harbingers</title>
<text>The Eleven Fatui Harbingers are the executive heads of the Fatui and the Tsaritsa's lieutenants who have been given absolute authority.Ending Note They also have had their abilities boosted with the Delusions granted to them by the Tsaritsa, which makes them far more powerful than normal allogenes. Each Harbinger leads their own division within the Fatui.
Currently, the Harbingers' collective mission is to obtain the other six Gnosis Gnoses.Others Fatui An organization from Snezhnaya that is loyal to the Tsaritsa. Its Harbingers are on the hunt for the Gnoses.
Overview
The Eleven Harbingers are the most powerful and highest-ranking members of the Fatui, and are also all wealthy, politically influential members of Snezhnayan society. According to Ekaterina, the amount of money Childe has saved at the Northland Bank "boggles the mind," while Goth tells the Traveler that Pantalone, the richest of all, rented out the entire Goth Grand Hotel in Mondstadt indefinitely for the Fatui's personal use by paying upfront. Due to Childe's status as a Harbinger, the Fatui diplomats handling the aftermath of his summoning of Osial were unable to resolve the situation by handing him over to the Liyue Qixing;The Fond Farewell the Northland Bank instead had to pay reparations.Endless Smoke
Upon becoming a Harbinger, a person is given a new name and codename, which can be inherited from their previous holder.Momoyo They are also assigned a ranking number, which is based both on the individual's power and their overall contribution to the Tsaritsa's cause in comparison to the other members. The top-ranked Harbingers, up to No. 3 (Columbina), possess powers which can rival the gods.A Toast to Victory The Harbingers can also partake in a "wild" and "frenzied" banquet, to which Pierro may personally invite prospective recruits.The Kabukimono's Finale Further information about this banquet is not known.
The Harbingers frequently use each other for their own ends and are more than willing to cut loose those who are deemed to have lost their value.The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call The Harbingers' disparate methodologies and motivations lead to frequent internal squabbling, as well as a mutual lack of respect or trust among a number of its members. For example, during Signora's funeral - the first gathering of the Harbingers in a long while - Pantalone criticizes Pulcinella for declaring "merely" half a day of mourning, leading Arlecchino to rebuke them both by suggesting that they are cowards compared to Signora. Childe and Sandrone remark on the bickering as inappropriate and laughable, respectively, while Il Capitano acknowledges Signora's death as a "pity" but precedes it by saying that "[her] methods tarnished her honor." Pierro ultimately ends their banter by telling the Harbingers to put an end to their "foolish theatrics."YouTube:  Not all Harbingers have negative relationships with each other: Pierro genuinely mourns Signora's passing, while Pantalone and The Doctor work closely for a currently unknown purpose.
Most rank-and-file Fatui members hold respect for their commanding Fatui Harbinger, expressing a deep attachment to the Harbinger they are under to the point of taking matters into their own hands to curry favor from them, acting in what they believe are in their Harbinger's best interests, or exacting revenge if the Harbinger they were the direct subordinates of was killed.The Strongest Opponent! The Biggest Crisis!Where the Dandelions Find Rest Those who were loyal to a Harbinger that was replaced may also continue to pursue said Harbinger's goals.

<title>Bokuso Box</title>
<text>The Bokuso Box is an event gadget obtained from the Three Realms Gateway Offering event, which is based on Enkanomiya.
When equipped, the Bokuso Box allows the Traveler to approach Illusory Platforms and collect Tokoyo Legume. When used, the Bokuso Box expends 6 energy to disperse the darkness around enemies and Aphotium Ore, to activate Guiding Light, and to rotate Illusory Stairways.
As the Traveler endeavors into darker areas of the event map, the Corrosion Intensity also grows stronger. When the Bokuso Box's Corrosion Resistance is lower than the area's Corrosion Intensity, it periodically loses energy and causes Corrosion to accumulate. (See The Encroaching Dark.)
Bokuso Box's energy can be replenished by collecting Light Conches or Coral Butterfly, or by recuperating at the Statue of the Vassals.
Tutorial
text1  = In lightless Enkanomiya, some foes will be defended by the darkness and cannot be defeated by ordinary means. You can expend a certain amount of energy to use the Bokuso Box and disperse this aegis of unlight and deal a certain amount of DMG to such opponents.
text2  = While exploring Enkanomiya, you can expend a certain amount of energy to use the Bokuso Box and disperse the darkness clinging to challenge arenas, treasure chests, and harvestable items. As the Bokuso Box is upgraded, it will become able to disperse more intense darkness.
Statue of the Vassals
At the statue, Light Realm Sigils can be used to upgrade its level to increase its energy capacity and Corrosion Resistance. The Bokuso Box also needs to reach a certain level to unlock certain Corrupted Waypoints.

<title>Sucrose/Lore</title>
<text>An alchemist with an insatiable curiosity towards the world and everything in it. Attached to the Knights of Favonius as an assistant to Albedo, her area of focus is "bio-alchemy."She strives to enrich the world by transforming living things with the power of alchemy.Granted, the products of her research sometimes prove to be more weird than wonderful - but on the whole, she has made monumental contributions to the field of bio-alchemy.
Personality
An alchemist filled with curiosity about all things. She researches bio-alchemy.
Sucrose loves experimenting and spends most of her time researching on bio-alchemy, stating that she likes to discover the secrets of life. Her research often yields numerous results that she often labels every unique variable as a result of its own, regardless of how useful said result may be. She spends an immense amount of time researching that she finds herself quickly bored whenever she takes a break.
Due to spending most of her time researching and experimenting, Sucrose is a recluse. She has trouble talking with others, as she frequently worries about unintentionally offending them. Lisa remarks that she is hopeless when talking to people, as she is very timid and easily frightened, especially by people of imposing status, such as Jean and Eula. However, she does not share the same issue when talking about bio-alchemy or Albedo. She reveres Albedo to the point that she considers him to be a true gentleman and maintains an excessively formal manner towards him, despite both of them being at a similar age.
Despite her meek nature, Sucrose is also compassionate and humble. In spite of her social anxiety, she sympathizes very well with those who are equally or even more shy and awkward than herself. She's also supportive of other people's academic pursuits, as shown by her support for Collei's studies and Klee's Jumpy Dumpty creations.Windblume's Breath/Story She's also close to her fellow alchemists Timaeus and Albedo, supporting and respecting them in research and other aspects of their life. However, she will not shy away from honest criticism of her friends, such as Timaeus' research or Albedo's bad habits, even if doing so scares her.
Appearance
Germinating Wind
Sucrose uses the Medium Female Characters medium female model. She has fair skin, amber eyes, and light green hair that is chin-length except for a section at the back of her head that goes down to her hips. She wears a pair of dark brown round spectacles. Sucrose also has pointed light green animal ears which she tries to hide with her hair; the animal they correspond to is unknown and it is the subject of some of Sucrose's investigations.
Character Stories
Sucrose may be the assistant of the genius alchemist Albedo, but they could not be more different in research direction.As opposed to studying the essence of alchemy and the ability to create new life, she is far more interested in using alchemy to modify existing life, all the better to add variety and color to this world.Despite her youth, she has already achieved some brilliant results. For example, she has been able to increase the nectar output of Sweet Flowers by 70% by irrigating them with a special potion. She has also developed a special spray that allows Sunsettias to maintain their freshness for a whole month after being plucked from the branch.Even people who were initially suspicious of her research inclinations have come to acknowledge her exceptional talents in the field of alchemy after seeing such results.However, she merely considers these to be incidental steps on the path to a successful experiment, rather than the success itself. Her true aim is much more ambitious than this.It's a secret, and is also her little dream.
Bio-alchemy explores numerous lines of inquiry, all of which stem from Sucrose's questions about living things in the world. These questions, in turn, are born out of her insatiable curiosity, a faculty that is far more developed in her than it is in most.For instance, Sucrose's curiosity was once drawn to the sweet flower, accepted by most people as simply being a source of sugar.She wondered: Although sweetness is clearly the most readily identifiable feature of this plant, should that be grounds for limiting its application as we have tended to do? Does it not merit further study?So, after a careful study of the various features of sweet flowers, she devised thirty-something distinct rearing plans along with numerous control groups to account for temperature and other environmental conditions.And yet, her experiment still underestimated just how many variations were possible. After the experiment began, Sucrose found herself with more questions rather than fewer, and the novel discoveries that her experiment yielded gave her inspiration for further research.Sucrose is incapable of leaving a question unattended to - it makes her restless, even guilty, to ignore it. Spurred on by this quirk of her temperament, her rearing plans grew in number to almost three hundred.The result was a whole new series of sweet flower strains: Some with thrice the number of flowers, some with heads five or six times the normal size that could even float in the wind, and some even producing a sweet-tasting fruit.Months of experimentation later, Sucrose had finally answered every last one of her questions pertaining to sweet flowers. As she finished writing up her research notes, she let out a long sigh of relief.Though she was physically and mentally exhausted, the sight of stack after stack of her bio-alchemical research volumes stretching around three walls of the room gave her a deep sense of joy and satisfaction.
To the people around her, Sucrose comes across as a quiet, introverted alchemist with little interest in the lives of others.In fact, the truth is quite the opposite: Sucrose is fascinated by absolutely everything that exists in the world. The only thing is, she finds the discipline of social interaction to be far more difficult to master than that of alchemy.In alchemy, the process of trial-and-error coupled with a determination to get to the truth is sufficient to bring you to your answer eventually. But with interpersonal relationships, there is the added complication of having to factor in manners, moods, and other unquantifiable variables. To make things worse, there seems to be no room for an approach that relies heavily on making errors.Hence, Sucrose decided to avoid such variables at all costs and stick to her familiar methods in satisfying her curiosity.For instance, Sucrose had always been curious about whether she and Cat's Tail bartender Diona, both of whom have animal ears, had any shared ancestry.In fact, this was not a private matter, and most people would simply ask the question. But Sucrose was concerned that it would be a sensitive topic - she, for one, did not like people drawing attention to her ears.So, she resorted to the method she knew best: observation.For one whole month, Diona constantly had an unnerving sense that someone was secretly watching her. She assumed that one of the tavern patrons was stalking her, and was none too happy about it."Similar genome, but ultimately different ancestry. Cat connection merits further study. Note: Unable to obtain bone sample thus far."This is the conclusion that Sucrose has jotted down in her notebook based on her findings so far.Bio-alchemy aside, Sucrose made one further discovery from this episode.That is to say, judging by the pair of cat-ear spectacles she made for herself after the event, it would appear that she has finally come to comprehend a certain uniquely feline variety of cuteness. She is too shy to wear them in public, however, and only puts them on when alone in her room.
Once every three days, Sucrose ventures out into the real world at dusk. To her, these excursions are rare and momentous events.One by one, she visits the butcher's, the Adventurers' Guild, and the Springvale hunters, looking for a material of a very specific kind."H-Hi... Sorry, I... I'd like, um, the freshest, best-quality b-bones you've got... Yep, the ones with the blood and meat still on."People found her behavior utterly unusual at first, but once they had gotten used to it, they were eager to oblige, even putting the rarest bones aside for her in advance.This was a major bonus for her. Not only was she able to acquire an ample supply of the usual chicken and boar bones, but she also got her hands on a complete lizard skeleton and even a chunk of hilichurl leg bone still bearing fresh blood.Her eyes would light up with excitement at the sight of these strange and rare bones. She would thank Katheryne of the Adventurers' Guild profusely, bowing to her over and over.As well as going some way towards satisfying Sucrose's curiosity, she also found new inspiration from piecing new bones togetherMore importantly, collecting skeletons was her hobby, and she was crazy about it.One day, Sucrose happened to overhear a mother attempting to discipline her child:"If you don't do as your told, the scary old lady with the cloth sack over her back will come to your door, go into your room, pick out every bone from your body, and take them away!"Sucrose's curiosity compelled her to investigate further. It turned out that this was nothing more than a ghost story used by mothers to shock their children into compliance, and that it had existed long before Sucrose was even born.She breathed a sigh of relief when she found out the truth.Soon after this, people noticed that Sucrose had switched her cloth sack for a leather one. Perhaps she did this just because she was shy. Or perhaps it was to avoid arousing suspicion...
As an assistant, Sucrose does everything she can to support Albedo, and even though his alchemical inquiries tend more towards the abstruse, she finds herself learning a lot every time.After an experiment lasting five straight days and nights came to its end, Albedo noticed that Sucrose was on the brink of collapsing from exhaustion, and organized a mandatory seven-day vacation for her.Sucrose began her holiday determined to take a proper rest and regain her energy, but from the moment that she woke up on day one she struggled to adjust to the vacation lifestyle.First things first, let's get some breakfast: fried eggs, sausages, and a cup of coffee. Nothing new to report there. All of these were foods and beverages that she had previously researched, after all.Next, she thought, how about a little rest and relaxation in the sun with a good book? Again, nothing new to report: plenty of research shows this to be one of the most effective means of relaxation. There wasn't a book that she hadn't already read, and there wasn't a query that she hadn't already highlighted, looked into, and later annotated for clarification.So then she did some household chores: laundry, dusting, tidying. Check. Once again - nothing new to report. There was nothing to dispute about the fact that a clean and tidy environment is conducive to mental well-being.Half a day in, and Sucrose had not had the occasion to ask "why" or "how" even once.She was bored, restless, and angsty, and she could not calm herself down.She was desperate to throw herself at a research problem. It didn't matter what it was: She would have happily researched the potted plants on the terrace, even if nothing came of it. Anything just to pass the time.But wherever she looked - the Lamp Grass to her left, the Sweet Flower in front of her, or the Cecilia to her right - all she found were things that she had previously researched in exhaustive detail.Finally, she gave up and forced herself to go to sleep. The next day, she reported to the laboratory first thing in the morning."All day long, you have nothing to research, and nothing to question. That's not rest, it's torture!"
Sucrose's childhood was no different from anyone else's in Mondstadt. She had loving parents, she had her best friends. Life was simple, and beautiful.Her most enduring childhood memory is a story she once heard about a wonderful paradise.Somewhere in a far-flung corner of Teyvat, there was an undiscovered domain with pretty pink flowers the height of a hundred people, teeny-tiny floating fairies flying over all the place, and beautiful unicorns, the pinnacle of perfection.Sucrose and her two best friends believed that if only they could reach this magical place, they would surely live happily ever after.But time went by, and one of her friends left on a long journey with her adventurer parents, never to return.The other suffered a domestic tragedy: Her father fell ill and passed away, her whole personality changed, and she broke off her friendship with Sucrose. The promise that they had once made to reunite some day in the future no longer meant anything.Sucrose felt lonelier then than she ever had felt before in her whole life. They hadn't even set eyes on paradise yet, and already her friends were gone...Well. Even if they were destined to never meet again, Sucrose was desperate to honor their past friendship in some way. That was when she discovered the existence of alchemy from a book that she was reading.Sucrose realized: Though she had never had the chance to find the entrance to that wondrous place, she now had the opportunity to be the creator of her own paradise.Thus began her study of bio-alchemy, and she poured all of her curiosity and passion into it.Still, she has never once mentioned the story of paradise and her bygone friendships to anyone else.Perhaps one day, when that place she first learned of in a children's storybook finally becomes a reality in the real world, her friends will return.
Sucrose has a set of strict requirements when it comes to the selection of species for her personal paradise. After experimentation, specimens that are up to standard she tags with "pass."At first, she wanted to give exotic-sounding names to each of her plants, just like in the stories, but whenever she came to try and name something, she found herself completely at a loss for ideas.After spending so long as a scientist, she insisted on flawless logic even when it came to relatively trivial matters such as naming.Her earliest batch of names included the following: "Grassflower," a flower that grows on grass;"Flowergrass," a grass that grows beneath flowers;"Multigrassflower," a flower that grows on dense grass, and so on and so forth.Even such un-paradisiacal names as these would take Sucrose forever to come up with - far longer than the duration of the experiments themselves.In the end, she gave up on naming altogether and simply used the specimen identifiers from her research notes instead. Yes, this meant the names ended up being much longer, but, but......But anyway, Sucrose is the creator of this paradise, so why shouldn't she get to name things any way she wants to?
It was on an afternoon just like any other that Sucrose received her Vision.Ready to begin her one-hundred-and-fifty-ninth dandelion-seed simmering experiment, she poured her carefully crafted alchemical solution into the cauldron.Instantly, the cauldron hit boiling point, and the entire room was filled with steam. Sucrose rushed to the cauldron, anxious to see what new transmutation had occurred this time; in her excitement, she even burned both of her hands on the lip of the cauldron.Much to her disappointment, however, the Dandelion Seeds had once again burned to a crisp. But there was something new there, too: lying there amidst the black Dandelion Seeds was a Vision.And yet, rather than pouring out the liquid and taking her Vision, she first thought for a moment and then lit the fire up again to continue simmering the contents of the cauldron.She was curious to know what further reactions might occur between Dandelion Seeds and Visions.Sadly, the experiment ended in failure after three hours of constant simmering.Still, there was no denying that she had reaped a great reward from this experiment, for the elemental energy provided by her Vision would become her single greatest asset in her future bio-alchemical endeavors.

<title>Anemogranum</title>
<text>Sometimes in the wild you may see a mysterious kind of life form called an Anemogranum. These curious beings will follow travelers around. Gather several Anemograna together to form a wind current. Loading Screen: Anemograna
Anemograna are Grana that appear on the ground in sets of three. Each individual granum appears as a bluish fairy rotating around a very small updraft. The grana can be collected by running into them. The grana will then become attached to the player for a limited time and decrease their Stamina consumption by 30%, after which it respawns in its original location and must be collected again. If the active character collects all three Anemograna in an area, a Wind Current is created at their current location. Some Anemoculus Anemoculi can only be collected using this method, or their collection is made significantly easier by using Anemograna, provided that all of the required Anemograna can be found in time, as some are more hidden.
Anemograna can be found in Mondstadt, including Dragonspine. The Anemograna in Dragonspine have mutated to accommodate their environment.Mondstadt Anemograna
Wind Currents
When three Anemograna are collected, their power is released and a small Wind Current on your location is temporarily formed. This effect can be triggered early by using an Anemo Elemental Skill or Elemental Burst, after collecting only 1 or 2 Anemograna. In Dragonspine, this effect can be triggered with a Cryo Elemental Skill or Burst instead. Note that it is the activation of the skill that triggers this effect, not its damage.
Being inside the wind current created by Cryo Anemograna will increase the accumulation rate of Sheer Cold.
After a certain period of time, the Anemograna will return to their original locations and any Wind Current created will lose its effect. However, in Confront Stormterror, platforms affected by Energy Rain will have their Anemograna instantly and permanently activate Wind Currents.</text>

<title>Naganohara Fireworks Show</title>
<text>Fireworks that disappear in a flash of light are probably the furthest thing away from the eternity that our Ei Shogun desires. But people's feelings don't just disappear, and it's those feelings that give fireworks their purpose.
The Naganohara Fireworks Show is a festive event run by Naganohara Fireworks. It is well known throughout Inazuma, and is performed at various festivals throughout the year.
During Dreamlike Timelessness, the Traveler helps her gather materials for the show during the Summer Festival.The Firework Girl's Strange Stories
Overview
The Naganohara Family prepares fireworks for each participating family, including paper slips containing the recipes for crafting fireworks in each order.
During the summer, people like to sit on Amakane Island to enjoy the fireworks show over Inazuma City.YouTube:
For different people, fireworks represent different things, like friendship, marriage, beliefs. As Yoimiya noticed, people tend to associate fireworks with things precious to them.
History
The rainbows become fireworks, and they my wishes know, my wishes rise into the skies, and through the night they show.|Old Inazuman folksong
The Naganohara Fireworks Show first began over a century ago with a commemorative show set up by the Yashiro Commission, with fireworks created by the most expert pyrotechnicians. The show began to occur more frequently as fireworks became more common, and families began to participate via the paper slip system by setting off their favorite fireworks, turning it into a cherished tradition.
50 years ago, Imatani Saburou proposed to his wife Imatani Kaori at the event.A Sliver of Hope Takami from the Yashiro Commission helps manage the fireworks show on Amakane Island. Watching the fireworks show as a kid even inspired her to work on the fireworks show growing up to help people appreciate the beauty of fireworks.Takami
On the first year Yoimiya took over, Kamisato Ayaka requested that she add the Electro Mitsudomoe, the emblem of the Raiden Shogun, into the fireworks show, as the Shogun herself would be watching from Tenshukaku. The fireworks display that year was an elaborate scene of Inazuma City, and when viewed from an angle from Tenshukaku, the fireworks aligned to create the Electro Mitsudomoe.</text>

Now, all that remains within that armor is the will to "fight for something, someone, and some matter."Depending on how much wear and tear they have undergone, they are by turns known as "Shadowy Husks" or "Black Serpent Knights."
The Black Serpents are an Elite Enemy elite enemy group. Members of Khaenri'ah's royal guard, they have been since affected by the curse and have lost their memories.
Outside of quests and the Spiral Abyss, they are found in The Chasm: Underground Mines.
In combat, the Black Serpents are fairly durable enemies that use slow elemental attacks. When one of their attacks is fully absorbed by a player's Shield, they will grant themselves and/or other nearby Black Serpents a buff at the cost of a percentage of their current HP.

Types
The Black Serpents, while considered one group in the Adventurer Handbook, have two subclasses: Shadowy Husks and Black Serpent Knights.
Shadowy Husks
* Shadowy Husk: Defender - Wields a bow and will create a shield that protects itself from attacks from the front and obtain a stackable ATK increase upon hitting a shielded player.
* Shadowy Husk: Line Breaker - Wields a lance and will heal nearby Black Serpents upon hitting a shielded player.
* Shadowy Husk: Standard Bearer - Wields a war banner and will create a Pyro shield for nearby Black Serpents upon hitting a shielded player.
Black Serpent Knights
* Black Serpent Knight: Rockbreaker Ax - Wields dual axes and will enter a rampage state where their damage is converted to Geo and gain a massive defensive improvement when hitting shielded players. Similarly to Fatui Skirmisher - Anemoboxer Vanguard Fatui Anemoboxers, they can dart to nearby Shadowy Husks and protect them with a shield.
* Black Serpent Knight: Windcutter - Wields a greatsword and will obtain an ATK increase and the ability to blink away from the next attack upon hitting a shielded player.
Lore
These silent monsters were originally members of Khaenri'ah's Royal Guard under their captain Dainsleif before the nation's fall. Ever since the cataclysm, they have been suffering from their curse, losing most of their humanity in the process. Depending on how far they've degraded, they're either referred to as Shadowy Husks or Black Serpent Knights.
A group of Black Serpent Knights gathered at The Chasm: Underground Mines the Chasm's mines, led by Halfdan. Although the group was suffering the curse, they were still able to remember Dainsleif's order to protect the people of Khaenri'ah at all costs. Large groups of hilichurls, former civilians of Khaenri'ah, were making their way to the underground depths of the present-day Chasm, somehow aware of a special fountain inside, which was able to remove some of the curse. The group is eventually discovered by the Traveler and Dainsleif; the former was investigating hilichurl activity, while the latter had been pursuing an Abyss Herald. They stumbled upon some hilichurls, before a group of knights attacked them, believing them to be hostiles and were unable to recognize Dainsleif. However, Halfdan was able to recognize him and ordered the knights to stand down, leading them to various areas in the Chasm.
At the same time, the Abyss Order, aware of the fountain's properties, attempts to use an amplification device in the hopes that they could restore the consciousness of those affected by the curse, despite being aware that the chances of success were low. The device instead causes pain to the knights and hilichurls, but Halfdan sacrifices his life to stop the device and passes on peacefully. The status of the remaining knights are not known.
In Sumeru, one of the Schwanenritter, Ynghildr, was presumably lost while fighting abyssal monsters during the cataclysm. Instead, she was corrupted into a Black Serpent Knight and eventually returns to the Ruin Golem in Devantaka Mountain, guarding a control module of the semi-operational golem. The Traveler encounters her while activating various relays in the golem and defeats her.</text>

<title>Bosacius</title>
<text>Bosacius, also called by the title Marshal Vritras, was an adeptus and the leader of the Five Yakshas, who were recognized as the strongest amongst all the yakshas.Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti
The The Yaksha's Wish allows the Traveler to unearth his treasures.
Profile
Bosacius was the eldest of all Yakshas with mastery of the power of Electro. He, along with his fellow Yakshas, were tasked by Morax to defend Liyue against the demons and evils spawned by the remains of Gods that fell during the Archon War. Bosacius took this duty in stride, dedicating his life to battle. While many yakshas existed, Bosacius, Indarias, Bonanus, Menogias, and Xiao Alatus became known as the "Five Yakshas" because of their formidable strength and power.
At some point, Bosacius grew weary of his never-ending duty, having accumulated a great karmic debt which eroded his sanity and memories, and witnessing the dwindling number of yakshas over the years. Believing Liyue was at peace, and with only himself and Alatus left, Bosacius decided to depart from this world and sealed his treasures in the region of Minlin and disappeared.The Yaksha's Wish At some point, Bosacius' karmic debt caused him to lose his sanity, and that was the last time Alatus saw him.
Following his disappearance, Bosacius later re-emerged during the cataclysm 500 years ago. Bloodshed in The Chasm caused by a massive battle between the Millelith and monsters of Khaenri'ah attracted Bosacius. Despite his insanity, Bosacius fought alongside the Millelith in defense of Liyue, eventually leading to his death. Because he no longer remembered his own name, and others could not recognize him, legends of the battle at The Chasm referred to him as the "Nameless Yaksha."
Appearance
Bosacius was a tall yaksha with a muscular frame and most noticeably, four arms. He did not have upper garments but instead possessed multiple purple tattoos in the shape of thunderclouds with lightning. His forearms and hands were gradually hued dark purple distally from his body, with almost claw-like long nails crowning his fingers. He has short, spiky, slicked backed hair with purple strands and green irises.
Like the other Yakshas he habitually wears a mask in battle, which can also be seen as the Thundering Poise piece from the Vermillion Hereafter artifact set in which his lore was featured.
History
Bosacius, like the other yakshas, was summoned by the Geo Archon, Rex Lapis, to fight the demons that were spawned from the remains of defeated gods after the Archon War. Among the multitude of yakshas, Bosacius, Bonanus, Indarias, Menogias, and Alatus were acknowledged as the strongest, and Bosacius was their leader due to his strength and seniority.
The yakshas, though strong, were not all able to handle the darkness they faced. Each encounter with evil imbued them with karma, and the accumulation of karmic debt destroyed them. Bonanus, Indarias, and Menogias, along with many other yakshas, died either in battle against the remnants of old gods or as a result of the madness borne from fear or rage brought about by their karmic debt, which caused yakshas to turn upon one another. Bosacius witnessed several of his beloved comrades end each other's lives.
Others grew weary of the constant bloodshed and suffering, and abandoned their duties. Bosacius was among them; he was the second-to-last yaksha to remain, alongside Alatus. Tired of his duties, he eventually chose to depart after seeing that Liyue was finally at peace. However, he later succumbed to his karmic debt and went mad, forgetting his own name.
During the cataclysm, hordes of monsters from Khaenri'ah attempted to invade Liyue through The Chasm. Having completely lost his sanity by then, Bosacius had only arrived at the battle because he had been attracted by the bloodshed. He joined the battle, fighting in defense of Liyue alongside the thaumaturge Boyang, Boyang's brother Rongzhao, and the Millelith. Due to his shattered sanity, he frequently mistook the people around him as his Yaksha comrades. Because the threat posed by the monsters was nigh-insurmountable, Bosacius, alongside Boyang, Rongzhao, and other members of the Millelith, devised a plan to change the tide of the fight. By using the Fantastic Compass, a catalyst which had the power to manipulate space, they could trap and seal away the monsters. However, this plan came with a great cost: the catalyst required significant energy from both a mortal and an adeptus to power it, and the trap would seal some of them away along with the monsters. With no other choice, Bosacius and Boyang volunteered to sacrifice themselves for the sake of Liyue.
Sealed along with the monsters, Bosacius, Boyang and the other Millelith soldiers eventually perished. Bosacius and Boyang were the last to perish, and together they wandered around the chaotic space. Before he died, Bosacius became lucid enough to remember his comrades, his duty, and his name.
Although none of the survivors of the battle in The Chasm knew of Bosacius' name, they preserved the memory of his gallant actions during the battle. Bosacius became known as the "Nameless Yaksha" in legends concerning the battle.
Alatus, who took up the name Xiao sometime afterwards, was curious as to Bosacius' fate and believed that he may had been the Nameless Yaksha that had been referred to by those who fought there. He travelled to the Chasm and met with the Traveler, Paimon, Yelan, Arataki Itto and Kuki Shinobu by coincidence. Upon falling into The Chasm's Bed, Xiao discovered that the Nameless Yaksha was actually Bosacius. While exploring a domain, an illusory manifestation of Bosacius fought Xiao but eventually expired after expending its energy.

The conflicts surrounding the cataclysm primarily revolve around the encroachment of the Abyss - an otherworldly power at odds with Celestia's power - and the destruction of Khaenri'ah, a nation that lived without the influence of the gods. While the exact order of events is unknown, monsters carrying Abyssal power spewed forth from Khaenri'ah and wreaked havoc throughout Teyvat. Khaenri'ah's attempt to rebel against the gods ended with its destruction at the hands of the gods and the Heavenly Principles. This led survivors from the fallen nation to bear grudges against Celestia and the The Seven Seven Archons, while The Seven themselves grew embittered towards Celestia. Two of the Teyvat Chapter's main antagonistic groups, the Abyss Order and the Fatui, were established as a direct response to Celestia's actions.Dishonorable TrialPale Flame
The exact circumstances surrounding the cataclysm remain a mystery, but it is linked to the "truth of this world." The Traveler's journey is to uncover said truth, during which they will learn more about the cataclysm.

section=1 Timeline TimelineNote
Khaenri'ah's Destruction
The order of events and the motivations of those involved in the cataclysm are not fully known, although a few perspectives have been presented throughout the game.
Khaenri'ah's Ambition
Several thousand years ago, around the time the ancient civilization Sal Vindagnyr fell,Scribe's BoxCurrently, Khaenri'ah is the only known nation that was established with the intention of living without gods. the kingdom of Khaenri'ah was established as a nation without gods and its inhabitants considered their nation to be the "pride of humankind." Khaenri'ah's existence and its goal of living independently from the gods were not secrets in Teyvat, and people from the Seven Nations have joined the original founders of Khaenri'ah over the millennia.Fortune-Mocking Pedigree
People of Khaenri'ah suspected that the so-called "gods" - and in particular the entity known as the Heavenly Principles - were in fact alien to this world and had usurped it from its original denizens. They knew the rumor that "the [starry] skies of Teyvat are fake"Where Ancient Stars AlignWhere the Boat of Consciousness LiesCompare the Chinese versions of Dottore's "skies of Teyvat are fake" zh=「提瓦特的星空是虚假的」 zh_tl='Teyvat's starry sky is fake' line in 'Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies' with Scaramouche's line in 'Where Ancient Stars Align': "The stars, the sky... It's all a gigantic hoax. A lie." zh=星空本身，就是个巨大的谎言。 zh_tl=The starry sky itself is a gigantic lie. - which was completely unknown to the second God of Wisdom Lesser Lord Kusanali before she learned of it from Il Dottore during the events of Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies. Khaenri'ah began plotting to rebel against and overthrow the gods. They developed Automatons now known as Ruin Machines as a means to fight against Celestia, and originally knew "Ruin Guards" as "Field Tillers," as they believed that '"The land is not to be tilled with farming tools, but rather to be fought for with steel and blood."'A Herald Without Adherents
Few Khaenri'ahn statements have emerged regarding their perspective on the Archon War, which led to the establishment of The Seven. However, they had some notable activities during that time period. Ruin Machines appeared in Teyvat as early as 3,700 years ago and some were collected by Guizhong during her research into mechanics.Voyage to the Sanguine SkyBecause Ruin Machines were developed by the people of Khaenri'ah, the fact that Guizhong was able to collect some before she died 3,700 years ago indicates that Khaenri'ah already existed by then. Shortly before the last people in Enkanomiya emigrated to Watatsumi Island, diplomats from Khaenri'ah traveled to Enkanomiya to find evidence that the gods were usurpers. They attempted to steal the forbidden book 'Before Sun and Moon', which held an account of the ancient world ruled by the Primordial One up until its clash with the Second Who Came, but failed to make away with it due to Antei's intervention.Collection of Dragons and SnakesAntigonus
It is unclear why the gods never made a move against Khaenri'ah over its long history, but it is heavily implied that Celestia finally took action 500 years ago due to Khaenri'ah's increasing involvement with the Abyss and forbidden knowledge, which are inherently corruptive towards Teyvat.
The Abyss and Forbidden Knowledge
The Abyss' power is described as "alien" to the world of Teyvat and is the only power capable of tainting the power of the gods.Chunk of Aerosiderite Forbidden knowledge, which stems from the depths of the Abyss, cannot be understood by even the Gods of Wisdom themselves, and its effects on mortals are both dangerous and maddening - capable of driving them insane and manifesting as deadly diseases such as Eleazar. The world itself appears to decay and die under its influence as evidenced by the The Withering Withering. If forbidden knowledge is not eradicated completely, even traces of it would continue to forever plague the world.
The first presumed emergence of Abyssal power in Teyvat occurred during the war between the Primordial One and the Second Who Came. Nabu Malikata, a survivor of the Seelie race - which had once been heavenly envoys tasked with guiding humanity - recounted to King Deshret how "'invaders descended from beyond the firmament, bringing with them destruction, overturning rivers, spreading plagues,'" and that these invaders not only brought war to the Seelie but also vainly attempted to break the "shackles" to the land.Amethyst Crown note=Chinese 「自外而来者为我曾经的族人带来了战争，亦为大地带来突破桎梏的妄想…」 tl='The outsiders brought war to my former kin, and brought to the earth a vain attempt to break [or "the vain hope of breaking"] the restraints...'The English localization's '"'they also brought about illusions that could break through shackles to the land'"' in Amethyst Crown's description is poorly worded, as it can be misconstrued to mean that the invaders had a power of illusions that was capable of breaking through shackles. The original Chinese text is clear that the invaders' attempt to break the shackles was doomed to fail. Afterwards, the Primordial One cast down the Divine Nail divine nails to mend the earth, which also laid waste to the mortal realm.Amethyst Crown This roughly aligns with the timeline of Sal Vindagnyr's destruction, which in turn indicates that the kingdom of Khaenri'ah formed around this time period.
The "shackles" may include one or all of the "cycle of seven;" "sun, moon, and weight;" "barrier between life and death;" and/or the "original principles of rules, verdicts, and grace." King Deshret mentions that the "dark poison penetrated the earth," wherein the "dark poison" refers to Abyssal power, and goes on to state '"The beastly trail from the poison should be cut off, for taking poison is a sin running deeper than the sky. But how sweet the whispers can be, and how clear the wisdom of which they speak..."' Hoping to overthrow the Heavenly Principles himself, King Deshret later inadvertently spread forbidden knowledge, bringing his kingdom to ruin.Staff of the Scarlet Sands
In Sumeru, which Khaenri'ah was located underneath,Destined Encounter another four notable incidents involving the Abyss and/or forbidden knowledge have occurred. While the first two incidents have no direct relation to Khaenri'ah or the cataclysm, they illustrate the destructiveness of Abyssal power to Teyvat:
# Thousands of years ago, as the final part of her vengeance against Ormazd, Liloupar ultimately utilized the power of the Abyss to wreak havoc in the oasis kingdom. Parvezravan and many of the city's inhabitants turned into monsters, while the capital city fell into a deep chasm within the earth.Memories of Gurabad A plague also overran the city and devastated the population.The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin
# Before Liloupar's incident, Nabu Malikata sacrificed herself to help King Deshret learn the secrets of the skies and the Abyss to further his ambition of making humanity into the "god of gods."Secret-Keeper's Magic BottleWilting Feast This caused the land to be engulfed by a sandstorm and while King Deshret survived, his continued attempts to turn humanity into the "god of gods" eventually brought forbidden knowledge to his people sometime after Liloupar's incident. This knowledge brought forth the demise of his once-glorious desert civilization, filling the minds of his people with "crazed whispers" and causing dark necrotic scales to manifest on their bodies. It is implied that the land itself would have withered away were it not for the timely intervention of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, who built temples infused with the divine power of life to slow down the spread of the blight. This threat was only completely eradicated after King Deshret chose to sacrifice himself, purging forbidden knowledge from the world for good.Secret of the Scorching Desert
# During the cataclysm, another resurgence of Abyssal power and forbidden knowledge occurred. This time, the disaster was so severe that it brought ruin to the rainforest and infected Irminsul itself - and by extension, the consciousness of the Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, who was the avatar of Irminsul. While the Dendro Archon gave her life trying to combat the knowledge pollution, she could only stall its progression as traces of it yet remained in her corrupted conscious in Irminsul, creating Withering Zones, causing Eleazar, and even triggering earthquakes and sandstorms in the desert for the next 500 years. During Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies, Lesser Lord Kusanali erases the remnant memory of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata in Irminsul, which successfully eradicates the knowledge pollution - but comes at the cost of the entire world of Teyvat forgetting that Rukkhadevata ever existed. The only known person known to remember Rukkhadevata afterwards is the Traveler, who lies outside of Teyvat's laws.
# During the cataclysm, the area known as the Girdle of the Sands was greatly affected by the Abyss, with the Pari, a sprite-like race, having to fight against the corruption alongside the Nagarjunites. While a great tree sprouted in Vourukasha Oasis unleashing pure energy, at Tunigi Hollow, a current of Abyssal energy flowed through it, resulting in both sides being in a deadlock in past 500 years. The tree was nearing the verge of collapse until the Traveler intervened, removing the abyssal power and cleansing the tree with the help of the Puri.
The Art of Khemia
The Art of Khemia, a form of alchemy developed in Khaenri'ah that allows for the creation of life itself, has also been hinted as a cause for Khaenri'ah's destruction. Because Khaenri'ah was established underground and therefore had few natural fauna, the Art of Khemia was developed as a means to create life for the sake of survivability. It is unclear whether the Art of Khemia was originally developed with the Abyss' power, but it certainly was by the time of the cataclysm.
After Khaenri'ah fell, the alchemist "Gold" Rhinedottir became a "sinner" and created an "army of shadowy monsters" that included the dark dragon Durin. These creations, empowered by an "all-consuming darkness" capable of tainting even the powers of The Seven, destroyed all in their path once they were unleashed on Teyvat. Rhinedottir's motivations for unleashing her creations and causing widespread destruction is unknown and some of them, such as the Rifthounds, appear to have run free on their own. Durin was under the impression that she sent him aboveground to display his "beauty," and was unconscious of his actions and the destruction he caused once he reached Mondstadt up until the moment of his death.
The Arrival of Outlanders
As part of their ambition to overthrow the Heavenly Principles, the sages of Khaenri'ah took an interest in the Abyss, believing that so long as they could control the Abyss, they could control "everything."Portended FateIn the original Chinese text, Chlothar specifies '"And as long as Khaenri'ah could control the Abyss, they could control everything!"' zh=而坎瑞亚只要掌控了深渊，就能掌控一切！ The English localization can be misconstrued to mean they thought the Traveler's sibling could control the Abyss, so this clarification has been added. Sometime around 500 years ago, the Traveler's Sibling Traveler's sibling descended on this world after the "heavens [Sky] responded to the summoning,"The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's CallIn the original Chinese version, Scaramouche says "Plus, it's because the Sky responded to the summoning that f=he descended on this world." zh=而且，是因为「天空」回应了召唤，f=他才降临至此世. Notably, 「天空」 tl=Sky is treated as a special term, which is not conveyed in the English localization. and traveled to Khaenri'ah first.A Toast to Victory
The Khaenri'ahns placed their hopes in the Traveler's sibling, seeing them as someone who represented the Abyss and would bring "new strength and hope" to them. They became the "Prince"/"Princess" of Khaenri'ah and Pierro is said to have lived with them for a time. However, the sibling's involvement became a catalyst for the cataclysm instead, something Chlothar Chlothar Alberich berated them for when they met after Khaenri'ah fell.
Notably, even though both the Traveler and their sibling descended to this world after having traveled to countless worlds following the destruction of their home world,Sword of Descension the sibling's activities in this world were recorded in Irminsul, which only contains records of those native to this world. This has led the Fatui not to consider the sibling as a Descender when the Traveler is, and Lesser Lord Kusanali suggests that the sibling is actually native to this world despite the Traveler's memories indicating that this is not possible. Scaramouche later posits that Khaenri'ah has something to do with this discrepancy, and his speculation is informed by the information given to him by the former Khaenri'ahn royal mage Pierro.
The Fatui have recorded at least four Descenders, the first of which Lesser Lord Kusanali presumes is the Heavenly Principles, who aligns with the Primordial One (or the "eternal throne of the heavens") mentioned in 'Before Sun and Moon',The Byakuyakoku Collection and the fourth of which is the Traveler. It can be assumed from 'Before Sun and Moon' and from Nabu Malikata's account that the second Descender is likely the entity known as the Second Who Came (or "second throne of the heavens"), who may also be the outlander whom a Seelie ancestor fell in love with - which led to the destruction of heaven and earth merely thirty days after their union.Records of Jueyun
Also noteworthy is that when the traveling twins attempted to leave Teyvat, the Unknown God who introduced herself as the "sustainer of Heavenly Principles" calls the twins "outlanders" when she confronts them, indicating that she knew they both were not from this world. She also seemed to be specifically targeting the sibling; after capturing the sibling, she merely gazes at the sibling's cube in her hand and pays no heed to the Traveler up until they attempt to attack her.Wanderer's Trail How or why the sibling gained the freedom to wander Teyvat after their presumed capture, when the Traveler was not freed for another 500 years, has yet to be seen.
Celestia's Punishment
Two concepts closely associated with Celestia have been brought up regarding Khaenri'ah's destruction: sin and the Heavenly Principles (also referred to as "destiny"). Based on lore surrounding Orobashi and the people of Enkanomiya, "sin" consists of both knowledge and actions deemed subversive in Celestia's eyes.The Subterranean Trials of Drake and Serpent The exact nature of the Heavenly Principles is a mystery, but it seems to be linked to the concepts of the relentless flow of time and the impermanence of the mortal realm.
Pierro, who co-founded the Fatui with the Tsaritsa Cryo Archon after the cataclysm, mentions that the "sages" from his home country - Khaenri'ah - tore away the "veil of sin," thereby "ushering in a tide of divine wrath, destruction, and foolishness."Mocking Mask People of Khaenri'ah have been referred to as "sinners," both by Khaenri'ahns in reference to themselves and in other sources. Kaeya remarks that all that is left in Khaenri'ah are sinners who "aren't worth talking about, Rhinedottir (as Gold) is described as a "sinner"Skyward PrideIn the original Chinese version of 'Breeze Amidst the Forest, Vol. I',  where the English localization says "The alchemist known as Gold was corrupted by their own greed and ambition," it instead says 被称为「黄金」的炼金士堕落为了罪人 tl=The alchemist known as Gold fell from grace and became a sinner. and "great sinner."
While Khaenri'ah's sins have not been explicitly stated, Enkanomiya may provide enough information to make some hypotheses. For holding an account of the ancient world in 'Before Sun and Moon', which was written by a scribe of Istaroth and later inadvertently read by Orobashi, all of Watatsumi was pronounced guilty with "four counts of the sin of profanity, and a further eight counts for the sin of deceiving living souls."Eboshi To prevent its people from being collectively punished, Orobashi agreed to take their sins on itself and go to its death to pay the price, and banned the book. Shortly before revealing himself to be an Abyss Lector and attacking the Traveler, Enjou tells them that he is "one such sinner - one who has committed the sins of deception and betrayal."
The Heavenly Principles, meanwhile, are something both The Seven and the Abyss Order view in a negative light. While recounting the events of the cataclysm and how they led to her current obsession with Eternity, Ei says she saw "a nation stride forward and lose everything to the Heavenly Principles."YouTube:  After the remains of Makoto's power is used to plant the Sacred Sakura in the past, Makoto says: 'Eternity extends time into infinity, dreams illuminate each moment within. When both shine in unison, the Sacred Sakura blooms from the darkness, finally free from the clutches of the Heavenly Principles.' Furthermore, Ei's dialogue afterwards suggests that Istaroth had a hand in Makoto's ability too.Radiant Sakura
Several other figures have voiced their opinion that Celestia's punishment of Khaenri'ah was cruel and unjust. It is the reason why the Traveler's Sibling seeks to wage endless war against "destiny" until the "thrones" are toppled, and why the Tsaritsa seeks to rebel against the divine and create a new world.Polar StarYouTube:  To oppose both the Abyss Order and Celestia, the Tsaritsa established the Fatui, with Pierro as its first member.
At the same time, Celestia's attack may have been triggered by Khaenri'ah's actions. Dainsleif warns the Traveler against "trying to overthrow them [the gods], or hunt[ing] them down," despite previously voicing his disdain towards them. When the Traveler questions his contradictory statements, he explains that he wants to avoid repeating the "failings of my forebears." Pierro's statement about how the sages of his nation "ushered in" the destruction wrought on them suggests he believes they had some culpability in causing their own destruction. While musing to himself before La Signora's funeral, he alludes to these same sages, saying "The sages think themselves to be all-knowing, but we [the Fatui] alone are wise to the virtue in those acts of folly."This same quote was used in a Chinese-only official teaser for the Eleven Fatui Harbingers before Tartaglia's playable release.
Other Potential Causes
While his exact deeds are a mystery, the kitsune Urakusai is believed to have had some involvement in the Abyss' attack during the cataclysm. After discovering what he had done, the Kitsune Saiguu angrily banished him to parts unknown, then moved to Tenshukaku in preparation for the Abyss' attack.New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune</text>

<title>Sayu/Lore</title>
<text>Sayu, Shuumatsuban's resident ninja, is obsessed with sleeping and growing taller.She has mastered all kinds of ninjutsu to run away and hide in pursuit of opportunities to laze around and sleep.Such an extraordinary skillset may have very unexpected uses.
Personality
A pint-sized ninja attached to the Shuumatsuban, who always seems sleep-deprived.
Sayu is a seemingly eternally sleep-deprived ninja who uses her skills to hide from work and responsibilities. Her height is something she's deeply unsatisfied with, believing that sleep can replenish all her energy and help her grow taller.YouTube:  In order to live by this principle and have as much time to nap as possible, she honed her ninjutsu to perfection.
While she is particularly renowned for her apparent laziness, the members of the Shuumatsuban know that she is loyal to their cause as she would never go against their principlesA Mysterious Order and wouldn't slack off on extremely important matters. Ayaka believes that Sayu's laziness came from her sensei's abrupt departure, as she looked up to them and when they left, became lost and confused.
Of course, from Sayu's point of view, this so-called "laziness" is just better time allocation which allows her to focus on things... like sleeping and growing taller. She does not like it when people pat her head, believing that doing so impedes her growth. She tolerates headpats from both the Traveler and Yae Miko, although the latter is out of fear of retaliation by the Guuji.
While a particularly skilled ninja, Sayu usually handles reconnaissance and other miscellaneous tasks. While she is trained in combat, the arts she learned were mostly intended for stealth and evasion. She appreciates the Traveler's company, willing to work harder for their sake.Where the Dandelions Find Rest While dressed as a mujina, who she finds extremely adorable, Sayu becomes angered whenever people call her a tanuki, even going as far as to attack them.

Are you in a hurry to find Sayu? Oh, I see, she is usually hiding in the trees in the afternoons. I have my own ways of finding her, so please let me know if you need help... Oh, but if I interfere, then I will deny you the pleasure of finishing this task on your own, won't I?
A pint-sized, agile ninja associated with the Shuumatsuban Shiyuumatsu-Ban.
Height has never been one of Sayu's strengths... She stopped growing a long time ago, long enough that she feels like she is trapped in a dream where time has stopped.
Why aren't I growing taller? Am I not getting enough sleep?
And just like that, the pint-sized ninja who awoke to this thought drifted off to sleep again.
Sayu firmly believes that sleep can replenish all her energy and help her grow taller. In order to live by this principle and have as much time to nap as possible, she honed her ninjutsu to perfection.
Fleeing, hiding, transforming... Sayu is the master of all ninjutsu techniques. An unsuspecting leaf or a bucket? It might be just one of Sayu's many disguises!
As a result, if the Shiyuumatsu-Ban needs Sayu's help, they need to commit all efforts to finding her first.
Of course, from Sayu's point of view, this so-called "laziness" is just better time allocation which allows her to focus on things... like sleeping and growing taller.
Character Stories
Most Inazumans are unaware of the existence of the Shuumatsuban. In fact, the Shuumatsuban is a secret organization under the Yashiro Commission.There is also a little ninja who goes by the name of Sayu in the Shuumatsuban, and this fact is even less known.Sayu is a special existence in the Shuumatsuban. She has been raised in the Shuumatsuban since she was a child, and is extremely loyal to the organization.That said, her most prominent trait is not "loyalty", but "laziness."Lazing around is what Sayu does best. She has long mastered the various arts of ninjutsu, particularly those that help her to slack off or shirk her duties, such as escape techniques and aura concealment.People who don't know about her habits will have to make a lot of effort to find her.However, if you ask Sayu about her slacking, she will shrug and reply, "It's not that I'm lazy, I just want to spend my time on more meaningful things."
Sayu is petite and can even be described as delicate.This is also something that bothers her -One by one, her peers are growing taller, but she still has the stature of a child, as her height has not changed at all.Sayu is really anxious about this matter.Day by day, the world seems to be sprouting skyward, and only she remains small as ever.Growing taller has gradually become an obsession in Sayu's mind."As long as I sleep long enough, I can definitely grow taller!"She came to believe this ever so firmly, seizing every opportunity to sleep as much as possible, creating every opportunity and circumstance, even when there were none.People around little Sayu often let her be, as they don't have the heart to disturb her sleep.So now, the situation has progressed such that Sayu is able to fall asleep, even whilst standing.
The ninjutsu that Sayu has learned is not very powerful in combat, but it is quite useful in the matter of slacking off.She is extremely skilled at hiding and covering her tracks, and is an expert in this area. Therefore, if she has the intention to hide, ordinary people absolutely cannot find her.However, even the most ingenious puzzles have answers, and even the most elusive treasures have clues for people to find them. This also holds true for Sayu.After spending enough time with Sayu, one will understand her habits and preferences. Trying to find her doesn't seem so difficult anymore.For example, if you go to Sayu's room early in the morning and lift the covers, the odds are that you will find her in bed.At noon, you can check out the trees near the shrine and who knows, you may find something unexpected.It will be more challenging to find Sayu at night, but it's a good idea to go to her house and wait for her to emerge.However, please remember not to disturb Sayu, who is busy growing taller, unless it is absolutely necessary.Even gentle rabbits bite when provoked, let alone Sayu...
That said, finding Sayu doesn't mean that she can be put to work quietly.Moreover, Sayu's work at the Shuumatsuban is not that of a fixed daily routine, but missions that pop up if and as needed.And so, this happens:When new missions are assigned, you won't see hide or tail of her.By the time she has been found (and with much effort), a more suitable person has been assigned for the mission.And in case there is no other suitable candidate other than Sayu, all the more she will try to slip away, so as not to be overwhelmed by the mission.It's just that... If Sayu used her ninjutsu to work hard, she would have had great accomplishments in the Shuumatsuban.
Sayu is the last successor to the Ninjutsu Art - Yoohoo Art.In this school of ninjutsu, which is known for teasing its enemies, Sayu has learned only ninjutsu such as escape and clone techniques.These ninjutsu are of little use in actual combat, but have an undeniable aesthetic flair.Amongst falling leaves, a silhouette vanishes in a flash, a gentle breeze blows, and a kite suddenly appears on the ground... The incredible scene is comparable to an artistic performance.Thus, whenever there is a festival, Sayu will be invited by various parties to perform her mysterious ninjutsu.If it's Yoimiya who's searching for her, Sayu can still find ways to hide.But if the person in question is Yae Miko Lady Guuji Yae, resistance is futile for Sayu.Clone techniques do nothing to fool the Lady Guuji's sharp eyes, and aura concealment doesn't help Sayu at all in escaping from the Lady Guuji's grasp.Running for the hills is even less feasible, and might even risk angering the Lady Guuji...Fortunately, there are very few circumstances that require Lady Guuji Yae to make a personal appearance.</text>

<title>Catalyst</title>
<text>the weapon type the elemental reaction Catalyze
Catalysts are one of the five weapon types that characters can use in 'Genshin Impact'.
All Normal Attack Normal and Charged Attacks of Catalyst users deal elemental damage.
Normal Attacks
A Catalyst user's Normal Attack chain typically consists of 3–4 single-target or AoE elemental attacks from range. These attacks take varying forms depending on the character, and their maximum ranges vary greatly between characters.
Catalyst Normal Attacks have the following types:
* Projectile: Fire projectiles of various forms that home towards their target. Since these attacks are projectiles, characters with this type of attack may still hit targets out of their targeting range if positioned correctly. (e.g., Ningguang's Sparkling Scatter, Sangonomiya Kokomi's The Shape of Water)
* Non-Projectile: Will hit the target near instantaneously at range, and it is impossible for them to hit targets out of range. (e.g., Lisa's Lightning Touch, Sucrose's Wind Spirit Creation)
* Fixed Hitbox: Have fixed AoE hitboxes originating from the character's location. Hitbox-based Catalyst attacks can also be melee attacks. (e.g., Yae Miko's Spiritfox Sin-Eater, Nahida's Akara, Shikanoin Heizou's Fudou Style Martial Arts)
Charged Attacks
Catalyst users' Charged Attacks typically consume 50 stamina to unleash a more powerful AoE attack after a short delay. These attacks spawn at the target's location when locked on.
Exceptions include:
* Sparkling Scatter Charged Attack: Sparkling Scatter in which Ningguang fires one large homing projectile that deals damage in a small AoE on hit.
* Fudou Style Martial Arts Charged Attack: Fudou Style Martial Arts where Heizou performs a melee attack in the form of an upward kick at the cost of 25 stamina.
* As Water Seeks Equilibrium Charged Attack: Equitable Judgment where Neuvillette can move and change directions while unleashing surging torrents without consuming stamina.
Plunging Attacks
All Catalyst users have similar animations when plunging, which involves them turning into a glowing elemental ball and reappearing upon striking the ground.
Catalyst Plunging Attacks are considered ranged attacks and cannot deal any damage to Geo objects such as Minerals.

<title>Sandrone</title>
<text>Sandrone, also known by her codename "Marionette," is the Seventh of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers.
She makes her first appearance during '' alongside her fellow Harbingers.
Profile
Sandrone was first mentioned in the description of Tartaglia's Character Tale,  which recounts that she once admonished Javert.
According to both Tartaglia and Wanderer, Sandrone is always engrossed in her research on Automatons, and she can be seen riding a modified Ruin Machine in 'A Winter Night's Lazzo'. She has a "terrible personality" and always glares daggers at Tartaglia whenever they meet, causing the latter to wonder if he previously offended her somehow. During Signora's funeral, Sandrone calls Pulcinella, Pantalone, and Arlecchino's banter laughable and when the other Harbingers pay their respects at Signora's coffin by closing their eyes, Sandrone notably does not.YouTube:
It is highly implied that Sandrone is the Harbinger who took an interest in Mosso Lombroso's work and his creation, "Curve", having Baulande's supervisor make contact with Jenck. To escape capture, Jenck destroyed Mosso's laboratory, which subsequently destroyed Curve, who sacrificed its life to save the Traveler, Paimon and Talochard. Jenck was later found trussed up inside the Opera Epiclese with his tongue cut out and mind broken, which Euphrasie surmised was either Jenck's backer not wanting to make enemies out of them or feeling remorse at Curve's destruction.Questions and AnswersOf the two Harbingers known for their interest in machines, the one behind Jenck severely punishes him for causing Curve's destruction and leaves an apology for Talochard, Paimon, and Traveler. This response does not align with The Doctor's characterization, leaving Sandrone as the likely identity of the mystery Harbinger.
Appearance
Sandrone is a young, pale-skinned woman of medium height, with beige-colored hair with a similar style to Traveler the female Traveler: a medium-length bob with two long strands framing her face and has blue-gray eyes.
Her outfit consists of a long white dress with a black corset with the symbol of the Fatui in the middle with a ruby ​​reddish tone, her dress has transparent white wavy sleeves, she wears black gloves that only cover the thumb, she wears stockings white with dark brown boots.

Abyss creatures who can command the power of the elements in combat to a certain extent.For unknown reasons, abyss mages are able to communicate with the hilichurls, thus enabling them to manipulate their minds easily. They say abyss mages utter a long-forgotten language from which they draw magical power.
Abyss Mages are an Elite Enemy elite enemy group part of the Abyss Order. They are usually found with hilichurls and/or their fellow mages.
Abyss Mages can commonly be seen performing rituals or patrolling a set area. When performing a ritual, the mage will not have a shield up, but will quickly generate one if not killed in the first hit. Patrolling mages always have their shield active. Their shields are most effectively destroyed using the appropriate Elemental Reactions (see Shield Shield Gauge Data). When their shields are destroyed, they will become stunned for a long time and can take direct damage. If the mage is not defeated while stunned, they will attempt to regenerate their shield.

<title>Stealth</title>
<text>Stealth '(unofficial name)' is a game state where the player's Combat Talents are replaced with movement related actions, and the player is restricted to only using the Traveler. The Elemental Burst cannot be used in this mode, and the player's Normal Attack is replaced with Crouch, which can activate a Roll by Sprinting.
Types
Hidden
Hidden is a gameplay mode of stealth during which the player's objective is to avoid being spotted by NPCs.
During this mode, the player's Elemental Skill may sometimes be replaced with the ability to throw decoys to distract other NPCs.
If the player is in the line of sight of the opposing NPCs for too long, they will lose the challenge and have to restart. If they reach the target destination, they will successfully complete the challenge.
The rate at which NPCs' stealth gauges fill up depends on the player's distance from the NPC.
Follow
Follow is a gameplay mode of stealth during which the player's objective is to follow an NPC without getting spotted by them or getting too far away from them.
During this mode, the Elemental Skill will be replaced by a crouch function. If one falls in the opposing NPC's of sight or gets too close to them (roughly within 3 meters when not crouched and 1–2 meters when crouched), a spotted gauge above their head will start to fill up.
If the player is seen by the opposing NPC for too long, they will have to restart. Otherwise, they will have to hide and get out of their line of sight, so that the gauge resets. If the opposing NPC gets too far away, the challenge will also end. The text "You are too far away. You will lose your target." may be shown near the top of the screen before this happens.
Staying within 8–10 meters behind  while avoiding their line of sight will help complete the challenge.
Capture
Capture is a gameplay mode of stealth during which the player's objective is to capture an NPC by getting close to them without being spotted. During this mode, the player's Elemental Skill is replaced with Bait (Fish).
If the player is detected by the target, the target will run away and the player will have to find the target again using Elemental Sight.</text>

<title>The Seven</title>
<text>The Seven Archons, typically shortened to The Seven,Abyss Mage (Quest) are the seven gods who preside over the seven regions of Teyvat, established after seven gods emerged as the victors of the Archon War 2,000 years ago. Each Archon is associated with an element and an ideal, by which they formed their territories' environment and determined their method of governance over their regions.
Each Archon has an internal magic focus called a Gnosis, which allows them to resonate directly with Celestia.Ending Note By comparison, Visions are "primitive" - though what exactly a Gnosis is capable of, as well as its purpose beyond a symbol of an Archon's godhood, is unknown.
As of Archon Quest Chapter IV: Act V - 'Masquerade of the Guilty', only six Archon thrones remain. The throne of the Hydro Archon was destroyed and Fontaine's seat of power has been returned to the Neuvillette Hydro Dragon Sovereign.
History
The Archon War began an indeterminate time in the past, and ended around 2,000 years ago. During this period of time, many gods and archons roamed the land, locked in a bitter struggle for supremacy. It appears that the battles associated with the Archon War are a multitude of local struggles that were grouped together by human history. For example, Barbatos became the first Anemo Archon among The Seven after the death of Decarabian 2,600 years ago, while Morax is implied to have already become Geo Archon by the time the last of the original Seven claimed their title and thus brought an end to the War.
The original Seven appeared to be relatively close, sharing a common duty of guiding humanity and often gathering in Liyue for drinks. However, over time, five of The Seven passed away, and some of the newer Archons no longer adhered to the duty of guiding humanity.
A thousand years ago, Barbatos awakened from slumber in response to Vennessa and her people's plight. He recognized them as the "children of Murata," identifying her with the same epithets Dainsleif uses for the Pyro Archon in 'Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail'.The Chinese version of the Manga's Prologue chapter calls her the God of Pyro zh=火之神 zh_rm=Huǒ zhī Shén zh_lit=God of Fire and the God of War zh=战争之神 zh_rm=Zhànzhēng zhī Shén, both of which are titles affiliated with Natlan's Archon in 'Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail'. The English localization of the Prologue translated Murata's titles as "Lady of Fire" and "Lady of War." However, considering Vennessa's tribe had departed from Natlan so long ago that they no longer remembered their heritage, much less Murata's name, Murata's status has been left unclear.
The Cataclysm
500 years ago, the destruction of Khaenri'ah led to forbidden knowledge pollution and the rampage of Rhinedottir's creations, which held the power of the Abyss and ravaged the world of Teyvat.Breeze Amidst the Forest Among those who were perished in the ensuing conflicts were Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, Makoto Raiden Makoto, and Egeria. They were subsequently replaced by Lesser Lord Kusanali, Ei Raiden Ei, and Focalors, respectively. The Tsaritsa was also greatly affected by the cataclysm, resulting in a drastic change in her personality.
The Seven were summoned to Tunigi Hollow, where the worst outpouring of forbidden knowledge and monsters was occurring. During the battle, Egeria was killed and her body turned into the pool of water known as the Amrita. To preserve the water's purity and tether the god to the mortal realm, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata grew the Harvisptokhm - which serves as a seal over the dark hollow and prevents the corruption from spreading further - from the Amrita.The Splendorous Sky That Day The Oceanids, who served the former Hydro Archon but did not get along with Focalors,Life Flows On (II) made their way to the Harvisptokhm in search of their master. Seeing that her current state was not what they had hoped for,Pale Fire (Quest) they spread all over the continent and world itself.Rhodeia of Loch
During this time, the Traveler and Traveler's Sibling their sibling descended on Teyvat and, seeing the chaos, attempted to leave this world, only to run afoul of the Unknown God. While the twins did not meet The Seven during this time, The Seven are aware of them and have been awaiting the Traveler's arrival.Map, Interactable: Statue of The Seven Description Statue of The Seven
Around 400 years ago,The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call Ei completed her research into creating a lifelike puppet, the Shogun, to enforce her vision of Eternity over Inazuma while she retreated to the Plane of Euthymia. Ever since then, the Shogun has been ruling Inazuma in her stead. Though Ei failed to make her puppets compatible with the Gnosis and thus gave it to Yae Miko instead, the Shogun is capable of tremendous feats even without it.
Powers and Abilities
An Archon's source of power has been attributed to two sources: the first is through presiding over their respective region, while the second is from their people's faith in them. Barbatos, who refuses to govern Mondstadt directly and has left Mondstadt for extended periods of time in the past, claims to be the weakest of The Seven as a result; Lesser Lord Kusanali, who was imprisoned in the Sanctuary of Surasthana and shunned by the sages since she was born 500 years ago, explains that her fighting skills are inferior to the Traveler's because she does not hold her people's faith.
The Seven appear to be privy to information that mortals are generally unaware of or deem to be merely fictional. Both Venti and Zhongli are aware of the existences of other worlds, as well as the fact that the Traveler had the power to travel between different worlds.
Elemental Control
Each Archon presides over their respective element and have used it to shape the landscape and climate of their respective territories. This ability seems to be held by any god and not only The Seven, but ever since the end of the Archon War, there have only been seven Archons at a time.
Unlike humans, who rely on resonance with a Vision to use the elements, the Archons seen so far were already affiliated with their elements before becoming Archons: Barbatos was originally a wind spirit who ascended to godhood, historical records regarding Morax address him as the "God of Geo" long before he became the Geo Archon, and Ei (and by proxy, Makoto) is an "incarnation of lightning." Incarnations of Irminsul, i.e. Rukkhadevata and Nahida, are appointed guardians and maintainers of the tree of Irminsul. Nahida was created using a branch of Irminsul, confirming the connection between Irminsul and Dendro.
While people on Teyvat commonly believe that the Archons grant Visions,Endless Research they actually have no control over the distribution of Visions and are largely unaware of circumstances surrounding Visions. However, within her Plane of Euthymia, Ei could enact the "Vision Hunt Decree" effect to seal all characters' Elemental Skills and Elemental Bursts besides the Traveler's.Amidst Stormy Judgment Because the Plane of Euthymia is Ei's personal dimension, there is not enough information to determine how this effect works or whether Ei is capable of enacting this anywhere else.
Gnoses
Gnosis
While gnoses are described as being emblematic of an Archon's status and give them a direct connection to Celestia, their exact purpose and abilities remain a mystery. They evidently grant Archons a large power boost and the "divine ability" to defend their nations, and Zhongli attributes the ability to mint Mora as something that "requires the use of the Geo Archon's power."The Fond Farewell The use of the gnoses' power is not exclusive to its respective Archon, as Nahida also utilized the power of the Electro Gnosis to aid in the healing of Irminsul.
Vessel Creation
On multiple occasions, Archons have fashioned humanoid vessels using their powers as an Archon, perhaps through the use of their Gnoses. Venti's vessel was his first use of his newfound divine power after ascending to godhood as the Anemo Archon. Zhongli's body was likely created through this method as well, as he states that his "structure is not the same as that of normal people." After becoming the first Electro Archon, Makoto "reforged" Ei's body after Ei gave up her bodily form so Makoto could ascend to the "heavenly citadel."Treasured Tales of the Chouken Shinkageuchi
Although gods are immortal, their physical vessels - including those made with the power of an Archon - have finite lifespans and can be "killed," while their consciousness can fade away. By the time of the main story, five of the original Seven have died and been replaced. While pondering how she would overcome her physical lifespan, Ei stumbled on a method of creating synthetic puppets indistinguishable from true life, which she used to create Scaramouche and the Shogun. After giving her Gnosis to Yae Miko for safekeeping, Ei discarded her physical form, the Shogun warning her that there was no return from giving up her body. Due to no longer having a physical body, Ei is only able to manifest herself outside of her Plane of Euthymia by using the body of the puppet as her own.Farewell to the Past
Vessels created through an Archon's power have another major weakness: they are incapable of being healed through ordinary means, including a Vision-bearer's healing abilities. Venti harnesses the power of the Symbol of Mondstadt's Hero twice to heal himself; first was to expunge the abyssal magic that poisoned him via Dvalin when the Traveler unintentionally interrupted them,Let the Wind Lead (Quest) and the second was to recover after having his Gnosis taken by Signora. The exact properties this tree holds is unclear, but it may have a connection to Celestia: according to legend, it grew from the spot where Vennessa ascended to Celestia.
It's important to note that vessels can be the Archons themselves and not different entities. This page specifically refers to a human body created by Archons to live among the people of Teyvat as vessel creation is not exclusive to the Archons, in fact most gods are capable of this feat.

Notes
Trivia
* When casting Elemental Skills and Bursts, the ends of an Archon's hair glow brightly with their element's color.
* Though the only two remaining Archons of the original Seven are Barbatos and Morax, Beelzebul - the current Electro Archon - was also a veteran of the Archon War, with her sister Baal taking the original Electro seat. It is not yet known if any of the other current Archons were active during the Archon War.
** During the Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata is erased from Irminsul, becoming forgotten by all of Teyvat except for the Traveler. In the new history that results from this action, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's existence is replaced by that of Lesser Lord Kusanali; it is now believed that she has been the Dendro Archon since the end of the Archon War - therefore being one of the original Seven - and became imprisoned by the sages of Sumeru after losing her memories during the cataclysm.
* Currently, there is a running gagTo Traverse the Mortal Plane Paimon: Wait a second. Ei... are you saying you don't have any Mora either?[...]Ei: ...Wait, what do you mean, "either"? in which the Archons encountered have no Mora:
** Barbatos, as Venti, has those listening to him buy him drinks instead of giving him Mora. He also pilfers from the Dawn Winery to eat and as soon as he has something that is spendable, he thinks of spending it on drinks. His occupation as a bard is also not lucrative in the first place.
** Morax did not pay attention to price tags prior to beginning life as Zhongli, because he could make Mora as needed with his Gnosis.The Fond Farewell As a result, Zhongli easily spends (or agrees to spend) large amounts of Mora, generally having others pay for his expenses. He also did not think of setting aside some Mora for personal use before relinquishing his Gnosis.
** Beelzebul has no need for Mora, as she simply asks the Tri-Commission to bring the items to her.
** Buer has not mentioned any struggles with Mora in her dialogue, but she struggles to place a hypothetical price tag on the Sanctuary of Surasthana despite ruminating over it for a long time, implying that she struggles to comprehend values that would equate to large amounts of Mora. This is likely due to her 500-year imprisonment in the Sanctuary of Surasthana, where she received information and items for free via the Akasha and sages, respectively.
** Although Furina is not an Archon, she partially continues the running gag, as she is considered unemployed following the Masquerade of the Guilty.
*** While Neuvillette has made arrangements to ensure Furina will not have material issues,Finale she decides to live alone in a small apartment, where she struggles with cooking and ends up only eating macaroni with different sauces.To Yesterday
*** Furina herself does have a substantial amount of Mora, as she saved the Mora she earned over the last few centuries in a "private reserve." She now uses this Mora as an ordinary Fontainian, though she tends to overspend.Furina This may be a direct callback to Zhongli's failure to set aside some "private funds" for himself and how particularly disastrous it can be when he habitually agrees to transactions involving large amounts of Mora.
Etymology
* The term "archon" is a Greek word that refers to "A person who claims the right to rule, or to exercise power or sovereign authority over other human beings." 'Genshin Impact' uses its Gnosticism Gnostic usage,Bilibili:  (original Japanese text included) in which the Archon (Gnosticism) archons are seven supernatural beings who each rule over one of the Classical planet seven planets. They are subservient to the demiurge, the creator of the material universe who is beneath the Monad (Gnosticism) Monad, the true God. By reaching 'gnosis', an understanding of divine knowledge, one can transcend the confines of the material world and escape the dominion of the archons.
** A miHoYo developer interview on the May 2021 edition of the Japanese entertainment magazine PASH states that Gnosticism was selected as the primary mythological basis for 'Genshin Impact', particularly in regards to how Gnosticism deals with the relationship between man and world, and how the archons influence the world.
* Several Archons have their Goetic names directly derived from one of the 72 demons found in the 'Ars Goetia', one of the books in 'The Lesser Key of Solomon'. Gods who predate The Seven have varying levels of similarity to a demon name in the 'Ars Goetia' (see Gods Etymology).
** Barbatos is one of the dukes of Hell.
** Morax (demon) Morax is a president of Hell.
** Bael (demon) Baal is the first king of Hell.
*** Although Beelzebub Beelzebul, Ei's alternate name, is not used in the 'Ars Goetia', it is associated with Baal. Ei herself has continued to rule under the name "Baal."
** Buer (demon) Buer is a Great President of Hell.
** Unlike the other named Archons, Focalors is not a direct lift; instead, it is a derivation of Focalor, a Great Duke of Hell.

<title>Sunchildren</title>
<text>The Sunchildren, or Phaethons, were the puppet rulers of Enkanomiya during the period after the Dainichi Mikoshi was built before Orobashi assumed control.
Story
After Aberaku built the Dainichi Mikoshi and staved off the threat of the Bathysmal Vishaps, peace was established in Enkanomiya, but a cabal of corrupt noblesLotus Eater would manipulate the people of Enkanomiya into worshipping the Dainichi Mikoshi as a god, and chose a child to be the Sunchild and rule over the land.Hyperion's Dirge (Quest) As they were children, the Sunchildren could not truly rule competently, and were instead manipulated to commit heinous deeds as the nobles who controlled them profited from their misrule. Because of this, the Sunchildren would become hated by the people of Enkanomiya, who scapegoated them and blamed them for willful ignorance even though they were aware that the Sunchildren were being manipulated.
Despite their tyranny, the Sunchildren were still children: they led lonely lives and lamented their existences, but the officials tasked with taking care of them were forbidden from saying a word to them.The Phaethons' Syrtos The nobles knew that as the Sunchildren grew into adults, they would eventually realize they were being manipulated. To prevent this, they established a ceremony called the Rite of Solar Return where, when a Sunchild reached a certain age, they would be taken to the inner sanctum of the Dainichi Mikoshi, where they would be incinerated by the artificial sun's high temperatures.
During the time of the first Sunchild, Aberaku opposed the Sunchild and the people who controlled them. As a result, he was accused of high treason, and the first Sunchild had him imprisoned in the Dainichi Mikoshi for life.The Serpent and Drakes of TokoyokokuTemple Inquiry Upon his death, his clothes and body were enshrined in various places in acknowledgement of his achievements.
Eventually, an Enkanomiyan child would discover Orobashi, who was hiding in a cave due to having escaped from the Archon War. The child would ask Orobashi to become their god, and he agreed, overthrowing the Sunchild's rule and becoming Enkanomiya's ruler.
The Divine Bridle was the badge of the Sunchild's office.
List of Sunchildren
There were seven Sunchildren in total, all of whom can be met as part of the Hidden Exploration Objective 'Sunchildren Hide and Seek'.</text>

<title>Kuki Shinobu/Lore</title>
<text>The deputy leader of the Arataki Gang. She wears a unique mask and is rather stoic.Few people know why a talent of this caliber would run away to join a street gang. Even fewer people know what she hides under her mask.
Personality
The capable and reliable deputy leader of the "Arataki Gang." Please note: capable and reliable are not appellations for the "Arataki Gang," but for their deputy leader in specific.
Unlike the rest of her family who work as shrine maidens, Shinobu prefers to forge her own path, having tried various trades, studying in Liyue and even joining the Arataki Gang, simply because they allow her to live how she wants - outside and enjoying various experiences, rather than being shackled to the same duties repeatedly.
She's a stark contrast to the rest of her group, taking matters seriously and in a generally professional matter. She handles the gang's legal issues and gets them out of trouble and tries her best to compensate for any damages that Itto might have caused with his antics. Her professionalism is noted by the people of Hanamizaka, who go to her for advice on various matters and are left impressed as their discussions with her go smoothly and efficiently. While the gang is not on good terms with the Tenryou Commission, she gets along well with Kujou Sara, even giving up her Vision to her for  the sake of their friendship.
Shinobu is on poor terms with her parents, as they had forced her to become a shrine maiden in her youth and felt that they did not care for her well-being along with loathing the job. However, she is still on good terms with her sister Miyuki. She wears a face mask as to prevent others from getting involved in her personal affairs.
She is also known to be terrifying when sufficiently angered, often sourced from having her plans disrupted as a result from having to bail out the Arataki Gang from prison. She often uses physical discipline on the gang as a way to discourage further nonsense, causing the gang members to be fearful of her sometimes. On the other hand, Sayu believes that she will disturb her sleep because "birds of a feather flock together".
Appearance
Arataki's Demonic Deputy
Shinobu uses the Medium Female Characters medium female model. She has light green hair, pale skin, and narrow reddish-violet eyes. She also has reddish-purple markings on her skin at the sides of her waist.
Official Introduction
Kuki Shinobu:Jack of all trades, deputy of the oni
My apologies, I have not sent my regards for a long time. I am writing to introduce a talented person to you. She is very knowledgeable, well-versed in both literature and martial arts, and is an invaluable assistant... Unfortunately, she is currently working for the Arataki Gang and only accepts outsourced consultations, which is a pity.
Although Kuki Shinobu joined the Arataki Gang at a later stage, she is a powerful figure who transformed the whole gang. After she arrived, the gang's business scope expanded to all walks of life, including but not limited to: legal consultation, business negotiation, banquet catering, clothing customization...
What's even more surprising is that the lackadaisical Arataki Gang was able to produce all the relevant practice certificates, all signed with the same name: Kuki Shinobu.
It is said that this second-in-command had studied abroad, and it is also said that she has close affiliations with the Tenryou Commission.
When outsiders hear this, they inevitably have many suspicions. However, the residents of Hanamizaka who often deal with the Arataki Gang are different, and they always go to her for advice on various matters without any reservations.
In their opinion, discussions with Kuki Shinobu are always smooth and efficient.
Just always keep in mind the following two rules:
One, do not attempt to find out how she looks like under her mask.
And two, don't ask why she has to steer clear of the Grand Narukami Shrine every time she heads out for a job.
Character Stories
In the Arataki Gang, where swaggering commotion is something of an aesthetic, the ever-masked and low-key Kuki Shinobu, the gang's second-in-command, stands out all the more against the backdrop of the other, more clamorous members.No matter what sort of mess the others have gotten themselves into, this deputy is often able to solve their problems in a manner that is both professional and highly efficient.Making some snacks for children who had theirs snatched away, giving scratched lacquerware a new coat of paint, and serving as an advocate for detained comrades...Such are her skills that onlookers often wonder if there is anything that she cannot do."I wouldn't say that I'm certified for everything. There are some industries that just don't have standardized assessments, so there's no way to sit for any such tests."Her displeasure finds eloquent expression even behind her mask."Also, how can there be lines of work where you can find employment without the right qualifications? It boggles the mind." Equally mind-boggling, perhaps, is the fact that her deep puzzlement is just as contagious.
People often say that a namecard is one's door into society.Of course, the act of embroidering such cards in gold and silver confounds comprehension, but it is true that giving another party a small card that contains your name, position, and contact details is a very efficient thing to do.When Kuki Shinobu first entered society, the details of her namecard were a matter of serious concern.Ex-Grand Narukami Shrine Maiden? She strangled that thought in its mental crib the moment it was born.Just "Kuki Shinobu"? No, no, that would make her seem like some unemployed bum with neither skill in word or deed.Perhaps she should go get a certification, then. That was common wisdom, after all.Certifications serve as excellent proof of one's efforts, and are convincing ways of scoring points upon introduction - very useful things indeed.After easily getting a couple of such certificates, Shinobu finally reckoned that she could add a little color to her presently-blank namecard.Unfortunately, this process proved to feature pitfalls of its own: out of curiosity and in an effort to test herself, she had gotten a whole load of certifications in one go, causing the prefix section of her namecard to balloon uncontrollably."Junior Chef, Tailor, Actuary, Health Manager, Human Resource Manager..."Having lots of skills is not a bad thing, but there is such a thing of having too many skills, lest one struggle in the snare of figuring out one's titles, like Shinobu did.To this day, Shinobu cannot remember how many namecards she has made.But ever since she joined the Arataki Gang, her very first title has always been "Deputy."
After tasting Kuki Shinobu's very own Roasted Lavender Melon, the Arataki Gang all wept and exclaimed that they never knew that Lavender Melons could be so delicious when roasted.And the flavor, too, was most different from that which had been produced by any other method they had ever tried. Could it be that high-class culinary exams also taught people how to cook Lavender Melons a certain way?Faced with such a question, Shinobu put the melon she was grilling down before slowly telling a story.At that time, she had gone to far-off Liyue to study law, and would visit this place known as Wanmin Restaurant in her free time.The food there was incredibly diverse and made in unique ways, with ingenious ideas that surprised her, despite the fact that she had already obtained a high-level culinary license at the time.From slivers of stir-fried meat immersed in sauce to boiled cabbage with the fragrance of chicken soup... Indeed, the world was wide and full of wonders.And though one might be acquainted with every profession and be certified highly in every one, it is never wise to rest on one's laurels. Indeed, it is only by daring to try and make breakthroughs that one can surpass the limits set down by those who came before.The Arataki Gang did not understand this in full, but they cheered all the same, for there was no harm in that - and their cheers certainly did the melons' flavor little harm.Seeing how they greatly enjoyed their meals, Shinobu kept the ending of the story to herself.Back then, the Xiangling sous chef of Wanmin Restaurant had heard her say these words, and had urged Chef Mao to bring out the Salt and Pepper Slime...Such food, she knew, would never appear in any culinary exam anywhere in the world.Nor would the Arataki Gang want to learn that Shinobu had slathered slime ooze onto Lavender Melons as sauce before grilling them...
The Kuki Clan is a family of shrine maidens, a tradition that spans generations. Members of that family regard service to Narukami as a great honor.This too was the case with her generation. After her sister Miyuki was sent to the Grand Shrine, she was also sent there from a young age as an understudy.Of course, a great store of rules and regulations came with this time-honored tradition: for example, how many days to fast to show one's sincerity and resolve, or how many ablutions were to be performed to avoid profaning the divine...No one ever explained where these rules had come from or how they had been decided. She was simply told that they had existed since way back, and thus were to be followed.When Shinobu first arrived at the shrine, she would sometimes catch a chill from staying on the mountain at night. At this time, her family lived far from the shrine and her sister was out on an errand far afield.A strong-willed child, she did not ask the other shrine maidens for help, but would instead pluck thorned plants one by one, alone, before twining them around her body.According to a traditional saying, this deed would earn you the protection of Narukami and remove the illness from you. So she went on twining that loop of thorns, even as she whispered prayers to Narukami for protection deep into the night, shivering all the while.However, when the night was over, her chill was not cured. All she had earned instead was a tingling red mark around herself.As the days passed, Shinobu would find again and again that the rules were not as foolproof as the ancients might have made them out to be, nor was the role of a shrine maiden quite as indispensable as they had claimed back home.Well then, didn't that mean that the very necessity of the Kuki Clan to become shrine maidens was also up for renegotiation?Some years later, Shinobu had already left the shrine for some time now, and with time to kill, she would flip through a book on herbology.Within its pages, she found that it clearly, indeed vividly, described how the mountainous thorns had paralytic properties that could render birds and beasts unable to move, and that it was this property that led the ancients to include them into medicine to ameliorate topical aches and pains.She was, well... speechless.Shinobu thought to herself that yes, perhaps rules did have rhyme or reason behind them, but to treat the rules as reason in themselves must be treated as an obsolete practice.On further reflection, she could not help but feel that she was happier living her current life.
To find work through which she might truly have freedom, Kuki Shinobu once declined all manner of respectable job offers, only agreeing to being hired as part-time outsourced staff.One of these commissions came from an old lacquerware professional who had accidentally thrown his hip out of whack. The job itself was no challenge to Shinobu, bearer of an advanced certification in this field, but the address of the client was... well, a little special.When she brought the newly-maintained figurine to the Police Station, she ran into a petty thief who was making their escape from that site who, fleeing at all speed as they were, rammed right into her, sending the doll sailing into the air.Seeing that several days' work was about to go down the gutter, Shinobu struck out like lightning, seizing the figurine with one hand before whirling about and tripping the suspect.All at once the surrounding people surged forward, subduing the crook. Afterward, Kujou Sara - seemingly the person who had placed this order - would come and thank her personally.As for the goods, they were perfectly unharmed, much to Sara's surprise - to think that someone in the lacquerware business could have such martial skill!After learning of Shinobu's circumstances and her desire to "find a job that gives her real freedom," Sara would consider for a moment before inviting Shinobu to join the Tenryou Commission."Hmm... No, I think I'll pass. The civil service seems a bit too limiting for me..." At this point, Shinobu hesitated. "But if those legal lectures and martial arts training could be done part-time, I will definitely consider the offer."From that day on, Shinobu would begin a new slew of part-time work.One thing did surprise her, though - the general of the Tenryou Commission would always attend her lectures and demonstrations."It is only right that those who enforce the law should better understand it," so Sara said with perfect earnestness."The opportunity to test myself against similarly-skilled warriors is also not one I get often," Shinobu replied.Sara's straightforward personality and decisive behavior were things Shinobu greatly approved of, and it was through this - and through Sara hiring her often to maintain figurines - that the two would quickly become friends.Sara would also repeat her offer of employment several times, only for Shinobu to decline each time. Yet, this "job that brings true freedom" was not something she would find, either.That is, until one day, when Sara wound up arriving late to the izakaya where they had arranged, as they often did, to meet and have figurines change hands, leaving Shinobu to drink till midnight."That's unexpected. I didn't think you could be late at all, Sara.""Sorry. I was held up by a really rowdy gang...""A gang? And what gang could have troubled you that much?""Well, I wouldn't call them 'trouble' exactly. They call themselves the Arataki Gang..."
The news that the Arataki Gang now had a second-in-command raised a decent (though ultimately small) stir in Hanamizaka.It was rumored that this deputy was well-versed in etiquette, law, and was quite the dapper hand physically as well, bringing the other members to heel within a few days of arriving.Those who had witnessed this deputy's actions first hand were full of praise for them, saying that at long last, the Arataki Gang had someone polite and reasonable added to their ranks.Some did worry about this development, however: the Arataki Gang was, after all, not a proper organization by any measure.The little hullabaloos they had caused in the past were nothing, really, but with the arrival of someone who could be the "brains" of the organization, who might put some discipline into them... Could this not also be the harbinger of worse incidents to come?Not to mention the Gang's daily operations... Other than logistics and transportation, home repair, and performance, they now added tax agency, legal consultation, event management and various other operations that both involved sizable capital investments and a not-insignificant air of danger to them.Surely they weren't intending to do all these things without the right licenses... right?And never mind the licenses, first - if they were to commit fraud in any of these newly-added businesses, they would surely be arrested by the Tenryou Commission!However, these wild guesses and ill-omened rumors would quickly be dispelled. The Arataki Gang's actions afterward were more than enough to show that they were still a gang of their word.Those who have attempted to enlist their new financial services have indeed seen their situations turned right around, and the transparency and uprightness of their processes have been stunning.Of course, it is also a pity that the Gang remains the Gang. The children of Hanamizaka still live in fear of Arataki Itto coming to win their snacks off them come dinner time, and often still return to their homes fuming.In any case, it seems that even this legendary second-in-command will take a long time to reform the Arataki Gang's more... unbound ways.
Kuki Shinobu had yet to wear her mask when she first joined the Arataki Gang.While pursuing a certain business prospect, Shinobu was busy engaging in some serious talks. The other members of the gang were arrayed behind her in a single row, hands behind their backs and unsmiling."Just stay like that and don't say anything," Shinobu had instructed them to do so on short notice. "This is the most effective way of negotiating... For you guys, anyway."The talks were going exactly as Shinobu expected, until a passing child suddenly pointed at her, exclaiming:"Mama, mama, look! That's the shrine maiden who never smiled back at the Grand Shrine! Wow, she looks so cool!"The child was whisked away by her panicked mother, but the quick departure did not change the mottled embarrassment and resignation on her face, as if she could not wait to flee for the hills and forests right that instant.As for Itto's face, it was as if two onikabuto were wrestling for dominance upon it. Genta and the others, try as they might, ultimately lost their poker faces amidst gales of guffaws.The next martial demonstration would, of course, see their faces beaten so hard that they were redder than Shinobu's was at that moment. If only they had known their fate, perhaps they might not have laughed quite so hard.From that day on, Shinobu would sport that mask. Pitch-black and claws bared, it lent her a positively demonic aspect.By the way, it was also that martial demonstration that served as the origin of her moniker "the demonic deputy".
The day she left the shrine, Kuki Shinobu left all the things that she possessed while serving as a shrine maiden behind at home, starting over from the most basic of belongings.As such, she knew immediately that the bag she lifted was not the right weight. Hadn't she only left towels inside it?Reaching into the bag and fishing about, she pulled out, of all things, a glittering Vision, its loveliness so striking such that her sister, Miyuki, could not help but gasp.An irony it was indeed that the shrine maiden who was fleeing her duties would receive a Vision for doing just that.This, of course, was the very first "certification" that Shinobu would receive - from a god, certifying her freedom.Indeed, Miyuki, who had intended to stop her at first, had a change of heart upon witnessing this sign, agreeing to help convince their parents....It was also due to this that she would willingly surrender her Vision while the Vision Hunt Decree was ongoing.For one thing, she did not intend to make life difficult for her friend in the Tenryou Commission, but for the other, the Vision was but one of her many, many certificates.Most things in life could, in any case, be settled without the use of a Vision, nor could the truly obdurate problems be dismissed simply by the dint of that device.Removing generations worth of prejudice, for example, or searching for true, unbound freedom....Or, you know, stopping those dolts in the Arataki Gang from chomping at the bit to "help" her win her Vision back.

<title>The Crux</title>
<text>The Crux zh=南十字 zh_rm=Nánshízì is an armed fleet based in Liyue Harbor and led by Captain Beidou. The Crux is famous throughout Liyue for their daring adventures and rich bounties.
Its flagship, the 'Alcor', can be found (and boarded) off the shores of Guyun Stone Forest, by the southeastern end of the island Domain of Guyun is on.
Overview
The Crux divides its crew into 2 teams: The Shield of the Crux and The Spear of the Crux. The Spear of the Crux consists of individuals that is trained in and responsible for naval warfare as well as handling cargo deals. Those assigned in The Shield, on the other hand, are the ones trained and specialized in comprehensive survival skills to ensure safe navigation. These skills include, but not limited to, maritime emergency rescue, cartography, marine meteorology, and psychological counseling. Other than that, the Shield is also responsible for preparing recreational programs for the crew.A Special GuestLife on the High Seas
There are 2 primary methods the fleet uses to generate income. The first one is through acting as an armed carrier delivering goods between places separated by the sea, while the other is through illegal trading.Beneath the Surface Other than that, the Crux is also one of the parties entrusted by the Liyue Ministry of Civil Affairs to conduct a 2-year intensive navigation training and apprenticeship program. Completing the courses gives participants a Deep Sea Navigation Qualification Certificate required for sailors to sail the sea as well as other rewards provided by the Ministry.Vigilance at Sea
The Crux's expeditions are "more or less" approved by the Liyue Qixing due to Beidou's unusual relationship with the Tianquan Ningguang: Beidou has no fear of her like the rest of Liyue's citizens and adamantly proclaims that no one is her boss, while Ningguang claims she never hires the Crux's services - just Beidou's.
Whenever the Crux returns from a voyage, they hold a three-day celebratory feast. Once, they hired Xiangling, hoping they could save Mora by hiring the not-yet-famous chef. She impressed both Beidou and the crew with her skill, and Beidou ordered the crew to call the girl "Madam Xiangling," proclaiming she would soon become renowned throughout Liyue. Afterwards, Xiangling became a regular guest aboard the fleet in search of new and exotic ingredients.
The Crux's dealings go beyond Liyue's borders, having done business in Inazuma. Beidou's Chief Mate, Juza, has an Inazuman name.Juza's name is based on the Japanese reading of mini=1 ja=重佐 ja_rm=Juusa. His crewmates' names are based on their Chinese readings, indicating that this was a deliberate decision on the English localization's part. Yoimiya occasionally commissions the fleet to send fireworks to Liyue. Beidou and her crew were also hired by Sangonomiya Kokomi as mercenaries for the Watatsumi Army.In the Name of the Resistance
Sometime after Ei enacted the Vision Hunt Decree, Beidou took in Kaedehara Kazuha as a "temporary crewmember," allowing him to escape his pursuers for the time being, though he still remained with them after it was repealed.

<title>Second Who Came</title>
<text>The Second Who Came, also known as the second throne of the heavens, appeared in the world of Teyvat an unknown amount of time after the creation of humanity at the hands of the Primordial One. In the ensuing battle between the Primordial One and the Second Who Came, the heavens and earth were ravaged, with the region of Enkanomiya sinking underwater and becoming severed from the surface world of Teyvat.The Byakuyakoku Collection
Profile
The second throne of the heavens came, and war was rekindled, as it was in the world's creation. That day, the heavens collapsed and the earth was rent asunder. Our ancestors and their ancestral land fell into this place during that conflict.|A scribe of Istaroth
Story
Little is currently known about the identity of the Second Who Came or when they existed relative to other known events in the Teyvat timeline, other than their appearance and conflict occurring untold ages before even the Archon War. The only confirmed information is that they arrived while Enkanomiya was part of the single, unified human civilization that spanned the world; later on, they came in direct conflict with the Primordial One.The Three Great Martial Trials
Due to severe damage they sustained during their conflict with the Second Who Came, the Primordial One "could no longer use their absolute authority to suppress the original order of this world." This caused the Primordial one to collaborate with "one who came after" and create the Gnoses to maintain order.
Enkanomiya Beliefs
A year after the people of Enkanomiya built the Dainichi Mikoshi, they attempted to find a way back home, believing that the war on the surface world was likely over by that point. However, they were unable to find one, as the "powers of prohibition" had sealed Enkanomiya from the surface. According to a scribe of Istaroth, this ban was placed by the Primordial One and accordingly, the Primordial One emerged victorious over the Second Who Came.
Eboshi believes that the "heavenly order" did not want those who knew the true history of the world to return to the surface, hence why the seal was placed. However, since both the Primordial One and the Second Who Came are associated with the heavens, this leaves the identity behind the heavenly order ambiguous.</text>

<title>Corrosion</title>
<text>the separate mechanic exclusive to the Three Realms Gateway Offering event The Encroaching Dark
Corrosion is a Status Effect and Ley Line Disorder where characters Corroded will lose HP every second. Corrosion can stack, and the duration for each stack is counted independently. Active characters can be brought down by Corrosion. When a non-active character's HP is less than a certain percentage, they will no longer lose HP from Corrosion.
Corrosion ignores Shields, DEF and RES.
Overview
The HP Loss and Duration of Corrosion vary by source. HP Loss will be inflicted once when Corrosion is applied, after which it is inflicted once per second until the stack's duration expires.
\text{HP Loss (Per Tick)} = \text{Base HP Loss} + \text{Additional HP Loss}

A wayfaring figure whose identity is a mystery. He dresses like a mountain ascetic, but he certainly does not act the part.
Before the "three betrayals" which changed him and before regaining his memories, the Wanderer is amicable and curious about the world. Right after his creation, he was full of hope and curiosity, yet also sensitive enough to the cruelties of the world that they embittered his personality after long enough. When the Traveler discovers him wandering Sumeru, he is still pleasant, but haunted by a lack of purpose and, similarly to his younger years, worried about fitting in with humanity due to his lacking a human heart. He also expresses a desire to understand what he has done in the past and reclaim that part of himself. After remembering his past and seeing the truth behind his second betrayal, he takes on a personality similar to his previous incarnation, Scaramouche - having a misanthropic worldview and unpleasant personality. He treats everyone around him with contempt and tends to be arrogant due to his divine nature, often acting rude and abrasive.
While Nahida tries her best to help the Wanderer see the more positive sides of humanity, he is still rather cynical of humanity and likens his relationship to her as simply paying off his "debts" to her, despite her insistence otherwise. The Traveler still maintains some degree of caution towards him due to his unpredictable nature and former conflicts with him, which he often pokes fun at. He is fond of bitter tastes and despises sweets.
Appearance
A Wrathful Void
The Wanderer uses the Medium Male Characters medium male model. He has indigo blue eyes framed with red eyeliner, fair skin, and short dark blue hair that reaches his ears.
Official Introduction
Wanderer: Know one heart, know all hearts
"Those who believe cast the gods in glory, while unbelievers witness how gods transcend. But as for him, I will not characterize him as either. All uncertainties are but foundations for his future path."
On a fateful night, a figure arrived at a place that had once been called Tatarasuna. There should no longer have been residents there, but as if destiny had decreed it, a farmer had come there, picking Naku Weed to make a living. Thus it was under the moonlight that he saw a phantom figure standing on the edge of the cliff.
This person wore a wide hat that concealed their face entirely. However, the farmer could hear breathing through the pitter-patter of the rain.
A moment later, the figure spoke. "This is how humans should breathe."
The farmer was terrified that he might had encountered some spirit, and hurriedly hid behind a rock. The figure spoke again. "What are you afraid of? Would a passerby such as I hurt you? I am merely here to tend to the grave of a friend."
Silence filled the air once more. The farmer peeked out from behind the rock, and saw that the figure had vanished. A note drifted to the ground and was instantly soaked by the rain. Three questions had been written on that piece of paper, along with answers that were not yet fully written—
If humans have a heart, why do they not fear the hearts of others?
Due to their inferior nature.
How should one treat others, knowing full well their inferiority?
...
How can one be a human being without a heart?
One without a heart is hardly human.
Chills ran down the farmer's spine as he finished reading the note. Tatarasuna had been deserted for many years, and it had been a long time since anyone came here to pay their respects. And even if there were, why would they appear on such a night?
Character Stories
He needs not introduce himself, for ordinary folk will never get to know him.Nor will he need to immerse himself in the sea of humanity, for he has long forsaken any worthless emotion.Several times now he has risen and fallen, and now he lives only for himself."Wanderer" is how he believes he might be best described - he has no home, no kin, and no destination.Like the breeze, he lives in this world, and he walks its length and breadth.
Many years ago, the Wanderer was not called by that title. Indeed, he has had many, all of which corresponded to a special status he possessed at that time. Today, many of these past affairs have been forgotten.The puppet, the eccentric Kabukimono, the 6th seat of the Fatui Harbingers, The Balladeer...Each of these was a thread of fate tying the puppet's joints down.Any recollection must begin several hundred years ago, when the puppet that shed tears upon being born would not be given a name, but was instead only given a Plume of Luxury small golden feather as proof of his personage.He would be laid to rest within the Shakkei Pavilion, staring blankly at the beauteous scenery within. The flaming maple leaves, the exquisite window lattices... Within that lovely prison, he lost all perception.It was by accident that a kind-hearted samurai named Katsuragi would enter the pavilion and rescue him. It was Katsuragi who brought him to live in Tatarasuna and meet the people who lived there.Then, the puppet was as naive as a newborn, filled with goodwill and gratitude towards humans. Katsuragi, upon seeing the golden pinion on his person, knew that this puppet must not have been of ordinary stock, yet have his reasons not to mention his place of origin. Thus, he omitted all mention of Shakkei Pavilion, instead claiming falsely that he had found the young man while patroling Nazuchi Beach, and he bade the puppet play along so as to not expose the lie.Busy, bustling Tatarasuna was a place of many happy memories for the puppet. There, he was briefly human. There, he was briefly normal.Katsuragi, Mikoshi Nagamasa, Niwa Hisahide Niwa, Miyazaki Kaneo Miyazaki, and many other now-forgotten people from Tatarasuna would teach him to read and write, to start fires and make meals, to forge - yes, they accepted him as their friend.They even asked him: "Don't you want a name? Or are you going to let everyone out there call you the Kabukimono?"Yet he had no dislike for this name."Kabukimono" referred mostly to those who wore vibrant colors and behaved in a peculiar manner. Yes, they made him different, but such was proof of his humanity - proof that he belonged in Tatarasuna.Pity, then, that though he loved this name so, he would be forced to forsake it. For when he no longer wished to become human, it lost its meaning.He would depart, and after arriving in the distant north, would join the wild banquet of the Harbingers, working to win the sixth seat among them.It was the Tsaritsa who would grant him his new title - "The Balladeer." Strength, power, and the desire for conflict - these he already possessed.The chess pieces raised tides of madness amidst battle, and the slaughterers on the stage upended order.In that moment, he was sure that The Balladeer was his true name.
In the early days when Tatarasuna was still a prosperous place, the Wanderer walked amongst its people, going by the name "Kabukimono."And the thing that ended his peaceful life was not all that important in the grand scale of Inazuma's history.Change came to the place in the form of the Akame School Akame Clan and a mechanic from Fontaine named Escher. The two cooperated very closely to further improve forging quality, and in the process, Akame introduced Escher to Niwa, who was also from the three Isshin Art Isshin traditions.Escher's arrival caused quite the stir for a time, for it was through his revolutionary new techniques that they were able to process Crystal Marrow in such a way that their forging efficacy and production were both increased.But as time passed, anomalies emerged within the great central furnace in Tatarasuna. Black gas gathered within the furnace, and it would gradually affect the bodies of the craftspeople there. Forging and smelting were the foundations of life in Tatarasuna, but now they had become death itself.And as the toll mounted, the great furnace further went out of control. None could get close to its core, and even stopping it became nigh impossible.As the highest authority at Tatarasuna, Niwa was forced to enact an information blackout while sending people to Inazuma City to beg aid from Tenshukaku.For some reason, however, those who took to the sea in ships never returned. Horror began seeping into the hearts of Tatarasuna's people.The Kabukimono knew that Niwa needed the Raiden Shogun's aid, but did not know that this was the very year when she had successfully built the perfect puppet using parts of herself as material, thus handing over management of the nation to the Guardian of Eternity. He thus boarded a small boat and braved storm and rain to arrive at Tenshukaku, seeking an audience with the Shogun.But she now dwelled in the Plane of Euthymia, and he was repeatedly refused. In desperation, he displayed the golden feather on his person and asked to see Yae Miko instead.At this time, Miko was busy assisting the Guardian, and though she rushed down as soon as she heard this news, she could only meet the distressed Kabukimono briefly. Yet he had no ears for her promises to send people to their aid immediately, and returned in despair, convinced that the Shogunate had forsaken Tatarasuna.Still, the dispatch was sent, the people were mobilized, and they crossed by sea. Yet they arrived to no great disaster. Indeed, most people knew nothing of what had happened. It was the mechanic, Escher, who explained that Niwa had fled with his family for fear of punishment for his malfeasance, and that the Kabukimono had gone into the core zone in his place, shutting the furnace down.Receiving word that the Kabukimono had been friends with the fleeing Niwa, Yae guessed at the heaviness in his heart and did not wish to further disturb him, merely sending someone to return the feather to him.Later still, he would disappear without a trace from Tatarasuna. But as people reminisced, they could never forget the celebratory dance he had performed together with them on the day that Mikoshi Nagamasa successfully forged his great blade.His steps fluttered lightly like a feather in the wind then, and they could not have known that he, like a feather, would depart from them and journey to places unknown.
After leaving Tatarasuna, the Kabukimono met a young child in a small house by the seaside somewhere in Inazuma.The young boy was weak and sickly, and he lived in a rickety old place into which the rain leaked. Seeing his constantly mud-caked face through the gaps in the decrepit wooden door, the Kabukimono felt something twist in his heart, as if some ancient feeling was being re-awakened. And so, he stayed within that wooden house to care for that sick boy, bringing him melons, fruits, and water to drink, helping him to wipe the filth from his face.Many days passed, and the child's parents did not return. It was only later that the Kabukimono learned that the parents were also workers from Tatarasuna, and they might have lived normal and happy lives, if not for husband and wife contracting some strange illness during their work, often coughing up blood as a result. That they had not returned indicated that they may have passed without any fanfare in some place out there.The child's name was unimportant, for he had another identity: he was the Kabukimono's friend, and family besides. They talked about how they had been born and promised to continue to live together in that ramshackle hut. As proof of their friendship, the Kabukimono took the boy to Shakkei Pavilion to see the place where he had once lived.The flaming maple leaves, the ancient latticed windows... All was as it had once been.At that time, he believed that he would never return here... but he did not realize that the child could die in only one night. One night, barely enough time for the Kabukimono to go out and find some food or swipe some furniture that others no longer had any use for.Though he had already witnessed much change, he never knew that another person's passing was something that could occur in such a brief moment, or that this moment could grant him nothing but pain.After the shock, he felt incomparable fury. He was alone. Again. Was he not once more abandoned?Again! Again! Again!The boy's small body on the ground was curled up like a jumble of flower petals, a corner of it stained red with blood - red like the maple leaves... red like a blazing fire.That night, a great flaming glow lit the seaside. The Kabukimono burned the wooden house, and finding himself an old straw hat from within it, left to begin his long journey.He wandered everywhere, not knowing where to go, and though he would meet many more people along the way, he would never again regard any of them as his companions.
The sixth of Snezhnaya's Fatui Harbingers is known as The Balladeer.And yet this name was not his to own from the start. Indeed, they were yet separated by over a hundred years.After leaving Inazuma, he forsook the name Kabukimono, reverting to his nameless state, and did not even consider taking another until The Jester found him.In the end, such titles as "puppet" or "Kabukimono" were all given to him by mortals. And since he would no longer have them as companions, there was no point in using the names they gave him.But The Jester proved most persuasive, and the puppet was intrigued by the frenzied banquet he spoke of, and so accompanied the man to Snezhnaya to serve in the Fatui.A stranger named The Doctor would welcome him warmly in this frigid northern land, inviting the Wanderer to be the key reference material in his experiments - his grand research project.Puppet-making techniques had their roots in Khaenri'ah, and his nature as a creation of the Electro Archon made him all the more special. The Doctor was fascinated by this field of study, and, using the Wanderer as a foundational blueprint, would perform research and experiments for several decades before finally attaining the techniques that would go on to form the basis for his Segments.In return, The Doctor would unlock the seal on his body, causing his abilities to greatly increase, to the point where he was a match for the lower-ranked Harbingers.But even so, he did not choose another name. His colleagues called him the "puppet," and so he saw himself also - a puppet, unafraid of death and inexhaustible.On the Tsaritsa's orders, he would lead a company to explore the Abyss, and there he spent much time. More than once he was wounded, then repaired by The Doctor, and thus he grew stronger, surviving to be wounded again by ever mightier foes.Much later, he would bring the results of his exploration back to Snezhnaya, gaining the sixth seat in the process. His orders were also changed. Instead of exploring the Abyss, he was now to constantly be on standby, assisting the clandestine activities of the Fatui across the world.And it was only then that he felt that that new name, "The Balladeer," fit him.</text>

<title>Melusine</title>
<text>Awaiting further information. Add appearance of second variant, they have different head protrusions and a different tail.
Melusines are an all-female species in Fontaine. They are the "daughters" of Elynas (NPC) Elynas.Limner, Dreamer, and Robotic Dog
They were first shown in the , as part of a story narrated by Alice showcasing a teaser for the nation of Fontaine.
Lore
Around 400 years ago, the Marechaussee Phantom Marechaussee Hunters and members of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo battled inside the remnants of the great beast Elynas (NPC) Elynas. During this battle, "someone" caused an explosion, killing many and causing the mechanical components of clockwork meka to pierce through Elynas's body. The Melusines were eventually born from these wounds, with the components becoming "tokens" associated with each Melusine.There Will Come Soft Rains
Elynas's consciousness regarded the Melusines as his own daughters, teaching them how to establish a home - Merusea Village - and enabling them to grow and live happily within his own remains. As time passed on, the Melusines could no longer hear Elynas's voice, and by the start of the game's events, only Mamere could hear him. After Mamere met and befriended the Traveler, she could no longer hear his voice.
According to Mamere, all Melusines are born possessing special mementos known as "tokens." These are mechanical components inscribed with runes, and can seemingly be used to interact with and repair Clockwork Meka such as Seymour, who recognizes Mamere's token as his lost "artificed clockwork relay module."
The Melusines would live inside Elynas's body until they met Neuvillette, who brought them outside to the rest of Fontaine.Aeval Fontanians were hesitant to accept Melusines into their society at the time, believing them to be creatures of calamity due to an increase in "strange incidents," coupled with Neuvillette having just been appointed as the Iudex. Carole was one of the few Melusines to venture outside Merusea Village, but she sacrificed herself to prove her innocence after being lured and framed by hardliners who opposed Neuvillette's reforms. Following her sacrifice and the subsequent trial of Vautrin, in which he feigned anger to prove Neuvillette's impartiality and fairness, people began to trust both the Iudex and the Melusines. Neuvillette helped pass a law declaring that all Melusines are to be addressed with she/her pronouns rather than it/its and harsh punishments were imposed for anyone who treated them as monsters. By the events of the game, essentially every Fontanian is willing to protect a Melusine from danger, as exemplified during Neuvillette's Story Quest.
Melusines perceive visions and food differently from humans, and this perception has often confused and/or grossed people out; Mamere's art was considered incomprehensible to most, while Sigewinne's cooking, meant to help restore stamina, has the prisoners of the Fortress of Meropide call it "mystery meat" and an ill omen despite her efforts into making it.The Truth Shrouded in Shadow Likewise, Wriothesley describes her milkshakes as "desolation."
The Breacher Primus do not attack Melusines, as both were born from Elynas' body.
Many Melusines are part of the Marechaussee Phantom due to their powerful eyesight and increased perception relative to normal humans.
Overview
A Melusine is described as diligent with her duties and having a great sense of justice. The Melusine shown in Alice's story, who appears to be Blathine, sports a miniaturized version of the officer's uniform worn by Gardes.
Melusines view the Chief Justice as "[their] ideal of the perfect father." It is also noted that he took up his post before the Melusines first appeared.HoYoLAB:
The denizens of Merusea Village value scrap mechanical parts as a form of currency similar to Mora, called "Strange Part components," due to their aesthetic quality and abundance in the area. Melusines use these components in the exchange of goods such as those sold by Xana, and give them to one another as tokens of gratitude for helping each other out.The Illusion's Finishings
Appearance
Melusines are bipedal creatures of a short stature, and are almost faun-like in appearance. They have long, tufted tails; long ear- or horn-like head protrusions resembling the rhinophore rhinophores of sea slugs; mitten-like hands; and stubby feet. Some have small wing-like appendages on their backs.
Sigewinne is a lone exception, as while she is still a Melusine, she has a "special body" which makes physiologically similar to a human.NPC Dialogue, while riding the Aquabus: Elphane - Aquabus Navia Line I7: Navia Line I7
Each Melusine has their own combination of integument color, hairstyle and garb. The variance of accoutrements seen among Melusines presupposes the variety of jobs or roles they perform in Fontaine.

** Dunyarzad
Overview
When Dunyarzad was a child, she was diagnosed with Eleazar. Her family did their best to give her a comfortable life, but due to her illness, she was unable to leave the house and see the outside world.The Coming of the Sabzeruz Festival The family later ventured into the desert to conduct business, but were ambushed by Eremite bandits that overwhelmed their guard; fortunately, another group of Eremites, led by Kusayla, rescued them and slew the bandits. Through a series of events, Kusayla later had Dehya referred to the Homayani family as a bodyguard once Dunyarzad was diagnosed with Eleazar.
At some point, Dehya began a professional relationship with the Homayani family, and began to live at their estate.The Trail of the God of Wisdom q=Dunyarzad: And every time I bring this up, they just change the subject. Dehya, you've been living with us a long time already. This should be old news to you. According to Dunyarzad, her family began to work with Dehya due to Dehya's "past kindness" to their family.
As an adult, she ran away from home to see the outside world. Her family wanted her to return, and hired Dehya to track her down and help her return home safely. They also put up a missing person poster for her.Diwan Bulletin Board Missing Person Poster However, Dunyarzad convinced Dehya to stop trying to bring her home, hiring her back for only half of what her father was paying Dehya. After returning to the Homayani estate briefly to stage a more effective escape, Dunyarzad was able to return to Sumeru City and fund the Sabzeruz Festival with her own savings.The Trail of the God of Wisdom
After Dunyarzad recovered from her Eleazar, Dehya decided to quit being a bodyguard, something she had always planned to do after Dunyarzad got better. Dehya gave her resignation to Shahzaman and began seeking out more dangerous jobs, though not before traveling to the desert with Dunyarzad.A Toast to Victory</text>

<title>Han Ce</title>
<text>Han Ce zh=寒策 zh_rm=Hán Cè was a member of the Han Family who lived five hundred years ago.
He and Yun Huang are the main characters of the Blackcliff Series weapon descriptions.
Story
Han Ce was the son of famous weaponsmith Han Wu, who was one of the creators of the Prototype Series.
However, Ce had no intention of carrying the family tradition, leading to a rift between him and his father. This changed after he heard about his father's mining incident at The Chasm (Subregion) The Chasm; Ce returned home and found Wu a changed man. After reconciling with his father, Han Ce decided to take up the family business, vowing to never let the forge's fire go out.
Some time later, mysterious earthquakes at The Chasm forced the area to be closed off. When Ce told his father about it, Wu was wracked with guilt, convinced that his mining incident had disturbed the dragon beneath the mines. Wu created Blackcliff Slasher, and Ce built a shrine in the cave to house it to ward off evil.
Around the same time as the earthquakes, the Yun Family, a close associate of the Hans, also suffered from its effects. With the mines closed, the family head Yun Huang struggled to maintain the family business. In order to aid her, Ce crafted the Blackcliff Warbow and presented it to her.
A man claiming to be a thaumaturge paid a visit to Qingce Village where Yun Huang dwelled, asking to meet the craftsmen known by Yun and Han. Huang called Ce over, and the man presented them with a piece of Cor Purum, saying that it was a gift from the thaumaturges for their fathers' creation of Prototype Amber. Using this piece of Cor Purum, they created the Blackcliff Agate.
Several years later, when Wu passed away, the shrine housing Blackcliff Slasher emerged from the cave. Han Ce retrieved the greatsword that night, and the Tianshu of that age engraved an inscription on it.Blackcliff Slasher Lore</text>

Xiao is a yaksha who has fought in the Archon War and holds a high level of seniority among adepti. He has a reserved demeanor and has little intention of getting close to mortals. He does not want sympathy for his past and believes his fellow Yakshas would also find it insulting.The Purging of Evil
He is immensely grateful to Morax for saving him, dedicating his life to protecting Liyue as payment. He does not take lightly to those who speak ill of the Geo Archon regardless of whoever they are. Despite suffering from constant karmic debt, Xiao is highly resilient towards its alluring corruption, as his fellow yaksha have either succumbed or died to it. Due to this debt, he prefers being alone and rarely involves himself in mortal affairs; in the few times he does have to, he asks they get to the point for their own sake.
Xiao is unfamiliar with many human customs and societal norms, often finding them strange, childish, or pointless. To others, he can come off as distant and intimidating. After meeting the Traveler, he becomes slightly more relaxed, willing to learn customs and visit Liyue Harbor with them for their sake despite his reservations with mortal life.Xiao He is also revealed to be a strict yet effective teacher when acting as a mentor figure for Ganyu, but he believes that as a soul-slaughtering yaksha, he is not a suitable teacher for her.
Unlike most of the adepti, Xiao is not particularly fond of most human foods, although he makes exceptions to Almond Tofu and later Grilled Tiger Fish, the former reminding him of the dreams he used to consume and the latter to honor Pervases' memory.

Xiao uses the Medium Male Characters medium male model. He has dark medium-length hair with teal undertones, pale skin, golden irises with avian pupils, and red eyeshadow. Xiao also has a purple diamond marking on his forehead and a green tattoo around his right arm.
Xiao's illuminated beast form has not been seen yet outside of certain stylized merchandise, but it has been teased in his character design, his Alatus Nemeseos constellation, and his yaksha alias Alatus. It is implied that he takes on the form of Garuda, a Hindu demigod, or Peng_(mythology) Peng (a part of his true name in Chinese: 金鹏 'Jīnpéng'), a creature present in both Chinese and Buddhist mythos. Xiao has been called the 'Golden-Winged King,' which may be another reference to the Dapeng Jinchi Mingwang Golden-Winged Great Peng, a guardian deity in Mahayana Buddhism.
In some lines of Genshin Impact merchandise, stylized depictions of Xiao's avian form has been shown. The bird form appears to be a finch-like, though this is inconclusive due to stylization.  Its plumage features multiple shades of teal, reddish eyes and Xiao's purple diamond symbol on its forehead.
Summary
Xiao is an illuminated beast who has lived for over four thousand years. In his youth, he was enslaved by an ancient god who learned his weakness and forced to perform cruel, violent acts on the god's behalf, including devouring the dreams of his victims. The god's bloodthirsty path came to an end at Morax's hand during the Archon War; Xiao was freed and Morax bestowed him with the name "Xiao" for his own protection. Xiao became deeply loyal to the Geo God as a result, a trait that continues to the present day.
When Morax rallied the yakshas to help him suppress the lingering hatred and grudges of fallen gods, Xiao was among those who responded.It is unclear whether yakshas were a pre-existing subset of illuminated beasts, or if these illuminated beasts became collectively referred to as yakshas after responding to Morax's call. Xiao, under the name Alatus, was one of the five foremost Yakshas alongside Bonanus, Bosacius, Indarias, and Menogias.Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti He also fought alongside many other junior yakshas such as Pervases.
However, over the ages, the yakshas' task wore away their numbers: Not only did they have to fight against the lingering power of ancient gods, the hatred that they had to suppress tainted their own souls and mired them in karmic debt, which incurred enormous physical and psychological pain. Between battle casualties, madness, and desertion, the number of yakshas eventually dwindled to Bosacius and Xiao. Bosacius, too, eventually disappeared and left his belongings behind in Minlin,The Yaksha's Wish leaving Xiao as the last Yaksha Guardian. Xiao nearly succumbed to his karmic debt himself at one point, but was saved by the music Venti played during one of the Anemo Archon's visits to Liyue.Story Teaser:
While Xiao's callous exterior can make him appear intimidating, much of his outward personality stems from his reservations about the violent deeds he has performed and the loss of his allies over the course of the years. Deep down, Xiao is a gentle soul who is curious about humanity, but is hesitant to show that side of himself due to his past experiences and his karma-ridden constitution.HoYoLAB:
Due to the nature of his work, Xiao typically avoids humans. Not only does he think his bloody past makes him incapable of fitting in,Light Upon the Sea human souls are less robust than adepti's and his karmic debt taints his surroundings. As a result, few people even in Liyue know much about him or his role in protecting Liyue. Those who do know, as well as other adepti, call him the Conqueror of Demons zh=降魔大圣 zh_rm=Xiángmó Dàshèng zh_tl=Great Sage who Subdues Demons out of respect.
The Liyue Qixing built the Wangshu Inn at Dihua Marsh, run by their agents Verr Goldet and Huai'an, to give Xiao a place to stay and rest as he carries out his duty. He appears to get along relatively well with the two agents: He entrusted Dusky Ming to them,Wangshu while they cover for his unintended destructive tendenciesIn the Commissions 'Business in a Marsh' and 'Guest from Afar', the "young gentleman" Huai'an and Verr Goldet refer to is Xiao. The "guests" that break things around the inn when night sets in really refers to Xiao; while purging demons, the power he releases affects the inn as well. and express their concern for him during Lantern Rite.The Origin of the Lanterns
In the Traveler's presence, Xiao is more willing to indulge his curiosity about humanity, even if their ways perplex him, and offers to visit Liyue Harbor with the Traveler for the purposes of bonding and learning. With Liyue's citizens beginning to self-govern and other adepti withdrawing their presence, Xiao continues defending Liyue and also makes more attempts to understand the people.
Official Introduction
Xiao:On His Majesty's Sacred Service: The Conqueror of Demons
By honoring his oath as a yaksha, one hopes that our fellow adeptus has now finally gained some respite from the grievances that have burdened him all these millennia.
The people of Liyue Harbor greatly revere the mighty and illuminated adepti who dwell in Jueyun Karst.
During the festival seasons, they will offer up incense and pray to the adepti for their protection.
But none pray to Xiao.
For Xiao is no lucky star that promises fame and fortune - he is a demon-hunting Yaksha.
After the lantern lights of Liyue have faded, the thankless battle to protect the city goes on unseen. It is an endless battle, and there can be no victor.
Still, none of this fazes Xiao, for as the Vigilant Yaksha, he must protect Liyue to honor his contract.
This is simply the way it is.
Character Stories
Xiao may have the appearance of a young man, but his true age is something over two thousand years.Fortunately, people do not tend to underestimate him on the basis of his appearance - one only needs to spend a short time with Xiao to clarify that he is not someone to be trifled with.Xiao is a man of few words. He is highly dangerous, and has the most piercing gaze you've ever seen.He enjoys a formidable reputation and high level of seniority among the adepti, but is relatively unknown in the mortal realm.This is inevitable. Xiao is not one of those popular deities to whom people pray for wealth and protection, nor is he a mystical sage of Jueyun Karst to whom pilgrims flock in search of divine wisdom.No... If any mortal witnesses Xiao unleashing his true power, it is certain to be under the direst of circumstances - and they will be extremely lucky if they survive the ordeal.This is not because Xiao seeks to harm people. Rather, since Xiao wages a constant war against dark forces powerful enough to devour Liyue in its entirety, any bystanders who witness him in the heat of battle are likely to end up as collateral damage.Not that this is a secret worth going around silencing witnesses for.
What exactly is Xiao wrestling with?The tactful answer would be old grudges, unfulfilled dreams, the lamentations of the vanquished...The unmitigated truth is that Xiao fights against the remnants of the defeated gods from the Archon War, which took place prior to the rise of The Seven.Morax defeated those gods and buried their remains beneath the rocks of the earth.However, gods are immortal. Their consciousness may diminish, but their power and hatred will always remain and spread like poison, relentlessly stirring up chaos for the world and its inhabitants.Liyue's rulers, who are aware of the truth regarding Xiao, refer to him in his millennia-long experience as the "Bane of All Evil." The war he fights can never be won, and will never come to an end.It is also an invisible war that no one will ever witness or thank him for.
. There is no significant difference between the two phrases in Chinese (they directly translate as "God of Rock" and "Rock God," respectively), but it lends to confusion in the English translation as the terms "god" and "Archon" are not completely interchangeable. had a fateful encounter with the yaksha's master.The current state of the world has already revealed the results of that battle.Rex Lapis liberated the yaksha and gave him the name "Xiao." "In the fables of another land, the name Xiao is that of a spirit who encountered great suffering and hardship. He endured much suffering, as you have. Use this name from now on."
To repay his debt of gratitude to the Geo Archon, Xiao shouldered the burden of protecting Liyue in the millennia that followed.His past of service under the evil god had rid Xiao of his innocence and gentleness. All that remained within him was the means to kill and the weight of his sins.The only way he could be of service to mortals was in doing battle.But what could people do for him in return?No ordinary person would ever stop to ask such a question. The sight of Xiao, even far off in the distance, was intimidating enough to send people instantly running for their lives.That said... if ever someone did want to show some appreciation for Xiao, there is perhaps one thing they could try.There is a certain Verr Goldet secret agent of the Qixing who is tasked with supporting Xiao in subduing demons. That secret agent runs a front organization called the Wangshu Inn.Occasionally, Xiao stops by the inn for a bowl of Almond Tofu, and if you could see the look on his face when he eats it... there's no mistaking it - he clearly loves the stuff.Nonetheless, it is not the sweet taste that Xiao hankers after. It's the texture he finds irresistible - apparently, it's very similar to that of the dreams he used to devour.
What exactly is Xiao wrestling with?To those in Liyue's corridors of power, Xiao's battle is against the evil manifestations produced by the remnants of defeated gods.However, if you asked Xiao the same question, he may well give you an entirely different answer.Xiao was once enslaved by an evil god and suffered immensely under his rule until finally regaining his freedom at Rex Lapis' hand.Xiao's powers were highly regarded by the adepti and he seemed to vanquish all manner of evil demons with consummate ease.But the evil gods also held immense power, and their lust for revenge ran deeper than mere mortals could ever contemplate. Xiao relentlessly slaughtered the endless, impure manifestations of their vengeful souls, but in doing so, he caused them to fracture. Eventually, these fragments of their hatred were able to taint Xiao's own soul.The only way to eradicate such hatred is to accept the karmic debt it brings. The magnitude of the bad karma Xiao has accumulated over the years is enough to consume flesh, bone, and soul alike.And yet, Xiao does not feel any hatred. Having lived for over two thousand years, no single karmic debt constitutes anything more than a fleeting memory.No grudge can last a thousand years, nor is any debt so great that it cannot be paid off in this time.Xiao has spent many long years alone.But his battles have never been in vain.Because ultimately, the one with whom Xiao wrestles is himself.
What does Xiao fight against?The Traveler understands very well that Xiao fights against the darkness that threatens Liyue. He fights to defend Liyue.But who will defend him?There was once when most of Xiao's strength was spent fighting from dusk till dawn, with him emerging victorious by a mere hair.The reeds in the fields had been sliced to ribbons in the fierce fighting. Plucking his spear from where it had been planted in the ground, Xiao began the trek home.Well, one says "home" - yet, where did Xiao have to return to? He was merely leaving the battlefield.Long exhausted, Xiao felt the divine hatred that tainted his body take effect.Limitless hate flooded his senses, and he fell to the ground in agony.But it was also at that moment that the pain vanished without warning.This was not by Xiao's own strength, for he had been rescued by the sound of a flute.The clear, lovely sound of the flute came over the mountains and rivers, carried on the wind to where he lay.And clear it continued to ring till the first light of dawn brought with it the startled flight of distant birds.It protected Xiao, massaging his wild senses, and giving him a moment's peace.Who was playing this music? Xiao was curious but did not pursue the matter. For he already had something approaching an answer.The last person who could help him was one of The Seven themselves. So this person, too, must be-
A scholar of the Sumeru Akademiya once did folklore studies in Liyue, the result of which was a book called "Tour of the Land of Liyue," with separate editions being available in Sumeru and Liyue."Hidden Diamond and Cloudy Moon: Wonders and Folklores of Liyue" is the version available in Liyue, and has had many mystical and magical portions removed.The "Ode to Windborne Wraith" is one of the mystical chapters that remain recorded within the complete version at the Akademiya.The document mentions that though the yaksha were mighty and upright among the adepti, they were bound by their own karma to suffer great horrors and tribulations. As such, they wandered the land in a state of unending suffering.The chapter lists many methods of comforting the yaksha, such as food offerings, holy chants, and the like. These would appease the yaksha and help them to continue defending the peace.As noble warriors among adepti, the yaksha would often descend upon the battlefield in person. However, as conflicts grew over the millennia, they have almost been wiped out. Today, large statues of the yaksha subduing demons remain within Liyue's borders, but they have had their features destroyed.By the by, the language used in that text was so meandering, and its contents so dense, that it sold far fewer copies than the Teyvat Travel Guide and the international cultural summaries written by El Musk.
All adepti are known as the "mighty and illuminated" adepti, and this "illumination" refers to the light of a third "eye" that they possess: a Vision.But do adepti receive their Visions as a form of acknowledgment from Celestia, like humans do?Xiao no longer remembers the moment he received his Vision. To humans, this would be an unforgettable event. But for him, this was just the beginning of his endless battle.The thing that Xiao truly cannot forget is something different.There are a great many human festivals, and few remember the stories behind them.The greater part of these days coincide with occasions where man-eating monsters were defeated by the adepti host. People imitated their deeds and staged exorcism rituals to remember their ancient heroism, with these practices eventually evolving into celebratory festivals.The hatred and residual might of many of the gods defeated by Morax throughout Liyue will sometimes erupt with abnormal force amid their half-awake, half-dreaming state. Among them, the eruption that takes place during the Lantern Rite is the most extreme in scale.Xiao has his mission to perform the time-honored "Nuo Dance of Evil Conquering," and so he fights night and day during the Lantern Rite. Thus, he has come to hate it.Now, Xiao did not consider battle dangerous. It was due to his hard work that Liyue was kept safe. People lit their lanterns, and the blessed lights shone across the night sky and the nearshore.At that moment, another special feeling blossomed in Xiao's heart. Loneliness? Peace? Or was it his fears for the future? The young-seeming adeptus searched his heart, only to find no answers.

<title>Takamine the Mistsplitter</title>
<text>Takamine the Mistsplitter ja=霧切高嶺 ja_rm=Kirigiri Takamine,According to Hibiki's narration in Hamayumi, Takamine was his surname. He has not been referred to by his first name. nicknamed "Konbumaru" ja=昆布丸, was a famous martial artist in Inazuma who lived five hundred years ago.Mistsplitter ReforgedA Nazuchi Beach Pirate's Diary  4 Pirate's Diary on Nazuchi Beach, written by present-day pirates, states that Ako Domeki lived five hundred years ago. In Hamayumi, which is set some time after Takamine's disappearance/death, Hibiki offers Domeki her assistance. As a result, Takamine lived around that same time period.
He was Asase Hibiki's love interest, although he married a high-ranking samurai's daughter after becoming the Electro Archon Raiden Shogun's Hatamoto.Storm Cage Despite later entrusting his bow to Hibiki and wagering his "future" on it, they would never come to see this future - in battle against the dark forces during the cataclysm, Takamine was overwhelmed and disappeared.Shimenawa's Reminiscence
Takamine was the wielder of Mistsplitter Reforged and Thundering Pulse.
Profile
Story
In Takamine's youth, he was wandering around Mt. Yougou when he came across the Great Tengu Reizenbou and made a wager with her. The contest ended in a draw with three wins and three losses; Takamine temporarily became the Tengu's servant in exchange for gaining ownership over Thundering Pulse, a bow gifted by the Raiden Shogun.Thundering Pulse He followed her to the Grand Narukami Shrine where the Kitsune Saiguu, the subject of the great Tengu's protection,Hakushin Ring resided, and there he met The Yougou Three, including Hibiki. Takamine and Hibiki grew close, a matter which the Kitsune Saiguu enjoyed teasing her over.
During his servitude to the Tengu, he learned some of her archery and swordplay. Despite priding himself in both fields, he was much more renowned for his skill with his blade. Finding it a shame that his Tengu archery was going to waste, he taught it to Hibiki.
After his period of servitude ended, Takamine gained Baal's recognition thanks to a recommendation letter from his master and became a Hatamoto. Likely as a result of his station, Takamine later married a high-ranking samurai's daughter. Despite this, he hadn't lost his gambling and wandering habits, which Hibiki scolded him for.
The Cataclysm and Death
When the cataclysm struck, Takamine was among those who accompanied Baal on her campaign to the abyss to against the dark forces. Chiyo of the Mikoshi Clan, Baal's Lieutenant, also participated.Weapon Ascension Material: Mask of the One-Horned and Mask of the Kijin'He [Torachiyo] was once a beloved lieutenant of the Shogun, and he followed her into the dark abyssal realms to repel the defiled ones [...]'; Mask of the Kijin reveals that the story of "Torachiyo" is actually Chiyo's story, distorted over time. The Kitsune Saiguu also fell victim to the dark disaster,Yougou Cleansing although it is unclear whether she personally participated in the campaign.
During the conflict, Takamine was separated from the rest and fought against the dark forces alone. Because he left Thundering Pulse with Hibiki as his wager for his successful return, he had only his Mistsplitter to rely on in battle. After the sword broke, he was overwhelmed and failed to resurface even after the events of the cataclysm ended. Many years later, Takamine finally emerged from the abyss, only to be pierced and presumably killed by Hibiki's arrows upon reuniting with her. It appears that she viewed her act as "saving" him.Shaft of Remembrance It was later revealed by Yae Miko that what returned to Inazuma was not Takamine himself, but the darkened remains of his soul and it was necessary to wipe him out to protect Inazuma.Kagura's Verity
Legacy
Takamine is still remembered in a popular Inazuman folk song: "Arataki of the Front Gate, Iwakura Michihiro Iwakura the Successor, Kitain Bunsou Kitain the Serpent, Takamine the Mistsplitter."
After Hibiki returned to Asase Shrine, she often spoke fondly of Takamine to Neko, although she usually referred to him as "Konbumaru." As a result, Neko interpreted the name to have a positive connotation, and has named a cat "Konbumaru" once per generation ever since.Neko Is a Cat: The Children
During Ako Domeki's rebellion against the Shogunate, his mannerisms and manner of speech reminded Hibiki of Takamine, so she offered him her assistance. Even though he rejected her, she decided to use the "true 'magic'" she learned from the Yougou Tengu to undo a certain seal and use it to wreak havoc on the Shogunate fleet to aid his cause and protect him.Hamayumi

<title>Baizhu's Master</title>
<text>Baizhu's master was a doctor in Liyue who lived in Chenyu Vale. He was the younger brother of Old Hu, Hu Tao's grandfather, making him Hu Tao's great-uncle.
Profile
Baizhu's master was a member of the Hu Family and was once a member of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. He was the most recent doctor in a line of doctors who bore Changsheng's "Way of the Dragon-Dragging Jade Snake" contract before the current bearer, Baizhu.
Appearance
Baizhu's master had physical features resembling his great-niece Hu Tao, sporting short brown hair and red eyes,His original eye color can be deduced by the appearance of Chansheng's eyes in the cutscene that plays during the act 'The Formula for a Miracle'. though during the duration of his contract with Changsheng he had her golden snake eyes. He wore brown clothing similar to that worn by the undertakers of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor with a white coat on top.  He also wore a monocle.
Story
When he was younger, Baizhu's master traveled to Chenyu Vale with his brother, at which they would meet a pharmacist. After that encounter, Baizhu's master announced that he wanted to leave the family business to practice medicine, sparking an argument with his older brother.  Failing to convince him to stay, the two fell out and never spoke to each other again.The Search for a Physician Baizhu's master would go on to become the successor to Changsheng's "Way of the Dragon-Dragging Jade Snake" contract. Like those who bore the contract before him, he was incredibly selfless and did not prioritize his own well-being, opting to frequently use Changsheng's powers to exchange his life force with his patients.
At some point, he took on Jiangli as a disciple.The Quest for a Cure
While Baizhu was still young, his master was practicing medicine in his hometown when a plague suddenly struck. Although able to contain the spread, Baizhu's parents passed away during the plague. Having lost both his parents, Baizhu began to follow his master in learning medicine.
Not long after taking on Baizhu as a disciple, Jiangli left their master to treat her husband, Jialiang, distancing herself from her master to keep him from using his life force to save him.The Formula for a Miracle Saving Jialiang would become his dying wish.The Search for a Physician
Eventually, like those who bore Changsheng's contract before him, Baizhu's master ended up dying at a young age, passing on the contract to Baizhu.
Legacy
The loss of his master combined with the cruel reality of the fate borne by both Changsheng and her hosts is what caused Baizhu to pursue immortality, hoping to be the final bearer of the contract that had taken the lives of so many doctors before him; those whom Baizhu considers "least deserving of death". This resolve became the catalyst for Baizhu receiving his Vision, appearing on his master's grave when he vowed that the contract would end with him.
Baizhu's research on Qiqi allowed him to turn Jialiang into a zombie after dying, somewhat fulfilling his master's dying wish to save him.

<title>Haravatat</title>
<text>Haravatat is one of the Sumeru Akademiya The Six Darshans Six Darshans, the six main schools of Sumeru Akademiya.
It is specialized in semiotics,Opening Festivities the study of sign processes and meaning-making, and includes disciplines such as linguistics and ancient runes studies.HosseiniSitt
Their recognized color is black and its sage is Khajeh. The mascot on their symbol resembles a bull.
Haravatat is currently the Darshan with the lowest enrollment numbers.
Overview
For example, my Darshan, Haravatat, focuses on linguistics, but we seldom discuss literature. Instead, we spend a lot of time studying syntax and structure.
Amongst the Six Darshans, Haravatat's focus on semiotics involves it in the study of ancient languages. Due to this overlap in studies with Vahumana, which focuses on history, its members occasionally argue on the best way to approach the study of history. Based on Khaldun and Yavanani's debates, those from Vahumana view Haravatat's approach as "tunnel-visioning," while Haravatat believes that Vahumana's approach of trying to find universal rules that determine all events in history "[puts] the cart before the horse."Khaldun Members of the Rtawahist Darshan, such as Hawa, also sometimes dabble into the study of ancient runes, although Hawa comes from a lineage of scholars and may have gained some knowledge from outside her Darshan.Hawa
One of the languages studied in Haravatat is the ancient King Deshret script.Secret of the Scorching Desert
According to Alhaitham, a member of Haravatat, every student is required to study at least twenty languages before graduation, though this is later revealed to be a former policy.Receiver of Friends From Afar: Part II
Haravatat's research has shifted over the last century from the study of machine mechanisms and analyzing the ancient structures of ruin devices using various ancient texts to the study of language itself, with the former becoming a niche within their Darshan as Kshahrewar matured as the Darshan of Technology and advanced beyond Haravatat's findings. This has led to the dismissal of the 100 years time-shifted Haravatat researcher Faruzan, who was once highly regarded in her field for her contributions to the study of ancient ruins, research that was once considered invaluable to the Haravatat but has since been deemed obsolete in their Darshan, finding more use in Kshahrewar, which used her research to establish the fundamentals of the study of mechanisms.</text>

Story
Born to a great family, she served the then-Divine Priestess of the Sangonomiya Clan from the young age and became her entrusted shrine maiden by the time when the war with the Raiden Shogun was about to begin. Then, given an order by the priestess to assemble the first navy of the island, she spent three days to persuade the great whale Daikengyou to be allied with the Watatsumi Island.
At some point in the history, the twin sisters Mouun and Ayame the Umigozen mentored an unnamed boy, who would later become Touzannou (also later known as Akuou), the champion of the serpent god Orobashi.Debates on the "Viceroy of the East" Touzannou learned whalesongs and rituals from the sisters, but it was one beautiful night when he swam with Mouun that inspired him to develop two famed sword arts. He seems to have had romantic feelings toward his mentor, and Getsumouun ("Moon Mouun"), the name of one of the two arts, may be his tribute to Mouun.
After the war with the Raiden Shogun began, Orobashi, and the army of Touzannou embarked on the Yashiori Island, while Mouun and Ayame led the navy with Daikengyou.Mouun's Moon Following fierce battles, they successfully slayed the tengu Sasayuri, a general cherished by the shogun.Sangonomiya Chronicles However, Musou no Hitotachi, the signature sword art of the shogun, severed Orobashi and Touzannou together just with one slash, creating a huge gap now known as the Musoujin Gorge.
Upon hearing the deaths of her god and student, she and Daikengyou tried to retreat but were killed by an ambush by the subordinates of Sasayuri. Their bodies were captured by the Bakufu. Her sister Ayame the Umigozen also disappeared into the sea.
Even after many years passed, the people of Watatsumi Island still sing the deeds of Mouun in folk-tunes. The Mouun Shrine on the island may be dedicated to honor her memory.

At a tavern in Sumeru City, a disheveled member of The Eremites exclaimed in fear.
The guardian with different-colored eyes has received the blessing of the gods and is able to summon a sandstorm that engulfs all enemies instantly.
A former member of the Treasure Hoarders, who recently claimed to have quit, added that Candace can also summon the power of the desert. Every grain of sand is her scout and no one can escape from her grasp.
But a young adventurer who was about to leave for the desert looked surprised. He replied that Miss Candace, the guardian of Aaru Village, was actually a gentle and caring person.
During a visit to Aaru Village, he had seen Miss Candace bring water and food to a hungry Treasure Hoarder, and arranged for another exhausted mercenary to rest in the guest room... In the eyes of this adventurer, "terrifying" is the last word one could use to describe this guardian...
Candace, who is far away in the Great Red Sand, was unaware of this little debate about her - although she doesn't mind what people think about her.
As the guardian of Aaru Village, it is her duty to protect the peace of the village.
As long as they abide by the rules of Aaru Village, anyone can seek refuge here and receive the help they need.
As for those who violate the rules and commit atrocities in the village...
Candace will personally ensure that they never harm the village again.
Character Stories
Candace, who has heterochromatic eyes, serves as the guardian of Aaru Village.Candace always shows the greatest kindness to all travelers visiting the village, and she will not pursue an inadvertent faux pas so long as that person corrects themselves in time. In Candace's view, the village rules are the most important thing. So long as these boundaries are respected, anyone can be allowed to rest in Aaru Village.But woe betide those who regard this tolerance as weakness. Those who try to do anything illegal in Aaru Village will definitely pay the price.By then, they will find that Candace's lance and shield truly are the most frightening of weapons.The scion of King Deshret Al-Ahmar, a member of desert folk, the Guardian... Candace, burdened as she is with multiple identities, also bears the eternal responsibility of guarding Aaru Village."This village only welcomes those who can follow the rules."
"Aaru Village is the final refuge for King Deshret's descendants." "The mission of the Aaru Village's Guardian is to guard the village till the last of King Deshret's people fade away."When Candace was officially appointed as the new "Guardian" at the tender age of eight, the one who handed the position over to her admonished her as such.With King Deshret's death, it was already a blessing that his descendants might have such a refuge from the world.And so, generation after generation, the Guardians take up their duties in silence, defending countless villagers until they pass on as the "descendants of King Deshret" and gain eternal peace.It was once the common wish of the residents of Aaru Village to fade away in peace, sequestered in their village.However, when new life emerges in this ancient village... Everything that they used to know might just have to change a bit.
When Uncle Anpu, the village head, announced that a caravan from Sumeru City was about to arrive in the village for trade, the former Guardians could hardly believe their ears.They indignantly accused Uncle Anpu of undermining tradition and requested that Candace, the current Guardian, do her duty by summoning guards to drive the merchants out.However, Candace refused the request, for she had already reached an agreement with the village head that the village must make changes for the future of its residents.They kept explaining, but the former keepers did not relent, and it was even suggested that if Candace was unwilling to do her duty, they would take up arms again and carry out a Guardian's work themselves. At last, a clang of lance against shield silenced all the quarrels. With lance and shield in her hand, Candace stood up and looked around with a smile, before announcing to the stunned elderly folks around her:"It is good to see you all in such good spirits.""But I am the current Guardian of Aaru Village, so please, go and rest, as you should."The persuasive power of weapons trumped words at this moment, and it seemed that it would be enough to end the fracas.After a moment's preparation, Candace accompanied the village head in her station as Guardian to formally receive the caravan and hold trade negotiations with them, before personally escorting them out of the village.A few days later, the merchants visited again and completed this seemingly humble transaction regarding cloths.This batch of merchants returned to Sumeru City with news of the success of the deal. Soon after, a new topic cropped up among the business-folk of Sumeru, one which had been rarely heard of in the past:"Hey, you know what? Someone went to Aaru Village to do business - and they made a good sum of Mora, too. Think we should give it a shot next time...?"
In truth, Candace doesn't often use her lance and shield as debating tools.The children in Aaru Village have always believed that "Big Sis Candace" will only frown no matter how angry she is - at most, she might ask the children in trouble to copy the calligraphy prepared for them by Kulsoom Grandma Kulsoom several times.The other guards in Aaru Village believe that although Candace's requirements are strict, she will not give out corporal punishment to those who slack off or whose physical abilities are not up to par, and that she will simply guide them with more care instead.The older folks in the village, for their period, note that Candace is a person who will not let negative emotions show on her face, and indeed, she has never once looked sad in front of them.Even the merchants who visit the village will be received by Candace with the utmost hospitality. From introductions to accommodations, she arranges everything in good order.Perhaps she might even be too gentle for the merchants' comfort.After all, this village is next to Great Red Sand. Leaving the monsters aside, lawless bandits must have long had this village in their sights.Is the Guardian truly capable of protecting everyone... and their business as well?One night, a drunken merchant dared to ask:"Guardian, we can do business in this village, no problem. But as you know, this desert is a real den of outlaws...""You need not worry about this. Only those who obey the rules shall be guests in Aaru Village. As for those who don't..."
Those who do not respect the rules shall be the "enemies" of Aaru Village.Whether they be Eremites hiding in the sands, bandits disguised as adventurers, or Treasure Hoarders attempting to steal goods...Anyone who dares to invade the village, no matter how they may try to hide and escape, will eventually receive the punishment they deserve.Those who sincerely confess their guilt will be forgiven and given enough supplies to cross the sands, but never again will they be permitted to show their faces around Aaru Village.As for the more recalcitrant sort...Their despicable souls shall find company only with the desert sands.A former member of The Eremites once warned his companions that Candace, the terrifying Guardian of the village, is a true descendant of King Deshret.The shield in her hand possesses the blessing of Al-Ahmar, such that as long as its wielder holds it tightly, every grain in the great desert will heed her call. So if Candace so wishes, she could even send forth a huge sandstorm to engulf all her foes.Not only that, her amber left eye can also perceive the future and read the fates of others. Indeed, such is her terrible might that none can ever escape her pursuit.Such are people's beliefs concerning Candance, that she has swept all of Aaru Village's enemies away by virtue of these divine powers.
Only Candace herself knows that she has never really felt the blessing of Al-Ahmar."The Guardians have never been blessed by the grace of god" - this is a secret handed down from Guardian to Guardian.Only when a new Guardian takes up their shield will they be told the truth.The effects of the truth on those now in the know has varied. Some gave up and became so despondent that they stopped practicing martial arts. Some came to believe that since they were not being watched, they didn't have to obey the rules either, and so acted recklessly, even in violation of the law.But Candace was not depressed."My lance and shield are not wielded as a prayer for a god's blessing.""My duty will not change, regardless of whether any god favors us or not."She practices diligently day after day and through this has forged both an extraordinary will and martial skills.Many who have visited Aaru Village have extended invitations to Candace, wondering why someone as capable as her would choose to live in such an inconspicuous place. If she was willing to leave, they often say, she may yet be able to start a new career...Yet Candace always answers them thusly:"A Guardian will not leave what they have purposed to protect."
Candace often buys all kinds of trinkets from merchants who visit Aaru Village.Hairpins adorned with aquamarine beads, headbands made of silk and satin, gilded necklaces, metal bracelets engraved with Kalpalata Lotus patterns, pendants with the emblems of Sumeru Akademiya the Akademiya's colleges drawn upon them...While Dehya has encouraged her to dress up more often and use the Mora she spends on herself, Candace feels that some things are too fragile to survive her daily work environment, and so she puts them deep in her wardrobe.So it seems that these trinkets will come in handy only when Candace temporarily puts her duties aside and changes into other clothes to have a rest in the shade - or perhaps she might just give it to a friend as a gift.
With outsiders pouring in, Aaru Village was faced with a variety of unprecedented circumstances.They now had Treasure Hoarders pretending to be businessmen within the village, mercenary groups hijacking trade caravans, unscrupulous vendors engaged in charlatanry...Moreover, after seeing people who came from abroad, the residents of Aaru Village gradually began to yearn for life outside. Gradually, people tried to go out to make a living, and fewer and fewer young people were willing to stay in the village.The former Guardians had long been dissatisfied with Candace, who, as they saw it, had "abandoned" their traditions. Seeing that the village was in such a situation, they again held a meeting and prepared to challenge her."What we Guardians must do is maintain order in the village!""Candace! What you have done will only cost this village its peace!""Candace! Go and fulfill your duties now!"As the war of words swayed back and forth, the lance-wielding female warrior suddenly shot up to her full height."That's enough!""If you only wish to protect the 'past' of this village, then do it yourself! Whether you wish to just remain in your homes or leave Aaru Village, that is up to you!""I will not let the people of Aaru Village be bound by the past forever.""If you can't move forward, then it's up to me to protect our future!"The old Guardians were intimidated by her, her young, fiery eyes making it impossible for them to come forward and question her further.Burning with rare anger, Candace hefted her long spear and stormed out of the dispute-ridden hut.And, as if in response to her convictions, a shining "jewel" had appeared at the tip of that lance, though she knew not when it had done so.The eyes of the gods had found her, and they had given her their approval.A "Vision" is also a resolute heart - and no finer ornament than it may be found anywhere.

<title>Old Blind Poet</title>
<text>The old blind poet, also known as the vassal kings' retainer or some combination thereof, was a historical figure in the Great Red Sand, Sumeru who lived during the warring city-states era after King Deshret's death several thousand years ago. He survived many characters of the time period, and lived to tell their tales (including in the descriptions of the Desert Pavilion Chronicle artifacts).
Story
The blind poet was a native of Tulaytullah, the city of sapphires, which in his youth had been the most powerful city-state in the desert.Beacon of the Reed Sea He was of privileged status and well-educated, and he went on to serve in the court of Badanah as a loyal general who aided Badanah in conquering numerous cities of the desert. The poet was present when Badanah's son Faramarz was born, and gave the prince his blessing; using his skills as a poet, he also wrote "hymns for [Badanah] and love poems for [Faramarz]." Even many years later, after Tulaytullah's decline, he still harbored faith in Faramarz. The poet also knew of Makhaira, a dancer and concubine of Badanah.End of the Golden RealmKey of Khaj-Nisut
The poet lived through the end of Badanah's reign, and the strife that followed. Makhaira harbored resentment against the court of Tulaytullah for destroying her homeland, and she managed to win Faramarz to her side, convincing him his father would cause Tulaytullah's destruction. The two conspired to assassinate Badanah and disguise his death as an accident, causing him to fall to his death from a hunting tower. Nominally, Faramarz inherited the throne with Makhaira as his queen regent. However, due to the new king's youth, Makhaira and the retainers (the poet being one of them) held the actual power over matters of state. What followed was a long, bloody stream of infighting as Badanah's brothers variously rose up to seize power, during which time the society of Tulaytullah crumbled into a state of slave-soldiers fighting on behalf of the royal city, and Faramarz was exiled and restored twice. No longer trusting Makhaira,Lamp of the Lost Faramarz poisoned her to death before another conspiracy between the slave-warriors and city-dwellers led to his third exile, this time for good.Interactable, Vaguely-Readable Inscription, Primal Obelisk Khaj-Nisut Khaj-NisutTulaytullah's Remembrance
Sometime during this period, the poet was blinded, possibly by Faramarz himself,Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, Primal Obelisk Mausoleum of King Deshret, Center Mausoleum of King Deshret, Center and lost his status, becoming a mere wanderer. He remained knowledgeable about the history of the desert and the news of his kingdom's decline, seeking to preserve his people's stories.Makhaira Aquamarine He was left with no support but a single slave warrior, a young man named Xiphos who had become "apprenticed" to him. Xiphos was a fallen noble from a conquered kingdom; he eventually revealed his story to his master, who realized that Xiphos possessed the Key of Khaj-Nisut, which legends held to be the key to the Khaj-Nisut eternal paradise prophesied by King Deshret. The poet encouraged Xiphos to embark on a journey across the city-states in the desert and reach his destiny of reuniting the desert peoples.Tulaytullah's Remembrance states that Xiphos was already the Blade of Tulaytullah before Makhaira was sent to become Badanah's concubine. This would seem to conflict with other sources, such as Makhaira Aquamarine, End of the Golden Realm, and Beacon of the Reed Sea, which suggest that the poet was blinded following Badanah's assassination, only after which he met Xiphos and encouraged him to fulfill his destiny, which led to Xiphos becoming the hero of Tulaytullah. It is possible Xiphos was already a hero of Tulaytullah but did not become widely known across the desert until the poet encouraged him. Before they parted ways, the poet told Xiphos all he knew about the history of their civilization, from the legend of Deshret creating the The Orchard of Pairidaeza Eternal Oasis to the destruction of Gurabad, Deshret's death, and the beginning of the city-states.Desert Pavilion Chronicle
In the end, the poet grew weary of the constant bloodshed. In his wanderings, he learned of Xiphos' death, Faramarz's escape to the Dharma Forest rainforest, and his homeland's demise, as well as the collapses of many other desert kingdoms. With these stories and more kept recorded in his memory, the poet — and other refugees from the desert, also wishing for better lives — decided to leave and travel east. The poet left a carving on an obelisk underneath the Mausoleum of King Deshret, voicing their intention to leave behind the rule of kings and create Aaru Village a new home on the edge of the desert, named Aaru in memory of Deshret's promised land, where they would preserve the embers of their civilization and quietly await King Deshret's return. The poet himself would ultimately leave to continue traveling east, into the forest.Wandering Evenstar His fate afterwards is left unrecorded.

<title>Venti/Lore</title>
<text>A bard that seems to have arrived on some unknown wind - sometimes sings songs as old as the hills, and other times sings poems fresh and new.Likes apples and lively places but is not a fan of cheese or anything sticky.When using his Anemo power to control the wind, it often appears as feathers, as he's fond of that which appears light and breezy.
Personality
One of the many bards of Mondstadt, who freely wanders the city's streets and alleys.
Venti has a somewhat recalcitrant, carefree, and playful attitude as well as a liking to rhyming in his speech. He sees a particular worth in music to the point where he names his lyre, saying, "every being deserves a name to be called upon, and woven into a song." He is also bold, not fearing to insult or ignore those who are supposedly powerful. In the game, he responds to Paimon's comments and nicknaming by parroting her.
Venti enjoys roaming around Mondstadt playing songs to his people, most of whom are unaware of his true identity as Barbatos. He is very well-liked due to his musical talent, having won the title "Most Popular Bard of Mondstadt" three times.That Green Fellow He is also an avid drinker of alcoholic beverages, such as Dandelion Wine and has an unusually high tolerance to alcohol. He is also fine with apple cider. To his disdain, the form he takes causes most bartenders to see him as a minor.
Being a god who is generally absent for prolonged periods of time, Venti has no personal finances; he often resorts to pilfering from the Dawn Winery for food and shamelessly has people listening to his songs buy him drinks in lieu of a payment. For reasons unknown, he is deathly allergic to cats and will not perform unless he is certain none are nearby.
He also enjoys apples, considering them to be the fruit of the gods, jokingly stating that he would refuse to go to Celestia even if he was invited because their apples are bland and the water foul, which would make bad cider. He dislikes items that are sticky and slimy, such as cheese.
Despite his normally playful personality as the bard Venti, he speaks wisely and somewhat philosophically whenever he assumes his true identity due to the many experiences he had being one of the original members of The Seven. Compared to Zhongli, the mortal vessel of Morax, Venti does not mind revealing his identity and using his powers for various tasks.
For all his cheer and wisdom, Venti hides a lonely soul who, even millennia later, continues to feel strongly about the loss of the Bard whose form he imitates and even compares himself to "Stanley" for he too assumed the Nameless Bard appearance of his deceased friend, and tells the Traveler that it is in the most innoccous moments are those in which he suddenly is hit by his grief.
Venti also confesses to finding the Traveler's ability to discern what he's thinking as discomforting, but admits that he appreciates having a true friend, similar to how he views the Bard.
Appearance
Breezy Ode
Venti uses the Medium Male Characters medium male model. He has fair skin, aqua green eyes, and short black-ish blue hair with short twin braids at the sides of his face that fade into aqua blue. The tips glow in Anemo-aqua color when he uses his Elemental Skill or Elemental Burst.
His form is modeled after the Nameless Bard, a friend who perished in the rebellion to liberate Decarabian's Mondstadt from Decarabian's rule 2600 years ago. In addition to using this form as an ordinary Mondstadter, he also uses it when appearing as an Archon, as seen in his Statues of The Seven, the Anemo Archon Statue in front of the Favonius Cathedral, and the manga.
The "Vision" on his hip behaves like other characters' Visions in most gameplay; however, in reality, it is only "a glass ball [he carries] around to avoid suspicion,"Ending Note and there are a select few gameplay mechanics that reflect this. His Vision can also be seen turning into "Der Frühling," a wooden lyre with Cecilias and blue strings imbued with the power of Anemo.

Character Stories
An unknown bard that came from nowhere. He sometimes sings outdated songs, other times he hums new ones that none have ever heard of.He likes apples and lively atmospheres, but hates cheese and anything that is slimy.When channeling Anemo, it appears in the form of feathers, because he likes things that look light.
Back when traveling bard Venti had only been in Mondstadt for a few months, his income was far less than the other more established bards in town. But once he had a few Mora in the pot from his performance, you could be sure he would hurry off to spend it at the same place every time - one of the city's taverns.Unfortunately for Venti, his childlike appearance meant that his attempts to acquire alcohol failed at every turn.The first time he was refused service, he was heard grumbling: "I'm sure there were no such preposterous regulations last time I was here..." Once he realized that the same rule applied to all taverns in town, he decided he would have to change his approach...The strategy he developed was drinking on the job - that is to say, playing the lyre while holding a wine cup in his mouth, urging his audience to buy him a drink from the bar if they liked his performances instead of giving him Mora.The novelty of this made him quite popular in Mondstadt.There was just one snag - he couldn't help but sneeze if a cat came close...And if he happened to be holding a wine cup in his mouth when it happened... needless to say, it would spell disaster.Venti, therefore, has one golden rule when selecting a spot to perform, and that is that there must be no cats in the vicinity.Easier said than done - the stray cats of Mondstadt seem to be quite drawn to him.
There is a towering oak tree at the center of Windrise, said to have sprouted when Vennessa ascended to the heavens a millennium ago.In the past few months, travelers resting in the shade of the great oak sometimes hear a young boy singing the tales of Barbatos, the Anemo Archon.Unlike the ruling deities of the other nations, Barbatos has long left Mondstadt. In fact, the only visible proof of his connection with Mondstadt is the Statues of The Seven that appear across the land - even then, the resemblance is vague at best. Fortunately, Barbatos's past deeds are recorded in books and epics, sung and passed on by the bards.In contrast to these more canonical works, Venti's ballads tend to include bizarre adventures and acts of mischief, such as the time that Barbatos pinched the Cryo Archon's scepter and replaced it with a hilichurl's wooden club...Worshippers of Barbatos are quick to decry these frivolous tales as blasphemous fabrications. But whenever someone confronts Venti about this, his response suggests that he has not an ounce of remorse."How can you know that they're fabrications?"He has a point - even the most devoted sister could not possibly know the details of all of Barbatos's deeds from a millennium ago.Only Venti knows the truth behind his song lyrics, and it is a truth he hides behind an enigmatic smile.Reason being, yes - Venti's tall tales of Barbatos's unorthodox exploits are entirely fabricated.Hey, Venti finds that a few drinks really gets his muse going. Can you really blame him?
Around 2,600 years ago, the Archon War had yet to end, and the world had yet to fall under the dominion of The Seven.In those days, the city called "Mondstadt" was surrounded on all sides by gales impenetrable even to the birds of the air. The wind's ceaseless howling ground the soil and the rock of that city into smooth, flowing dust.The Lord of Wind who lived in his high tower was Decarabian, God of Storms. He squinted from on high at his subjects, who bowed before him in the unceasing wind, and, believing them submissive, thought this good.In those days, Venti was but a single thread of the thousand winds that roared through the northern lands.He who would in latter days be known as "Barbatos" was but a tiny elemental spirit, without a shred of divine dignity, a breeze that brought subtle changes for the better, or tiny seeds of hope.In Mondstadt of old, Venti met a Nameless Bard young boy. This lad knew how to play the lyre, and longed to write the greatest poem of all."I do so wish to see the birds in flight."So said the boy who had never seen the blue sky, eagles, or the green grass, his voice almost utterly drowned by the wind."Friend, will you not come along?"
The elemental being Venti obtained the feather of an eagle for the lad living in that storm-shrouded city, who had never seen a bird in his life.Then, war broke out in Mondstadt, in the name of freedom.With the feather tucked away in his breast pocket, Venti watched the fall of the eccentric ruler amid the wrack and ruin of revolt together with his friend.The ruler had believed that he had given his subjects a city free from the bitter cold, and to the end, he believed that they had loved him as he loved them.Yet, despite the victory, Venti was never able to give that feather to the lad, for that lad had fallen in the battle for the sake of song, sky, and birds, and for the people who, like him, had dwelled within the storm-wall.With the crumbling of an ancient seat of divinity, a new god was born. The Anemo Archon Barbatos felt power flowing at his fingertips.His first use of this power was to reconstitute himself in the likeness of that young lad.For only if he wore human shape could he play the lyre that the lad so loved.Plucking its strings, he scattered the ice and snow and split the mountains with a divine wind.He bade Mondstadt become a city of freedom, a nation without a king.In future, he believed, it would become a better, more romantic city."Surely, he too would have wanted to live in such a place."Thus, a new age began for Mondstadt.
The Anemo Archon cannot take credit for everything in Mondstadt.Credit should be given where credit is due, I shall sing now the praises of things beauteous and true:We thank the West Wind, whose enduring caressBrings the blossoms of Spring, by whose scent we are blessed.Finches, ducks, rabbits and boars,Mondstadt's revival bid them thrive evermore.In summer the lion walks the plains,No words one finds to praise it but these:Do you sweat out your water to make way for wine?Comes the heat of the summer from your mane of sunshine?The mountain mouths and gorges low like drunkards wayward lie...But the East Wind cares not, for it doesn't walk - it flies!Over the fruit trees it brushes low,And its wings bring the harvest of things that grow.The North Wind in the silent forest slumbers,And around it pace the wolves in their numbers.Though most have never a glimpse of them seen, for the Wind knows that none is of winter too keen,Yet the Anemo Archon glimpses and sees, that it dreams each night of warm reverie.-As the four seasons in turn shall say their piece, so the Four Winds four winds too shall never cease.Of course, to look at it differently, I am the one who should be credited here, and not they.Credits should be given where credits belong - if not for the bard who pens the song, then who shall ensure that these tales are passed on?
After 1,600 years of history, Mondstadt's "freedom" had sunk to a heretofore unseen low.Barbatos, unwilling to become a tyrant, had departed. But he had never imagined that those to whom he had gifted freedom would make for themselves a tyrant.The aristocracy ruled Mondstadt with a cruel hand, bringing slaves into this land and ignoring the cries of the oppressed.Thus the Anemo Archon returned after these 1,600 years to what was once the City of Freedom. He heard the cry of the slave girl Vennessa, and together with her raised a rebellion that overthrew the aristocracy.-Now, the above is what all know to be the official history of Mondstadt.The story has an interesting, little-known twist, however.The one who united the people of Mondstadt in this conflict was indeed the hero Vennessa - but that which caused many of the aristocracy's troops to turn coat was a "treachery against the wind."A secret treaty was found, a betrayal of the city - the aristocrats had forsaken the wind, and sold everything in Mondstadt to the Geo Archon of the neighboring land.At the treaty's end was carved an insignia inimitable by all save the deity so named: Rex Lapis.How the soldiers that had once oppressed the slaves shuddered when they saw that they too would become slaves in a foreign land.The news, and the conflict, spread like wildfire, consuming the aristocracy. It was only many years later that historians would discover that this treaty was fake.As it turned out, Venti had once practiced the art of forgery in order to play pranks on the Geo Archon, but could never deceive the god of wealth and transactions. Even so, his adeptness would come into play after several hundred years.What a happy coincidence.
The Seven Archons do not need Visions, for they already have great power.Yet Barbatos was fond of the mortal world, and wanted to roam Mondstadt more freely as "Venti." As such, he constructed a glass ornament very much like the Visions worn by those chosen by the gods.The imitation has no special abilities, nor does Venti rely on it to channel elemental power.However, since Venti does not keep the Holy Lyre der Himmel by his side, and since he is too lazy to bring a normal lyre, he gave his fake Vision the ability to turn into the wooden lyre "Der Frühling."

<title>Shogun's Army</title>
<text>The Shogun's Army is the army of the Raiden Shogun, Ei.
As a whole, the army primarily maintains peace and order throughout Inazuma. Members of the army are split up to help serve the Tri-Commission - the Kanjou Commission, the Tenryou Commission and the Yashiro Commission. Those of the Tenryou Commission are the predominant fighting force of the military, whereas the Kanjou Commission focuses on border security and the Yashiro Commission's role in the army focuses on protecting shrines, festivals, and public events. There are also those who directly serve under the Shogun, rather than any commission, such as the Hatamoto and the Okuzumeshuu.
There is also an ongoing military draft. A post on the Inazuma Commercial Street Bulletin Board Tenryou Notice: Military Draft Order Commercial Street Bulletin Board in Inazuma City from the Tenryou Commission orders all families who've received a draft order to send at least one adult to join the military.
Ranks
The Shogun's army has several known ranks. The ranks of the Raiden Shogun's military is modeled after that of the Tokugawa shogunate Tokugawa shogunate's military.
* Ashigaru ja=足軽 ja_rm=ashigaru ja_tl=foot soldier - In Japan, the Ashigaru were foot soldiers who served as the infantry of army. Although low-ranked, they made up the majority of the fighting force since they were in the many and were highly trained in the use of spears. In Genshin Impact, if you attempt to leave Ritou before completing Chisato's Letter, the Kanjou Commission Ashigaru Ashigaru of the Kanjou Commission will stop you.
* Doushin ja=同心 ja_rm=doushin ja_tl=patrol officer - In Japan, the Edo period police Samurai police Doushin were low-level soldiers who conducted general affairs and police work. There was a hierarchy within the Doushin; low-level Doushin were given duties such as prison patrol, whereas higher ranking Doushin conducted justice, investigation, and administration for the city. The term was also sometimes used to refer to low-ranking Samurai. In Genshin Impact, many Doushin can be seen patrolling Inazuma City.
* Yoriki ja=与力 ja_rm=yoriki ja_tl=assistant - In Japan, the Yoriki were middle-ranked Samurai. In military operations, they commanded the ashigaru and obeyed the orders of a hatamoto or daimyo. Among the different types of yoriki were the machikata yoriki under the machi-bugyo (town magistrate), who were in charge of police and commanded the doushin. In Genshin Impact, the Yoriki can be found patrolling Inazuma City and also on the battlefield at the Kujou Encampment.
* Hatamoto ja=旗本 ja_rm=hatamoto ja_tl=guardian of the banner - In Japan, the Hatamoto were high-ranking Samurai in direct service to the Shogun. The gokenin ja=御家人 was a rank below the Hatamoto, which was very similar to the Hatamoto rank but they did not have the right to seek audience with the Shogun, unlike the ome-mie ijō Hatamoto who had this right. In Genshin Impact, there are two known Hatamotos who are both stationed at Inazuma City guarding Tenshukaku.
* Okuzumeshuu ja=奥詰衆 ja_rm=okudzume-shuu - The Okuzumeshuu are the bodyguards of the Almighty Shogun, they only take orders directly from the Raiden Shogun. In Japan, the Okuzumeshuu was a position established near the end of the Tokugawa shogunate to serve as the Shogun's guard. It was a position highly trusted by the Shogun and members of the Okuzumeshuu were typically selected from mid-level Hatamoto, but also occasionally from high-rank Hatamoto or low-rank Daimyos.
* General ja=大将 ja_rm=taishou - The only known generals are Kujou Sara and Kujou Masahito. In the Tokugawa shogunate, there were different kinds of generals, such as the Ashigaru Taishou ja=足軽大将 (who commanded foot soldiers, ranked below Samurai Daishou), the Samurai Daishou ja=侍大将 (commanded an army, ranked above Ashigaru Taishou and below Sodaisho), or the Sodaisho ja=総大将 ja_tl=general of generals (the highest-ranking general in an army, ranked above Samurai Daishou). However, Genshin Impact does not specify what kind of general Kujou Sara is.
* Daimyo ja=大名 ja_rm=daimyou ja_tl=feudal lord - In Japan, the Daimyo were noble lords or famous warriors who controlled a lot of territory and subordinates. The Daimyo served directly under the Shogun. This term is not currently used in Genshin Impact, except in the fictional novel A Legend of Sword by Xingqiu. The Daimyo in Inazuma's case would be Kujou Takayuki, Hiiragi Shinsuke and Kamisato Ayato.
Unspecified Ranks:
* Shogunate Officer ja=幕府の軍官 ja_rm=bakufu no gunkan ja_tl=shogunate officer - A generic term for an officer of any rank in the Inazuma Bakufu. There are high-rank officers such as Kujou Masahito, and lower-rank officers such as Toranosuke.
* Shogunate Samurai ja=幕府の兵士 ja_rm=bakufu no heishi ja_tl=shogunate soldier - A generic term for a soldier of the Inazuma Bakufu. The in-game Japanese text directly translates to "Shogunate Soldiers" rather than "Shogunate Samurai."
Enemies
Shogunate Samurai
Some Shogunate forces can be encountered in Archon Quests as enemies. Despite appearing as enemies, they cannot be found in the Archive Enemies and Monsters "Living Beings   Enemies and Monsters" section of the Archive, likely due to the fact that there is no way to fight them outside of specific Archon Quests.

<title>Adeptus</title>
<text>Illuminated Beasts
The adepti zh=仙 zh_rm=Xiān, singular 'adeptus', are a group in Liyue that consists of both illuminated beasts and gods. Most of them are bound by a contract to protect Liyue from demons and evil godsYakshas: The Guardian Adepti and are led by the Prime of Adepti, Morax Rex Lapis himself.
Terminology
What exactly is defined by the term "adepti" is ambiguous, and is further obfuscated by the English localization's translation of several related but distinct terms interchangeably: 仙 rm=xiān, 仙人 rm=xiānrén, 仙兽 rm=xiānshòu, 仙众 rm=xiānzhòng, and 仙家 rm=xiānjiā are all translated as "adepti" or "illuminated beast." While the original Chinese text also does not clearly delineate the terms, there is more specificity in how they are used.
仙 rm=xiān tl=illuminated immortal, refers to the concept of Taoism Daoist 'Xian (Taoism) xian', who are people or entities with either extreme longevity or immortality, typically as a result of spiritual enlightenment. The word can take on a variety of meanings depending on the context, but in the context of the adepti, it typically refers to beings who have reached enlightenment and spiritual immortality. In-game, within the context of Liyue, this term is used to broadly refer to all types of adepti.
仙人 rm=xiānrén tl=illuminated immortal person, comprises the characters 仙 tl=illuminated immortal + 人 tl=person, people, mortal(s). In-game, this term is typically used for all 'xian' who follow Morax, whether they take beastlike or humanlike forms. It is an abbreviation of "the Mighty and Illuminated Adepti" zh=三眼五显仙人 zh_tl=Three Eyes, Five Manifestations Illuminated Immortal [Person]. The term does not specify singular or plural and can be used to refer to an individual adeptus or multiple adepti, although plural forms of the term exist as well (see 'xiānzhòng').
仙兽 rm=xiānshòu tl=illuminated immortal beast, refers to animals and beasts who have or are capable of reaching enlightenment, such as the qilin. Those who are illuminated beasts and follow Morax can be referred to as both 'xianren' and 'xianshou'. In the original Chinese text, humans with illuminated beast blood in their veins typically refer to their 'xianshou' lineage, and not a 'xianren' lineage. There are a few exceptions; for example, when Ganyu talks about adeptus blood in 'Solitary Fragrance', she uses 'xianren' instead of 'xianshou'. Her Ganyu Lore Character Stories character stories always use 'xianshou', though the English version inconsistently translates it as both "adeptus" and "illuminated beast."
仙众 rm=xiānzhòng tl=illuminated immortal group, generally refers to a subset of adepti, or to the adepti as a collective.
仙家 rm=xiānjiā tl=illuminated immortal clan, is used in terms that pertain to the adepti collectively, such as adeptal techniques or possessions. For example, the Chinese description for Eye of Perception says that the weapon belonged to the 'xianjia'. The term 仙家气运 rm=xiānjiā qìyùn tl=illuminated immortal clan's destiny, localized as "adeptal energy" and "adeptal power," refers to a power which is harmful to ordinary humans;Wangshu notably, this is separate from 仙力 rm=xiānlì tl=illuminated immortal power, another term localized as "adeptal energy." ('Xianli' is the type of adeptal energy bestowed on the Traveler during 'Turning Point' and used in the Serenitea Pot.) 'Xianjia' has also been used as an honorific form of 'xianren'.Sky-Gazers, Land-Walkers
Overview
Most adepti are illuminated beasts - beings beyond the ken of normal mortals and are often worshipped like deities by the people of Liyue - or have illuminated beast blood in their veins. Some gods have also been referred to as adepti: Morax is known as the Prime of Adepti zh=众仙之祖 zh_tl=ancestor of the adepti,An Organization Known as Wangsheng while Marchosius was also considered one.
Very little is known about the origins of adepti and illuminated beasts. Morax is presumably the progenitor of the adepti in some shape or form, having personally given his "blessings" to grant several adepti their illumination, including Madame Ping.A Teapot to Call Home: Part I Some believe that they descended from Celestia and return there once they die.MushengRainslasher According to legend, humans could ascend to Celestia and join the ranks of the adepti, and those who sought the path of the adepti had to pass the "trials of heaven and earth." The trial of "earth" was taken inside of the Taishan Mansion,Taishan Mansion while the location for the trial of "heaven" was the Dwelling in the Clouds.
Because humans have a "higher purpose" than adepti in the world of Teyvat, only those of non-human status can be referred to as adepti.HoYoverse News:  While legends exist of humans joining the ranks of the adepti,Qingzhou and humans are capable of learning adepti arts,Away With Obsessions and Falsehood they are not considered adepti.Seagaze Sunset However, half-blooded humans can qualify as adepti.Solitary Fragrance
Appearance
The adepti have a large range in terms of appearance, but most of them take on their true, illuminated beast forms when appearing before mortals.Web Event, Stone Harbor Treasure Journal Story Reading Stone Harbor Treasure Journal, Reading (Zhongli), Chinese version: [三眼五显仙人]们大多都以兽形示人 tl=A majority of the Mighty and Illuminated Adepti take the forms of beasts when appearing before mortals. Full-blooded adepti are capable of shapeshifting into a human form, and some - such as Madame Ping and Xiao - prefer such a form.Xiao's Developer Insight states that the tattoo on his arm depicts an illuminated beast and is related to his "true form," indicating he did not always have a human form. It is also apparent that the adepti can change the appearance of their human form; Madame Ping's appearance as an old lady is not caused by aging, but is instead said to be from her own choice. She has been depicted to be in a youthful form in the past.A Single Harmony for an Irreplaceable Soul However, other adepti, like Moon Carver, take pride in their beast forms and refuse to use human disguises.
So far, known half-blooded humans take on a humanoid appearance with a few distinguishing traits from their illuminated beast blood. It has not been suggested that they have the ability to shapeshift or otherwise take on a more beastlike form.
Culture
Many cultural aspects revolving around the adepti are derived from real-world Taoism Daoism and Buddhism, though within the world of Teyvat, such concepts are seen as the path of the adepti.
One aspect of adeptal culture is the use of sacred names,Adeptus Art: Preserver of Fortune also known as adeptus names. In the Chinese version, most sacred names contain four characters that serve as a name, followed by the honorific title 真君 tl=perfected lord. The English translation typically renders the first two characters and leaves out the honorific title. For example, 削月筑阳真君 tl=The Perfected Lord who Carves the Moon and Builds the Sun is rendered as Moon Carver, translating only the 削月 part of the title.During one of the Closed Beta Tests, some sacred names were translated in full; Moon Carver, for example, was "Perfected Lord of Descending Sun and Ascending Moon." It appears the translation team later decided that direct translations were too clunky and wordy, and truncated them for readability.
There are sacred names that use different naming schemes, typically used by those with a special place among the adepti. The Chinese version of "Rex Lapis" is 岩王帝君 rm=Yánwáng Dìjūn tl=The Sovereign Lord Rock King, which uses the higher-ranking honorific 帝君 tl=sovereign lord compared to most adepti's 真君 tl=perfected lord. In a similar vein, the Chinese version of Xiao's title, Conqueror of Demons, is 降魔大圣 tl=Great Sage who Subdues Demons, which forgoes the "lord" honorific system entirely. In both cases, their sacred names (excluding the honorific) are also only two characters long instead of the conventional four.
While sacred names are associated with the adepti, they have been applied to non-adepti as well. The adepti-created teapot spirits like Tubby and Chubby have sacred names despite not being considered adepti. Qiqi is heavily suggested to bear the sacred name Fortune Preserver zh=救苦度厄真君 following her resurrection at the hands of the adepti, even though Shenhe, who was personally trained by multiple adepti, explicitly lacks a sacred name since she is human. There is also nothing stopping from ordinary humans from giving themselves sacred names to pose as adepti, as seen with Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz zh=霹雳闪雷真君 and Starsnatcher zh=掇星攫辰天君.
On top of that, not all adepti use sacred names, as seen with Madame Ping and Ganyu. The former's sacred name is Streetward Rambler zh=歌尘浪市真君, but she took on the alias of Madame Ping upon integrating herself into human society. It is unclear if Ganyu has a sacred name but uses an ordinary name to blend in with humans, or if she never had one to begin with. While Xiao has a sacred name, it is typically used by other adepti or by humans knowledgeable about the adepti; when Xiao gives his name to the Traveler, he tells them to call him "Adeptus Xiao."
Powers and Abilities
All adepti possess the ability to manipulate elemental energy, which mortals equate to having a Vision; this led to the "three-eyed" part of the adepti's full Chinese title. It is unclear whether the adepti's ability to manipulate elemental energy follows the same rules as humans'. For example, beastlike adepti do not have Visions located externally on their bodies, leading humans to conclude that they possess "inner eyes" located within their bodies and are not visible on their bodies. Xiao wears a Vision because he appears in a humanlike form and thus follows human convention, and whether this Vision has the same origins as a human's has been left ambiguous.
Adepti possess adeptal energy zh=仙家气运 zh_rm=xiānjiā qìyùn that has a unique effect based on the individual. When the Traveler was infused with three adepti's energies, Madame Ping's created intermittent shockwaves upon attacking, Ganyu's granted passive healing, and Xiao's increased movement speed.Turning Point It is unclear whether adeptal energy is linked to their "third eye," or if it is an independent power.
For normal humans, prolonged interaction with adepti will become dangerous, as their souls are not as robust and adeptal energy will overwhelm them with enough time. When a dying Qiqi was infused with several adepti's energies, it was powerful enough to prevent her from fully dying - but because it was too much for a mortal to bear, sent her on a rampage that was only stopped by trapping her in amber for hundreds of years. Even after hundreds of years, she is still capable of manipulating that adeptal energy as a zombie.
According to Liyue beliefs, adepti formed the landscape; for example, rivers are adepti saliva, while grass is adepti hair. Mountain Shaper denies those claims as "nonsense," and explains that the Amber Rock amber found on Mt. Hulao is in fact created by a plant called the karst crawler. However, he is capable of controlling the plant to a certain degree and has to make sure the plant will not trap innocent beings before he leaves the area.Moulder of Mountains
Adepti are capable of creating domains - known as abodesLiyue Abode - through Sub-Space Creation for their personal use, even granting them different forms such as teapots.The Realm Within This ability was granted by Rex Lapis and is part of the "illumination" in "Mighty and Illuminated Adepti."
There are several esoteric techniques used by the adepti. One of them is the "gifting of dreams and visions," used by Zhongli to inform the other adepti and the Liyue Qixing that Morax had not actually died, but had chosen to retire from his role.The Fond Farewell Another is Dream Trawler, which is primarily used to separate the soul from the body for self-cultivation but can also be used to summon another's spirit; Xiao and the Traveler use it to summon Starsnatcher's spirit.The Purging of Evil Pervases uses Mortal Lingering to temporarily regain a physical vessel.Insights of Drifting Dreams
Story
Before and During the Archon War
It is unclear how long the adepti have existed as a formally recognized group, but they were said to have fought for Guizhong and Morax during the Archon War to defend the Guili Assembly,Stone Tablet Compilations: Vol. ITreasure Lost, Treasure Found (Part 1) and Xianyun Cloud Retainer was friends with them before the fall of the Guili Assembly.Custodian of Clouds
After the destruction of the Guili Assembly, Morax led his adepti and his people south of Mt. Tianheng, where he established Liyue Harbor. There, the adepti signed a contract with him to protect Liyue. At some point during the war, Morax gathered the yakshas, particularly belligerent illuminated beasts, to assist him in the task of subduing the remnants of other gods defeated during the war.
Morax would later enter a conflict with a then unknown god of Chenyu Vale, which was implied to have been extremely bloody, as Little Mao claims that the Bishui River was crimson red from all the bloodshed. At the end of the war, the god attempted to flood the Bishui River in a final attempt to defeat Morax, which would have destroyed the vale. The god's own adepti, the Herblord and Fujin, turned against her. The Herblord presumably defeated its former master while Fujin threw the Rainjade Votive into the river to stop it from flooding. This act took much of Fujin's strength, and she would be stuck in her realm for thousands of years.Qiaoying of the Sacred Mountain The Herblord eventually left when the situation was resolved.
During a battle between adepti and demons, Qiqi trespassed the realm of adepti by mistake while picking herbs and was mortally wounded in the crossfire. The adepti came together to resurrect her as a zombie by imbuing her with their powers, though the energy was too much for her, resulting in Mountain Shaper having to seal her in amber.
Present
Since the end of the Archon War two thousand years ago, with their immense strength no longer needed to fight the gods that opposed Morax, most adepti have gone into seclusion in Jueyun Karst, cut off from the rest of the world and watching over Liyue from afar.Verses of EquilibriumThe Yaksha's Wish This land is considered sacred and mortals are not to set foot in it - those that do enter are considered either brave or desperate. Allegedly, only mortals with a Sigil of Permission in their possession are granted access to enter without offending the adepti. However, several NPCs can be found in the adepti's lands without having come to any harm, though they have not been granted audience with the adepti in return.
According to legend, some adepti decided that they did not want to wait around for their lives to come to a natural end and asked Morax to transform them into stone statues. It is said that these stone statues are capable of moving around even in this state.Records of Jueyun: Stone Beasts
Some adepti stayed in Liyue Harbor to assist the Liyue Qixing in managing the nation's affairs. However, by the events of Chapter I, they have long been excluded from Liyue's politics with the exception of Ganyu, who serves as a general secretary. Madame Ping has resided in the city for a long time. Eventually, Cloud Retainer, wanting to see what made the harbor special for Ganyu and Shenhe, would also move into the harbor under the alias Xianyun.
Although it has become simplified over time and is beginning to fade into obscurity, it is a Liyue tradition to mark the passing of every adeptus with a memorial service called the Rite of Parting. This service is handled by the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, though they have only had to host this service a handful of times throughout the past three thousand years.
When Chenyu Vale was opened, Lingyuan attempted to restore the vale to its original state before it was touched by humans, as she yearned for the days of old when the land was not "subjugated" by humans. She slowly began to revert the soil and water to an older state, causing the quality of tea production in Qiaoying Village to decline. As an unintended consequence, miasma began erupting across the vale. Fujin, who was aware of the events, manages to discover the Traveler and restores the land at the cost of more of her powers, causing her to revert back to her original form as a carp and temporarily unable to assume her human form.

However, the Chinese term 仙人 rm=xiānrén does not distinguish between singular or plural without additional context, making it possible for the Ballista to be built by multiple people. with Cloud Retainer among its creators.

Kunwu has not yet been linked back to the adepti in any global release material.

Trivia
* The concept for the adepti came from the Chinese novel 'Journey to the West', in which it is stated that "All beings in the upper worlds that have nine apertures can become Immortals." This statement is used to justify treating the main character, the monkey Sun Wukong, equal to a human in his ability to cultivate the way of immortality, and is tied to the reason why most of the adepti have animal-like forms.
* The weapon Eye of Perception is said to be of adepti origin, which was passed onto the Yun Family who proceeded to create the Prototype Series Prototype weapons.
* The Chinese name for seelie, 仙灵 rm=xiānlíng tl=fairy spirit, uses the same 仙 rm=xiān in their name for adepti. However, it likely uses the "fairy" definition for the term rather than the "illuminated immortal" definition, and there has currently been no direct connection made between seelie and adepti.
* When Yae Miko calls herself a "fox envoy" in 'The Omnipresent God', she calls herself a 狐仙 tl=fox 'xian' in the original Chinese text, which is interesting considering other instances of "fox envoy" in the English text correspond with the Chinese term 狐狸神使 tl=fox god envoy instead.The Whispers of the Crane and the White Rabbit 狐仙 is more directly translated as "fox spirits" in Kaede's dialogue.
* The achievement 'Mighty and Illuminated Wave Rider' cheekily names the Waverider "Wave Rider," or 乘風破浪真君 tl=The Perfected Lord Who Rides the Wind and Splits the Waves.
* Adepti,
Etymology
* The adepti are synonymous with the Xian (Taoism) Xian (Taoist Immortals), and are referred to as such (仙人/仙人) in the Chinese and Japanese versions of the game.
** In English, those who dedicate their lives to practicing Taoism are often called "Taoist adepts,"Google Books: , mentions of "adept"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy:  which is where the term "adeptus/adepti" in the English localization derives from.
* In Chinese, and in some translations other than English, their titles include the honorific title 真君 rm=zhēnjūn tl=perfected lord, typically given to Taoist immortals.Google Books:  (mentions of 真君)
** 真君 rm=Zhēnjūn is a lower-ranking title than the 帝君 rm=dìjūn tl=sovereign honorific used by Rex Lapis Trivia Rex Lapis.
* Although the word 'adeptus' ends in '-us' and the plural form 'adepti' ends in '-i' like many masculine and neuter nouns in Latin, there is no separate feminine form, such as 'adepta', used in the English localization of 'Genshin Impact'. Cloud Retainer refers to herself as an "adeptus" in the Custodian of Clouds, and Guizhong, Madame Ping, and Shenhe have all been repeatedly described with "adeptus."
** The sole exception is in the text written in the Teyvat Script on Shenhe's poster during Of Drink A-Dreaming, which describes Shenhe as an "adepta." However, given the numerous deviations from the English localization that have been found in the texts written in the game's languages after Version 1.3 as well as certain key deviations that align more closely with the original Chinese version, it appears that the process of writing in the game's languages is completely separate from the game's localization process. As such, the use of "adepta" to describe Shenhe is likely not official.
